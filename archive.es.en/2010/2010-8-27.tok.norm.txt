dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .

he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "

so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .

they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .

it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he does n't say how long the camp will remain there .
the extent of the flood is so huge that the consequences too will be massive .
even if the flood waters recede many people will remain dependent on help for a long time .

" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .

dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "

dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media . " internet platforms like youtube are the current and future way for musicians to reach their fans to promote their work , or even have their break through into business , " he told deutsche welle . a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pop star justin bieber was discovered on youtube by failing to give a definite judgment on youtube 's copyright policy , the court 's decision leaves the door open for further litigation between gema and you tube .

german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .

german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .

the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 27.08.2010 new veterans ' association reassesses german army 's role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say soldiers ' interests are not adequately represented the german army now has its own veterans ' association .
the organization adds a new element to the debate about the position of the bundeswehr in german society , and hopes to rehabilitate the war veterans . the bund deutscher veteranen -lrb- association of german veterans -rrb- came into existence last saturday .
using the occasion of the german government 's official open day , it set up a stand in the defense ministry and introduced itself to the public .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg spent some time at the stand , and spoke to several german veterans representing the nascent organization .
once its establishment has been officially sealed , the bdv intends to apply for financial support from the government .
its founder is lieutenant-colonel andreas timmermann-levanas , veteran of the german military missions in afghanistan and bosnia .
timmermann-levanas also founded deutsche kriegsopferfürsorge -lrb- german war victims ' welfare -rrb- , an organization that cares for soldiers who return from missions with physical or psychological injuries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg spoke to veterans at the government open day unwounded but unheard the bdv grew out of the growing number not represented by that organization .
timmermann-levanas told deutsche welle , " the demand kept coming , ' what about the ones who were n't wounded ? '
we have to care for those too .
we have to give them a voice .
for those , the current institutions were not enough . "
timmermann-levanas could not say exactly how many membership applications have already come in to the bdv , as it is still officially in the process of being established , but he said there were " very many " people interested .
indeed , the potential community for the bdv is surprisingly large .
since 1955 , when the post-war german army was established under its new name the bundeswehr , -lrb- replacing the world war ii-era wehrmacht -rrb- 280,000 german soldiers have been on international missions , either in wars , in ' war-like conflicts , ' as german politicians sometimes refer to afghanistan , or on purely humanitarian missions .
but anyone over 18 , german or not , who agrees with the association 's aims can become a member .
there are important caveats , of course : " we do n't want to be instrumentalized by any far-right groups , or any political groups for that matter , " says timmermann-levanas .
rehabilitating the veteran germany 's history puts any organization related to the military in the middle of a tortuous and unending debate .
the bdv is hoping to avoid this by placing the emphasis on representing the post-war army , but in doing so , it wants society to rethink its whole attitude the veteran .
" i think we can contribute to making society discuss what exactly a veteran is , " timmermann-levanas argues .
" in germany we have associated the veteran with something negative for the last 60 years - understandably in view of the history .
if you think of the old veteran 's associations from the second world war , if you think of the wehrmacht , then you 're right back into the discussion about tradition - is the german army itself good or bad ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr will never be entirely free of the shadow of the wehrmacht the bdv wants to take its cue from veterans ' associations that were established in the us after the vietnam war , when returning soldiers were vilified and ostracized by a public that condemned them .
this is a circumstance unknown elsewhere .
robert lee , spokesman for the royal british legion , a welfare organization responsible for serving the interests of british military personnel and their families , says uk public opinion about the army makes no distinction between world war ii and post-war soldiers .
" the needs of the post-war service community is a large part of what we do , given the amount of time that has passed since 1945 and the number of conflicts the uk has been involved with since 1945 , " lee said .
" in this country there is a very active program of public recognition for sacrifices made in all conflicts , including the ongoing conflict in afghanistan . "
distinguishing the military from politics but as opposed to the us , where " support the troops , not the war " campaigns have become common , in germany there has never been a groundswell of support for soldiers independent of the government 's military policy .
this is precisely what the bdv is aiming for .
" we are simply calling for respect and recognition for what these people did for the german state , independent of whether you approve politically of this or that specific mission , " timmermann-levanas said .
but most reactions to the founding of the association have been positive .
comments on internet forums have mainly said that such an organization is long overdue .
in fact , there have been german veterans ' associations since the napoleonic wars , but the bdv has a very specific notion of its responsibilities .
" we do n't want to be associated with some misunderstood concept of military pride , " says timmermann-levanas .
" i believe the german army has a tradition since 1955 that we can be proud of .
we do n't know want to go back and honor certain battles or only accept people who have won military honors . "
overdue reconciliation timmermann-levanas was also hopeful that cooperation would be organized with veterans ' associations abroad , and contact has already been established with equivalent organizations in the us and the netherlands .
there has been no contact with the royal british legion yet .
since there were no german veterans ' organizations until now , the legion has not organized exchange or ' reconciliation ' trips with german counterparts since before world war ii .
robert lee told deutsche welle , " we 've not yet heard from this organization , but we look forward to hearing from it , and we will consider whatever it is they propose . "
perhaps a new cooperation is also long overdue .

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media . " internet platforms like youtube are the current and future way for musicians to reach their fans to promote their work , or even have their break through into business , " he told deutsche welle . a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pop star justin bieber was discovered on youtube by failing to give a definite judgment on youtube 's copyright policy , the court 's decision leaves the door open for further litigation between gema and you tube .
but youtube is hoping it wo n't come to that . " this is a goal that ca n't be achieved through a judicial process , " dorstewitz said .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .

basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a makeshift roma camp was dismantled in the city of lille french police also dismantled a campsite in lille as part of president nicolas sarkozy 's major crackdown on crime that began earlier this month .
police have targeted the roma community , along with other itinerant groups .
the crackdown has sparked major criticism at home and abroad .
former french prime minister dominique de villepin said sarkozy 's policies had left a " stain of shame " on the french flag and were a " national indignity . "
growing international condemnation human rights organization amnesty international said sarkozy risked stigmatizing the minority group .
" french officials should be working to fight discrimination , rather than making inflammatory statements linking entire communities to alleged criminality , " the organization said in a statement .
amnesty is alarmed that the rhetoric " could perpetuate negative stereotypes which contribute to the stigmatization of and discrimination against roma and travelers . "
earlier this month a united nations panel warned of mounting racism and xenophobia in france , citing the roma evictions .
the european union 's justice commissioner is currently reviewing whether the crackdown is legal .
opinion polls show support for the crackdown the french government insists it is simply clamping down on illegal immigration and trying to protect its citizens from crime , saying roma camps are sources of people-trafficking and prostitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international joined critics of sarkozy 's crackdown opinion polls in france showed solid public support for the expulsions , despite the widespread criticism .
a survey published in le figaro said 69 percent of people questioned supported the dismantling of the roma camps , and 65 percent backed the deportations .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .

the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .

some say she got off too easy , some say she can do no wrong . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case the high-profile case of german pop singer nadja benaissa , who was charged with aggravated assault for having unprotected sex while she knew she was hiv positive , has ended in a two-year suspended sentence .

he also urged bosnians to stand united to boost their chances of eu membership . german foreign minister guido westerwelle has reinforced germany 's stance on kosovo 's independence on the last leg of his balkan tour in pristina on friday , calling on all eu states to accept the status of the former serbian province , which serbia still regards as part of its territory . " there is concern in several countries ... that the recognition of kosovo could mean something for other conflicts in other states , " westerwelle said .

he also urged bosnians to stand united to boost their chances of eu membership . german foreign minister guido westerwelle has reinforced germany 's stance on kosovo 's independence on the last leg of his balkan tour in pristina on friday , calling on all eu states to accept the status of the former serbian province , which serbia still regards as part of its territory . " there is concern in several countries ... that the recognition of kosovo could mean something for other conflicts in other states , " westerwelle said .
" this is not the case . " kosovo has been recognized as an independent state by 69 countries , including 22 in the eu .
cyprus , spain , greece , slovakia and romania - all of which are grappling with rebellious domestic groups - have refused to accept its independence . " the recognition of kosovo is a case of sui generis , " westerwelle said " twenty-two states have decided as germany did .
five others are hesitating .
i ask them after the clear decision of the court : follow the majority in the european union . " court ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 westerwelle was referring to the july ruling of the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- that declared kosovo 's independence in line with international law . westerwelle also discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . " one chance , not several " earlier on friday , westerwelle urged bosnian leaders to work towards unifying their country , if bosnia-herzegovina is to have a chance of joining the eu . " bosnia 's future is in europe , but the road to europe involves striving for unity and consensus , " he said in sarajevo .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " the country is divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska .
since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government . bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede .
he did not turn up for a planned meeting with westerwelle on thursday . westerwelle warned against a split , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . author : nicole goebel -lrb- dpa / reuters / afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say she got off too easy , some say she can do no wrong . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 27.08.2010 letterpress printers are an island of tradition in modern berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the birthplace of the modern printing press and , even today , berlin is home to a number of letterpress printers .
dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .
basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .
it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .

the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 27.08.2010 letterpress printers are an island of tradition in modern berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the birthplace of the modern printing press and , even today , berlin is home to a number of letterpress printers .
dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .
basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .
it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .
basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .
it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !

bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .

the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 27.08.2010 september 2010 : dw 's culture calendar from music and art to film and dance - find out what 's going on in germany 's cultural scene .
deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .
basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .
it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 27.08.2010 schumacher returns to site of his f1 debut under mounting pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 20 years on , the grin - and the chin - has hardly changed in 1991 , a fresh-faced , lanky german suddenly appeared at the formula one paddock at spa francorchamps in belgium .
multiple world champion alain prost asked future champ nigel mansell if he was a new mechanic .
he was n't . " spa has always been my favorite racetrack , " michael schumacher said this week of the spa francorchamps circuit in belgium .
and with such happy memories there , it 's little wonder .
his formula one debut remains the stuff of legend , even though his race was over in about 20 seconds because of a faulty clutch .
but by the time the lights went green on sunday , schumacher had already cemented his reputation as the next big thing .
the hand-to-mouth jordan outfit , which boasted a fairly quick car but precious little else in its debut f1 season , had suddenly found itself short of a racer after belgian veteran bertrand gachot was sent to prison for assaulting a london taxi driver .
the team chose a 22-year-old from the mercedes young driver program , but not for the reasons you might expect .
" we needed somebody to pay for the engine bills , the tire bills , he was about the only one who could do that , " team owner eddie jordan confessed years later .
" he paid , he got in the car .
i 'd love to claim it was all to do with talent - it 's not true , i needed the money . "
thanks to mercedes and dekra - a vehicles inspection and appraisals firm that has stuck with schumacher as sponsor throughout his career - the young german found the cash to secure his drive , but only after his manager willi weber told a few fibs to convince jordan that the youngster was up to the task .
home advantage ?
weber claimed schumacher knew the spa francorchamps circuit , one of the most demanding and deadly in the world , " as if it were his home track " .
in reality , he had never raced there in his life , but it did n't take long to find a rhythm .
" the first three laps made a really big impression , " schumacher said after his first ever outing at spa , and his second in an f1 car .
" but after that you get used to the new environment very quickly .
it 's definitely something out of the ordinary , but having said that , it 's really not all that special . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fortnight after his jordan debut , schumacher wore the united colors of benetton schumacher was the eighth fastest qualifier , four places and three-quarters of a second faster than the regular , experienced jordan lead driver , andrea de cesaris .
" that guy 's got a special talent .
he could become a threat to us , " reigning world champion ayrton senna commented after the qualifying session .
this was to be schumacher 's first and last race for jordan .
bernie ecclestone , formula one 's commercial supremo and string-puller extraordinaire , had recognized the young german 's talent and was already working to secure his move to the higher-profile benetton team .
after some at best questionable back-room deals , the wunderkind from kerpen was installed there in time for the next race at monza .
true to form , schumacher had needed just one race to create both sensation and scandal in the sport .
the next major milestone followed a year later , back in belgium .
in a wet race , schumacher claimed his maiden victory at spa , despite a massively inferior car compared to the all-conquering williams renaults of 1992 .
more of the same … please schumacher won six times at spa in his " first career " and he 'd surely love to roll back the years this weekend after a thus far lackluster comeback with the mercedes grand prix team .
so far , he has n't added a single pole position , win , or podium finish to his frankly intimidating f1 stats sheet , though that is n't quite as disappointing as it sounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher 's not yet tasted the 2010 podium vintage the present mercedes " just is n't a race winning car , " autosport editor , andy van der burgt told deutsche welle .
" and i do n't think there 's a condition out there that 's going to make it a race-winning car . "
but even if you factor in the substandard machinery , there is another problem ; schumacher has amassed 38 points so far this year , while his young german team mate nico rosberg has scored 94 , in an identical car .
" if michael is not at least somewhat competitive at spa , " senior editor at motorsport-total.com , christian nimmervoll told deutsche welle , " then he 's really going to have to explain and defend his decision to come back . "
" if he 's slower than his team mate nico rosberg again at his ' home ' track - where he started , where he beat the williams in ' 92 in an uncompetitive benetton - that would be a really symbolic defeat . "
compromised from the start the only thing schumacher is likely to be able to show at spa , however , is speed - that elusive first comeback podium has been all but written off before a wheel 's even turned .
after the qualifying session this weekend , schumacher will be sent ten grid-positions back from wherever he would otherwise have started the race , a punishment carried over from the last grand prix in hungary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrcihello , l . , and schumacher were once team mates , but it was n't an equal partnership in the dying laps , scrapping with rubens barrichello for 10th position , schumacher squeezed the brazilian towards the pit wall at high speed , in a failed bid to stop the brazilian getting through .
" if michael wants to go to heaven - in the event that he 's going to heaven - then i do n't really care .
but i do n't want to go before him , " barrichello said on german television , still shaking , after the race .
" i 'd be amazed if barrichello was in a forgiving mood after that , " autosport 's andy van der burgt said of the incident .
" i thought it was one of the most outrageously dangerous pieces of driving i have ever seen .
there 's giving someone a squeeze , and then there 's trying to smash someone into the wall at 190 miles per hour . "
ironically , this was one of the few glimpses of " the old schumacher " visible in 2010 , but it was his ruthless competitiveness on display , not his racing genius .
" i think the most amazing fact about this duel in hungary was not that michael pushed so hard , " said motorsport journalist christian nimmervoll , " it was that he eventually lost the battle .
for me , that 's his biggest problem right now . "
another major problem would be the exorbitant expectations that come with a record like schumacher 's , even when competing after a three year hiatus against drivers like sebastian vettel - who celebrated his fourth birthday a few weeks before michael schumacher 's f1 debut at spa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .
the territory , which belgrade still regards as a serbian province , declared independence in early 2008 . author : joanna impey / richard connor -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .
the territory , which belgrade still regards as a serbian province , declared independence in early 2008 . author : joanna impey / richard connor -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 27.08.2010 new veterans ' association reassesses german army 's role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say soldiers ' interests are not adequately represented the german army now has its own veterans ' association .
the organization adds a new element to the debate about the position of the bundeswehr in german society , and hopes to rehabilitate the war veterans . the bund deutscher veteranen -lrb- association of german veterans -rrb- came into existence last saturday .
using the occasion of the german government 's official open day , it set up a stand in the defense ministry and introduced itself to the public .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg spent some time at the stand , and spoke to several german veterans representing the nascent organization .
once its establishment has been officially sealed , the bdv intends to apply for financial support from the government .
its founder is lieutenant-colonel andreas timmermann-levanas , veteran of the german military missions in afghanistan and bosnia .
timmermann-levanas also founded deutsche kriegsopferfürsorge -lrb- german war victims ' welfare -rrb- , an organization that cares for soldiers who return from missions with physical or psychological injuries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg spoke to veterans at the government open day unwounded but unheard the bdv grew out of the growing number not represented by that organization .
timmermann-levanas told deutsche welle , " the demand kept coming , ' what about the ones who were n't wounded ? '
we have to care for those too .
we have to give them a voice .
for those , the current institutions were not enough . "
timmermann-levanas could not say exactly how many membership applications have already come in to the bdv , as it is still officially in the process of being established , but he said there were " very many " people interested .
indeed , the potential community for the bdv is surprisingly large .
since 1955 , when the post-war german army was established under its new name the bundeswehr , -lrb- replacing the world war ii-era wehrmacht -rrb- 280,000 german soldiers have been on international missions , either in wars , in ' war-like conflicts , ' as german politicians sometimes refer to afghanistan , or on purely humanitarian missions .
but anyone over 18 , german or not , who agrees with the association 's aims can become a member .
there are important caveats , of course : " we do n't want to be instrumentalized by any far-right groups , or any political groups for that matter , " says timmermann-levanas .
rehabilitating the veteran germany 's history puts any organization related to the military in the middle of a tortuous and unending debate .
the bdv is hoping to avoid this by placing the emphasis on representing the post-war army , but in doing so , it wants society to rethink its whole attitude the veteran .
" i think we can contribute to making society discuss what exactly a veteran is , " timmermann-levanas argues .
" in germany we have associated the veteran with something negative for the last 60 years - understandably in view of the history .
if you think of the old veteran 's associations from the second world war , if you think of the wehrmacht , then you 're right back into the discussion about tradition - is the german army itself good or bad ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr will never be entirely free of the shadow of the wehrmacht the bdv wants to take its cue from veterans ' associations that were established in the us after the vietnam war , when returning soldiers were vilified and ostracized by a public that condemned them .
this is a circumstance unknown elsewhere .
robert lee , spokesman for the royal british legion , a welfare organization responsible for serving the interests of british military personnel and their families , says uk public opinion about the army makes no distinction between world war ii and post-war soldiers .
" the needs of the post-war service community is a large part of what we do , given the amount of time that has passed since 1945 and the number of conflicts the uk has been involved with since 1945 , " lee said .
" in this country there is a very active program of public recognition for sacrifices made in all conflicts , including the ongoing conflict in afghanistan . "
distinguishing the military from politics but as opposed to the us , where " support the troops , not the war " campaigns have become common , in germany there has never been a groundswell of support for soldiers independent of the government 's military policy .
this is precisely what the bdv is aiming for .
" we are simply calling for respect and recognition for what these people did for the german state , independent of whether you approve politically of this or that specific mission , " timmermann-levanas said .
but most reactions to the founding of the association have been positive .
comments on internet forums have mainly said that such an organization is long overdue .
in fact , there have been german veterans ' associations since the napoleonic wars , but the bdv has a very specific notion of its responsibilities .
" we do n't want to be associated with some misunderstood concept of military pride , " says timmermann-levanas .
" i believe the german army has a tradition since 1955 that we can be proud of .
we do n't know want to go back and honor certain battles or only accept people who have won military honors . "
overdue reconciliation timmermann-levanas was also hopeful that cooperation would be organized with veterans ' associations abroad , and contact has already been established with equivalent organizations in the us and the netherlands .
there has been no contact with the royal british legion yet .
since there were no german veterans ' organizations until now , the legion has not organized exchange or ' reconciliation ' trips with german counterparts since before world war ii .
robert lee told deutsche welle , " we 've not yet heard from this organization , but we look forward to hearing from it , and we will consider whatever it is they propose . "
perhaps a new cooperation is also long overdue .

dw 's gerhard schneibel found out why printed books hold a magic he 'll never find on a screen . the prospect of delving into the world 's greatest literature by means of an electronic device appalls me .
i do n't relish the thought of reading from a chunk of plastic any more than i look forward to eating a microwave meal at the end of a day 's work . i need ink on paper , and i doubt i 'll ever learn to be satisfied with substitutes .
furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .
basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .
it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

furthermore , i live in berlin , a city which seems to have a disproportionate number of letterpress printers faithfully plying their trade , invented in the 1400 's by johannes gutenberg . in my neighborhood alone , there are two such printers , both of whom learned their trade in communist east germany and continue to turn out printed material on dated machinery . printing as a launchpad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing requires patience and self-restraint one of them is martin z. schroeder , who works out of a few rooms at the base of an apartment building , just below street level on schonensche strasse .
he has a number of presses , including an " original heidelberg windmill " from the 1950 's .
it uses a rotating mechanism to whisk paper into place to be stamped with type . schroeder 's love for printing began at the age of 14 , when he was first exposed to the trade in the east german youth organization , the " pioneers . "
then , in 1984 , he joined the last two-year vocational course being offered in letterpress printing before more modern technology was introduced . " only a handful of us actually stayed on working as printers , " he told me .
" for most of us it was a launching pad to get into graphic design .
basically the only ones who became printers were students whose families did that . " i was mainly after one question : i wanted to know why the printed word appeals to me in ways electronic text just ca n't . schroeder emphasized that it 's the slight imperfections that make each imprint individual .
type leaves barely-perceptible indentations in the paper , and the ink dries somewhat differently each time .
the result is a final product with " more warmth " than a computer-generated print . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the technology essentially stamps ink onto paper , leaving slight imperfections " i notice that my customers always like to be able to tell that there was a human hand involved somewhere in the process ... and letterpress printing leaves behind traces of production by hand , " he said . comfort in imperfection adding to the aesthetic is the fact that letterpress printers have technically limited options in terms of what elements they can use in a design .
so while their computer-reliant counterparts might be tempted to clutter designs with garish colors , graphics and typefaces , letterpress printers must engage in a kind of minimalism .
they focus on negative space , paper quality , and subtle details like tinting the papers ' thinnest edges . the fact that graphic design and publishing are now so easily accessible to amateurs has left markets saturated with low-quality alternatives to the painstaking work schroeder offers .
still , he has noticed a resilient desire for quality work in the personal stationary , business cards , postcards , wedding stationary , bookplates and books he prints . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letterpress printing is messy , which lends it a certain charm i was certainly relieved to learn about the distinct attributes of a lovingly printed text .
it means i actually have a reason to dislike e-books - which , from what i can tell , offer only one consistent typeface throughout - and am not simply cranky years before my time . there is an incredible amount of enthusiasm afoot for the revolutionary aspects lent to reading , writing and information by technology .
but somewhere at the core of all this innovation and progress , the essential nature of humanity is still intact and just as imperfect and fundamentally stuck as it ever was .
personally , i see progress as somewhat illusory and am more comfortable with the intimacy provided by slight imperfections . gerhard schneibel lives in berlin and first learned about printing techniques from a 68-year-old newspaper editor who threatened to hit him with a pica ruler any time he got ap style wrong . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media .

some say she got off too easy , some say she can do no wrong . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case the high-profile case of german pop singer nadja benaissa , who was charged with aggravated assault for having unprotected sex while she knew she was hiv positive , has ended in a two-year suspended sentence .

german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .

nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 27.08.2010 german battle over youtube royalties wages on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube says 24 hours of video is uploaded every minute german youtube viewers have got used to the message " this video is not available in your country . "
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .

the newcomers to the bundesliga now sit atop the table early in the new football season . newly promoted kaiserslautern stunned bundesliga champions bayern munich with two goals in 60 seconds to win 2-0 on friday .
kaiserslautern now go top of the table , having earned six points from two games .
last saturday they beat cologne 3-1 .
the hosts were playing in front of a sell-out crowd of 49,780 spectators .
croatian midfielder ivo ilicevic struck a brilliant shot into the net from 20 meters in the 36th minute .
ilicevic then set up his teammate srdan lakic to score just a minute later .
" we wanted to put in a good performance and match bayern .
i think we deserved to win , " ilicevic said .
the midfielder was sent off in second half injury time after a second yellow card , but it did little to spoil kaiserslautern 's night .
bayern had a number of chances in the second half , but failed to convert them .
there are six bundesliga matches on saturday , including schalke against hanover and werder bremen versus cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .
the territory , which belgrade still regards as a serbian province , declared independence in early 2008 . author : joanna impey / richard connor -lrb- dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de westerwelle warns serbia on kosovo stance speaking in serbia , german foreign minister guido westerwelle has said the future of the balkans is as part of the eu .
he said serbia , however , would have to " come to terms " with the loss of kosovo as a province .

bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "

now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .

"
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .

the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . festivals galore it 's been nearly two and a half years since it dawned on two publishers from hamburg that the city 's harbor setting and popularity with tourists makes it the perfect place for an international literature festival .
the quickly turned their idea into reality , and the second " harbor front literature festival " is set to run this year from september 8 - 18 .
over 100 authors from more than 20 countries will read onboard ships , in the speicherstadt district filled with old marine storehouses and in the city 's famed red-light jaunt , the reeperbahn . berlin 's international literature festival is another relatively new festival celebrating its 10th anniversary this year from september 15 - 25 . not to be outdone , the ruhr valley is also hosting two more festivals for the literary-minded as part of its year as a european capital of culture .
on the docket are the international fairy tale festival from september 29 - october 3 and europe 's biggest event for fans of mysteries and thrillers , called " mord am hellweg " -lrb- " murder along the hellweg " -rrb- , from september 18 - november 13 .
star authors like hakan nesser from sweden and simon beckett from great britain will be among the participants during the festival 's eight weeks of suspense and sleuthing .
bildunterschrift : the meeting place for many : hafencity -lrb- harbor city -rrb- in hamburg beethovenfest in bonn the city of bonn is proud to be the birthplace of composer ludwig van beethoven and will host the beethovenfest once again this year , from september 10 - october 9 .
the festival can be traced all the way back to composer franz liszt , a great admirer of beethoven 's , who was frustrated by the city 's inability to collect enough money for a monument honoring the great composer .
liszt took it upon himself to collect the finances for a beethoven statue .
in 1845 , the statue was erected on bonn 's muenster square in conjunction with the city 's first beethoven festival .
since then , the celebration has had its share of highs and lows , but it is now a fixed part of bonn 's cultural scene .
this year 's motto is " into the open : freedom and utopia in music . "
bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 monuments open to the public it all started in france .
in 1984 , french politician jack lang inaugurated the " journees portes ouvertes monuments historiques " or " open house of historical monuments . "
it was an idea that quickly took hold elsewhere and became official a few years later under the title " european heritage days . "
now , 49 nations participate , and germany does its part with the annual day of the open monument .
once a year on the second sunday in september , -lrb- this year , on september 12th -rrb- , historical sites that are otherwise closed to the public open their doors .
last year , around 4.5 million people took advantage of the opportunity .
and since every occasion needs a motto , this year 's event features " culture in motion - travel , trade and traffic . "
old-fashioned trade and warehouses are on display , as well as places where other countries left their mark , like the dutch district in potsdam .
bildunterschrift : that certain dutch flair can be seen in potsdam 's dutch district modern art from latin america an advisor to bonn 's federal art and exhibition hall got a different perspective on south american life and abstract art during a visit to an exhibition in miami three years ago titled " the sites of latin american abstraction . "
he was so impressed that he proposed bringing the exhibition to germany .
his plan comes to fruition from september 17 - january 1 , 2011 , an appropriate time given that many of the countries involved are celebrating 200 years of independence .
the frankfurt book fair in october will also highlight the region by featuring argentina as a guest country .
bonn 's exhibition is titled " vibracion : modern art from latin america " and also features the work of three jewish artists who went to latin america to flee the nazi regime .
they include german photographer grete stern , german sculptor gertrude goldschmidt -lrb- gego -rrb- and swiss artist mira schendel .
bildunterschrift : impressions from latin america : this work by julio le parc is called " continuel mobile " -lrb- 1963 -rrb- knowledge on display in berlin what do math genius albert einstein , the universal scholar wilhelm leibniz and the brothers grimm have in common ?
the answer : none of them were from berlin , but all of them spent an important part of their lives in the city .
einstein completed his theory of relativity there , leibniz acted as the first president of the prussian academy of sciences , and the brothers grimm wrote their " history of the german language " in berlin .
their original works will be displayed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin , starting this month .
" world knowledge - 300 years of the sciences in berlin " from september 24 - january 9 , 2011 is the exhibition 's title and takes place as part of berlin 's year of science .
five of the city 's major scientific centers - the berlin state library , the charite university hospital , the berlin-brandenburg academy of sciences and humanities , humboldt university and the max planck society - are taking part and providing some of the approximately 1,600 items that will be displayed .
those objects include manuscripts , books , mounted animals , tools and a replica of an enormous precursor to the calculator called the z3 .
it was created by konrad zuse and presented in 1941 for the first time to a group of scientists and scholars .
bildunterschrift : have fun trying to decode this selection from astronomer christfried kirch 's observation journal -lrb- 1717-1720 -rrb- oktoberfest in munich it may be called oktoberfest , but it actually starts in september !
from september 18 - october 3 , millions of people will head to the bavarian capital to drink beer , enjoy regional dishes and then drink more beer of course .
most visitors will wear bavaria 's traditional attire , regardless of whether they 're from munich , australia or japan .
oktoberfest is n't just the world 's biggest beer festival ; it can also be traced back to a centuries-old tradition - to be exact , to a horse race in october 1810 that marked the marriage of then crown prince ludwig i. the celebration was so much fun that it was repeated the following year and beyond .
oktoberfest was born .
those who plan to come may want to get their arms in shape , though .
the beer is n't served in normal glasses but in extra-large steins that hold up to a liter .
bottoms up !
bildunterschrift : cheers !

a report on the democratic voice of burma website said that than shwe and maung aye were preparing to take over the top two posts of president and vice president of the pro junta union solidarity and development party , the usdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro democracy leader aung san suu kyi senior general to remain the head of state it is expected that than shwe will retain his status as head of state until the elections in november .
earlier this year , 27 military officials resigned from their posts to take up jobs as government ministers . critics have dismissed elections in myanmar as a political stunt to reinforce the power of the military .
the country last held elections in 1990 , when nobel laureate aung san suu kyi won by a landslide but was denied the chance to rule .
suu kyi has also been denied the right to contest elections after being arrested earlier this year . suu kyi 's national league for democracy has decided to boycott the elections , calling them unfair .
the junta has disbanded the party .
nearly 42 parties have registered to contest the elections in november . mg / afp / reuters editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .

for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request .

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media . " internet platforms like youtube are the current and future way for musicians to reach their fans to promote their work , or even have their break through into business , " he told deutsche welle . a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pop star justin bieber was discovered on youtube by failing to give a definite judgment on youtube 's copyright policy , the court 's decision leaves the door open for further litigation between gema and you tube .

german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

suu kyi has also been denied the right to contest elections after being arrested earlier this year . suu kyi 's national league for democracy has decided to boycott the elections , calling them unfair .

a un committee has urged france to do more to integrate roma in french society . france insisted on friday that it is " scrupulously respecting european law " and its " international commitments , " rebuffing criticism from the united nations that its current policy with regards to roma gypsies could amount to " collective repatriation . " " european law foresees two limits on residency rights , respect for public order and possession of sufficient resources to not impose an excessive burden on the host country 's social welfare system , " a statement from the foreign ministry stated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president sarkozy 's tough law and order rhetoric helped him get elected in 2007 the un committee for the elimination of racial discrimination -lrb- cerd -rrb- have voiced concern at france 's move to dismantle 300 illegal roma camps and send thousands of roma to romania and bulgaria . " our concern is that the removal or return of the roma has been done on a collective basis rather than examining their individual circumstances so it gives the appearance that a group has been identified rather than individuals , " said pierre-richard prosper , who headed the 18-expert panel 's review of france 's actions . the un committee said france is violating a 1969 treaty that prohibits barriers based on race , color , descent or national or ethnic origin . " racist and xenophobic discourse " french minister for european affairs pierre lellouche defended france 's policies of deporting roma and banning the full-face islamic veil . " this report ... distinguishes itself by its excessive and caricatured character and by its numerous factual errors , " lellouche told an audience of french ambassadors meeting at their annual conference in paris . he added that the measures were all intended to protect " the most important human right , that of security .

" french and european commission officials said friday that they will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the paris ' integration policies .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding had criticized france saying she was following " with great attention and some concern " its controversial decision to repatriate hundreds of non-registered ethnic roma to romania and bulgaria . author : nicole goebel -lrb- afp / reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior army official the move would change their status to civilians and enable them to take part in the upcoming elections in myanmar , also known as burma . polls in myanmar are scheduled for november 7 this year .
the top three military leaders , than shwe , muang aye and thura shwe man , are reportedly to be replaced by junior officers .

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .

he also urged bosnians to stand united to boost their chances of eu membership . german foreign minister guido westerwelle has reinforced germany 's stance on kosovo 's independence on the last leg of his balkan tour in pristina on friday , calling on all eu states to accept the status of the former serbian province , which serbia still regards as part of its territory . " there is concern in several countries ... that the recognition of kosovo could mean something for other conflicts in other states , " westerwelle said .
" this is not the case . " kosovo has been recognized as an independent state by 69 countries , including 22 in the eu .
cyprus , spain , greece , slovakia and romania - all of which are grappling with rebellious domestic groups - have refused to accept its independence . " the recognition of kosovo is a case of sui generis , " westerwelle said " twenty-two states have decided as germany did .
five others are hesitating .
i ask them after the clear decision of the court : follow the majority in the european union . " court ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 westerwelle was referring to the july ruling of the international court of justice -lrb- icj -rrb- that declared kosovo 's independence in line with international law . westerwelle also discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .

" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !

it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .

nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .

german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request .

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media . " internet platforms like youtube are the current and future way for musicians to reach their fans to promote their work , or even have their break through into business , " he told deutsche welle . a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pop star justin bieber was discovered on youtube by failing to give a definite judgment on youtube 's copyright policy , the court 's decision leaves the door open for further litigation between gema and you tube .
but youtube is hoping it wo n't come to that . " this is a goal that ca n't be achieved through a judicial process , " dorstewitz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 27.08.2010 new veterans ' association reassesses german army 's role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say soldiers ' interests are not adequately represented the german army now has its own veterans ' association .
the organization adds a new element to the debate about the position of the bundeswehr in german society , and hopes to rehabilitate the war veterans . the bund deutscher veteranen -lrb- association of german veterans -rrb- came into existence last saturday .
using the occasion of the german government 's official open day , it set up a stand in the defense ministry and introduced itself to the public .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg spent some time at the stand , and spoke to several german veterans representing the nascent organization .
once its establishment has been officially sealed , the bdv intends to apply for financial support from the government .
its founder is lieutenant-colonel andreas timmermann-levanas , veteran of the german military missions in afghanistan and bosnia .
timmermann-levanas also founded deutsche kriegsopferfürsorge -lrb- german war victims ' welfare -rrb- , an organization that cares for soldiers who return from missions with physical or psychological injuries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg spoke to veterans at the government open day unwounded but unheard the bdv grew out of the growing number not represented by that organization .
timmermann-levanas told deutsche welle , " the demand kept coming , ' what about the ones who were n't wounded ? '
we have to care for those too .
we have to give them a voice .
for those , the current institutions were not enough . "
timmermann-levanas could not say exactly how many membership applications have already come in to the bdv , as it is still officially in the process of being established , but he said there were " very many " people interested .
indeed , the potential community for the bdv is surprisingly large .
since 1955 , when the post-war german army was established under its new name the bundeswehr , -lrb- replacing the world war ii-era wehrmacht -rrb- 280,000 german soldiers have been on international missions , either in wars , in ' war-like conflicts , ' as german politicians sometimes refer to afghanistan , or on purely humanitarian missions .
but anyone over 18 , german or not , who agrees with the association 's aims can become a member .
there are important caveats , of course : " we do n't want to be instrumentalized by any far-right groups , or any political groups for that matter , " says timmermann-levanas .
rehabilitating the veteran germany 's history puts any organization related to the military in the middle of a tortuous and unending debate .
the bdv is hoping to avoid this by placing the emphasis on representing the post-war army , but in doing so , it wants society to rethink its whole attitude the veteran .
" i think we can contribute to making society discuss what exactly a veteran is , " timmermann-levanas argues .
" in germany we have associated the veteran with something negative for the last 60 years - understandably in view of the history .
if you think of the old veteran 's associations from the second world war , if you think of the wehrmacht , then you 're right back into the discussion about tradition - is the german army itself good or bad ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr will never be entirely free of the shadow of the wehrmacht the bdv wants to take its cue from veterans ' associations that were established in the us after the vietnam war , when returning soldiers were vilified and ostracized by a public that condemned them .
this is a circumstance unknown elsewhere .
robert lee , spokesman for the royal british legion , a welfare organization responsible for serving the interests of british military personnel and their families , says uk public opinion about the army makes no distinction between world war ii and post-war soldiers .
" the needs of the post-war service community is a large part of what we do , given the amount of time that has passed since 1945 and the number of conflicts the uk has been involved with since 1945 , " lee said .
" in this country there is a very active program of public recognition for sacrifices made in all conflicts , including the ongoing conflict in afghanistan . "
distinguishing the military from politics but as opposed to the us , where " support the troops , not the war " campaigns have become common , in germany there has never been a groundswell of support for soldiers independent of the government 's military policy .
this is precisely what the bdv is aiming for .
" we are simply calling for respect and recognition for what these people did for the german state , independent of whether you approve politically of this or that specific mission , " timmermann-levanas said .
but most reactions to the founding of the association have been positive .
comments on internet forums have mainly said that such an organization is long overdue .
in fact , there have been german veterans ' associations since the napoleonic wars , but the bdv has a very specific notion of its responsibilities .
" we do n't want to be associated with some misunderstood concept of military pride , " says timmermann-levanas .
" i believe the german army has a tradition since 1955 that we can be proud of .
we do n't know want to go back and honor certain battles or only accept people who have won military honors . "
overdue reconciliation timmermann-levanas was also hopeful that cooperation would be organized with veterans ' associations abroad , and contact has already been established with equivalent organizations in the us and the netherlands .
there has been no contact with the royal british legion yet .
since there were no german veterans ' organizations until now , the legion has not organized exchange or ' reconciliation ' trips with german counterparts since before world war ii .
robert lee told deutsche welle , " we 've not yet heard from this organization , but we look forward to hearing from it , and we will consider whatever it is they propose . "
perhaps a new cooperation is also long overdue .

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .
" bosnia-herzegovina only has one european future , not several . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia remains divided , years after the war since the 1995 dayton peace accord , which ended the country 's three-year civil war , the two entities have had their own administrations linked by a weak central government .
bosnian serb prime minister milorad dodik said this week that he believed the bosnian serbs would eventually secede . westerwelle warned against such a move , saying that the balkan country should press ahead with political and economic reforms after elections on october 3 . more power for center the german foreign minister said it was important to give more power to its central government , limiting the power of individual groups to derail progress . " i want to stress clearly that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia-herzegovina must not be questioned , " westerwelle said .
" constitutional reform should allow for limiting ethnic groups in their potential to prevent state-level decision making .
federalism has to be more functional . " later on friday , westerwelle was due to visit kosovo on the last leg of his three-day tour of the balkans .
the main topic on the agenda was to be the dispute between kosovo and serbia .
serbia refuses to recognize the independence of its former province , unlike most other european countries . westerwelle discussed the matter with serbian leaders during his visit to belgrade on thursday .
he stressed that a dialogue with kosovo is one of the prerequisites for serbia becoming a member of the european union . kosovo itself is seen as being long way from european union membership .
among its problems is continuing ethnic tensions . no end in sight for nato deployment two years after kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , around 10,000 nato peacekeepers remain in the former serbian province .
germany provides the peacekeeping force 's largest contingent with 1,400 troops in kosovo . on friday , westerwelle is to visit the gracanica monastery near pristina , where german troops are at work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle met with serbian leaders in belgrade ahead of westerwelle 's visit , the commander of the peacekeeping mission known as kfor , german lieutenant general markus bentler , spoke about the role of his soldiers . " people all know how important these religious and cultural heritage sites are , " bentler said .
" we are the ones who 've protected them for 11 years . " gracanica is one of the areas where nato troops are gradually handing over control to kosovar police .
bentler said although an end to the nato deployment in kosovo is not yet in sight , the transfer of responsibility is an important process . " it 's a sign that institutions in kosovo are mature enough and that the kosovar police is doing good professional work , " he said . nato forces have been in kosovo since a 1999 nato bombing campaign forced yugoslav forces to withdraw from the territory , ending a bloody inter-ethnic conflict . the population of kosovo is 90 percent albanian .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.08.2010 one month on , italian autonomous vehicle continues its trek to china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the autonomous vehicle is expected to enter siberia within the next month italian scientists have pioneered a robotic van that can navigate streets on its own .
the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trip has been largely smooth so far , save a little incident in moscow , the project 's leader says . in july , an italian company , vislab , began a three-month journey from parma , italy to shanghai , china .
but it was n't just any road trip .
their odyssey involves their autonomous vehicle , a bright orange van that drives itself along city streets and small highways .
" the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge " is the longest and most difficult test of autonomous vehicles to date .
previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously , many of the research team members had competed in a related autonomous driving competition held in california , which had been sponsored by the united states department of defense .
deutsche welle spoke with the leader of vislab , alberto broggi , who leads the project and is a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma .
deutsche welle : how many weeks has it been now that your van has been out on the road ? alberto broggi : we have been there for four weeks now , exactly one month .
we 've been traveling for roughly 2,500 kilometers -lsb- about 1,500 miles -rsb- . how has it been going so far ?
i 've seen that there have been some bureaucratic problems .
has it gone as you expected ? so far it 's been kind of smooth .
we 've had some little problems with bureaucracy , and a little bit with the technology , but mainly bureaucracy .
the vision system has been working nicely .
we have learned some things about our minor problems when we had our little accident . it was at the end of one day , people were done for the day , they switched off everything except the autonomous driver , which was on , and the vehicle started moving and it crashed into the vehicle in front .
it was a very slow crash because they were very close , they were only four meters apart .
the speed was not high , but we learned that the design of the autonomous driver has to be improved .
and actually we have to improve some kind of visual warning related to the presence of some system in the " on " position .
so whenever there is something that is on , we should be warned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto broggi -lrb- left -rrb- will meet up with his team at the end of september so it hit another car in public , or it hit another van in your caravan ? it hit one of our vans , and it was on the side of the road .
we were parked .
everybody was sitting there beside the vehicles and talking , and nobody was taking care of the vehicles .
nobody had the emergency stop , and then one started moving .
we now have a little dent of the vehicle in front , and i 'm sure that we will not fix it ; it 's now part of our history , and part of our trip . for those of our readers who did n't see the first interview that i did with you , can you remind us just a little bit about how this works .
you have two vans , and one is following the other autonomously , right ? exactly .
the first one is driven by a human , and the second one follows .
the second one looks for the first vehicle .
if the first vehicle is visible , then the second vehicle will follow it .
if the first vehicle is n't visible , then the second vehicle will just follow the gps information that the first vehicle is sending back .
so the second vehicle is just using its local sensing to determine the best position on the road , and to determine the maneuver . and that was one of the problems that we had when we entered moscow .
so when we entered moscow , the second vehicle was following the first vehicle and that was fine .
but then someone cut in between the two vehicles , and this is something that normally happens , so it was nothing to worry about .
but in that particular case , the other traffic was so chaotic , it was so crowded that no one was respecting the rules .
we were in a two-lane road , but there were three or four cars in a row .
so lane markings were just forgotten by the vehicles .
everybody was over the lane markings .
our vehicle on the other hand was following the rules and was trying to find the lane markings and stay between them .
that means that our behavioral model was different than the rest of the traffic .
so we had to turn back to manual mode . when you say manual mode , you mean being driven by a human ? yes , you can take over whenever you want .
in that case , the people on the vehicle thought it was safer to stop the autonomous driving and drive manually .
because our vehicle was driving to stay in the middle of the lane and the other traffic was not . that 's very interesting .
have there been a lot of moments like that , where you 've had to intervene ?
does this kind of thing happen a lot ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire trip is 13,000 kilometers from parma to shanghai not really .
this happened in moscow because it was very crowded and the other traffic was not respecting the rules , and it happened when we had to pay the toll station .
we were reaching a toll station .
the second vehicle does n't know that you have to stop and pay .
that 's another nice story to tell about - we now know that these toll stations exist .
there were some glitches that pushed us to go back to manual .
yesterday we had a fault in our speedometer , it was not working .
it was giving 100 kph , but we were driving at 50 kph , so we had to go back to manual .
it was a fault in our system . there have been a few situations like this , but nothing as important as when we entered moscow .
we really learned that you really ca n't rely on a single driving mode , like we have now .
we need to adapt to the local traffic , and we need to learn how local traffic moves .
and if people do not respect the rules and do not respect the lane markings , then we should n't either . we 're speaking on thursday , august 26 .
where is the vehicle right now ?
they are in saratov , which is about 500 kilometers southeast of moscow .
they left moscow five or six days ago and they are traveling and today they are stopped for a presentation and a demonstration .
the next stop will be kazan on september 1st . since the van left italy , you have n't seen it , right ? no , i 'm still here in parma . does your team check in with you every day ?
are you following it online ?
how are you connected to what 's happening on the road ? every three or four hours , we get a phone call and people tell me how they 're working and the problems they have - not only myself but the team here in parma .
we have a team here working with them in russia . -lsb- … -rsb- we will send new hardware on september 1 , when there will be the next switch of people there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vislab plans on reaching shanghai by the end of october can you give us a preview of what you expect to happen in the next month ? the most important change will be weather , because right now we 've been traveling in sunny , hot weather .
we 're going to be going in areas where the weather will be bad and this will threaten our systems .
i 'm thinking about siberia as one of the most difficult areas .
the roads will be unpaved ; there will be big holes on the roads and dust .
it will be raining a lot and the weather will be bad .
this is the biggest problem that we might have . the vehicle will go towards novosibirsk , in siberia , about 3,000 kilometers east of moscow , and then down south to kazakhstan and then east towards shanghai . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a recent court decision showed that the battle over music streaming in germany is far from over . youtube won a small victory in hamburg court on friday when a judge decided not to grant an injunction against the video-sharing platform .
gema , the german artists ' representation agency , had sued youtube for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters . gema may have lost this battle , but the lawsuit between the berlin-based royalty organization and youtube was n't really about blocking videos - it was about getting payment for them .
the two sides have been trying for over a year to renegotiate a license that expired in march 2009 . " we just want youtube to pay for the videos it uses , " gema spokeswoman bettina mueller told deutsche welle .
" that 's the goal .
we 're not trying to hurt youtube users or copyright holders . " destined for failure a discrepancy in the payment expectations is one of the reasons negotiations failed .
gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media . " internet platforms like youtube are the current and future way for musicians to reach their fans to promote their work , or even have their break through into business , " he told deutsche welle . a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pop star justin bieber was discovered on youtube by failing to give a definite judgment on youtube 's copyright policy , the court 's decision leaves the door open for further litigation between gema and you tube .

gema is accustomed to the traditional method of royalty collection , where a user pays every time copyrighted material is broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gema represents over 60,000 composers and songwriters but youtube does n't see itself as a traditional broadcaster .
the site does n't charge users to watch videos and generates revenue though advertising .
what 's more , anyone can upload a video to youtube at anytime .
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users . gema said the company should be obligated to ensure that the person uploading the video has the legal right to do so . " youtube knows which videos are on its platform , " mueller said .
" the software for tracking that exists . " youtube 's spokesperson , henning dorstewitz , said the company has blocked countless videos at gema 's request . " if a person who holds a copyright discovers a video on youtube that violates his copyright , he only has to give us the url of the video , and we will block it , " dorstewitz said . a strong signal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube was bought by internet giant google in 2006 many of the youtube videos currently blocked in germany are the result of agreements with record labels and have nothing to do with gema , whose clients are songwriters and composers . gema 's move block its own clients ' material on youtube was a risky one .
an internet presence is a critical marketing tool for modern artists , according to mario rehse of bitkom , germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media . " internet platforms like youtube are the current and future way for musicians to reach their fans to promote their work , or even have their break through into business , " he told deutsche welle . a long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pop star justin bieber was discovered on youtube by failing to give a definite judgment on youtube 's copyright policy , the court 's decision leaves the door open for further litigation between gema and you tube .
but youtube is hoping it wo n't come to that . " this is a goal that ca n't be achieved through a judicial process , " dorstewitz said .

german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .

many are camping on the outskirts of the city .
they have to rely on help from aid agencies , private individuals and political parties .
but anyone who has lost his identity card will not get a place in the camp .
" we have our own mechanism to identify people affected by the flood , " explains shah . imran shah says identification is important because of professional beggars or some other people , who want to benefit from state services .
he does n't say how long the camp will remain there .
the extent of the flood is so huge that the consequences too will be massive .
even if the flood waters recede many people will remain dependent on help for a long time .

amnesty international said it was alarmed about the stigmatization of the roma . around 300 roma departed from airports in paris and lyon on thursday in the latest wave of what the french government calls a voluntary repatriation scheme .
the flights bring the total number of roma expelled from france this year to more than 8,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a makeshift roma camp was dismantled in the city of lille french police also dismantled a campsite in lille as part of president nicolas sarkozy 's major crackdown on crime that began earlier this month .
police have targeted the roma community , along with other itinerant groups .
the crackdown has sparked major criticism at home and abroad .
former french prime minister dominique de villepin said sarkozy 's policies had left a " stain of shame " on the french flag and were a " national indignity . "
growing international condemnation human rights organization amnesty international said sarkozy risked stigmatizing the minority group .
" french officials should be working to fight discrimination , rather than making inflammatory statements linking entire communities to alleged criminality , " the organization said in a statement .
amnesty is alarmed that the rhetoric " could perpetuate negative stereotypes which contribute to the stigmatization of and discrimination against roma and travelers . "
earlier this month a united nations panel warned of mounting racism and xenophobia in france , citing the roma evictions .
the european union 's justice commissioner is currently reviewing whether the crackdown is legal .
opinion polls show support for the crackdown the french government insists it is simply clamping down on illegal immigration and trying to protect its citizens from crime , saying roma camps are sources of people-trafficking and prostitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international joined critics of sarkozy 's crackdown opinion polls in france showed solid public support for the expulsions , despite the widespread criticism .
a survey published in le figaro said 69 percent of people questioned supported the dismantling of the roma camps , and 65 percent backed the deportations .
more than 10 million roma live in the eu , roughly a fifth of them in romania .
in france there are estimated to be about 15,000 roma of romanian and bulgarian extraction .
ministers say most of the deported roma leave france voluntarily after accepting a payment of 300 euros -lrb- 382 dollars -rrb- per adult and 100 euros per child .

despite its central government , the country remains deeply divided . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on friday that bosnia-herzegovina only had a future within the eu if it first resolved its internal divisions . on the third and final day of his tour of the former yugoslavia , westerwelle said that the state - divided between the muslim-croat federation and the mainly serb republika srpska - would only progress to eu member status as a united country . " bosnia-herzegovina clearly has a future in europe but the road to europe is only through internal unity , through internal unification , " westerwelle told a news conference in sarajevo after talks with bosnian counterpart sven alkalaj .

some say she got off too easy , some say she can do no wrong . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say she got off too easy , some say she can do no wrong . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
german pop star gets suspended sentence in hiv case i think nadja got off easy by only getting two years probation .
i think she should have gotten the full ten years as already allowed under the german statute . - paul , us man with hiv infection = death sentence .
" celebrity " -lrb- ahem -rrb- charged with aggravated assault = 300 hours community service and two years - suspended !
i would like to compliment the presiding judge for the best laugh i 've had today !
it 's good to know that the english legal system is n't the only one with nepotism at its core . - reginal , great britain holding people who carry forth such acts of negligence accountable is of the utmost importance .
how dare she or anyone else have unprotected sex knowing they are contaminated with the hiv virus ?
it 's another reason why we can not trust people with our body temples .
no doubt the hiv person is going through a lot of emotional , mental , and spiritual trauma .
yet , if that were the excuse given by a political or financial leader concerning our present global economic crisis due to any negligence on their part ; we would have the leader indicted , impeached , and / or imprisoned .
so money is more important than good health . - darrell , us in my opinion , it should be a crime as you are endangering the lives of your partners and also contributing to the spread of the disease .
it is also selfish on your part to seek pleasure at other 's peoples ' expense .
a mature person is responsible for his or her actions and thus should think of the greater majority . - tracy , philippines i wonder why nadja 's partner was not using a condom ?
nadja was not the only one to blame , in my opinion . i 'll love nadja forever , she is good star . - ibrahim , libya in my humble opinion , sexual relations should be in a different category to confectionary .
both are consumed for pleasure .
that is fine .
but if you lace the confection with arsenic you will kill someone .
unless something is done , people will regard sex as harmless confectionary .
when hiv appeared in the early 80 's it was straightaway clear that it was an unpleasant fatal infection .
well now it can be held in control by taking multi-drug therapy for life - so what ?
it is still serious and unpleasant .
when people have sex they must be aware they can transmit revolting fatal diseases .
is that new ?
no , because the same has been so since endemic syphilis appeared in the 1500s .
sex is not like eating chocolate .
given the long history of sexually transmitted disease , it seems unwise , all of a sudden , to become slack in punishing those who spread them among us .
jail them . - fred , australia the media should report everything about celebrities because they have chosen to be in the limelight , and hence if their privacy was so important to them they should have remained away from publicity and limelight .
but that is not the real issue .
the issue is that in western culture , sex has been commercialized , women have been turned into a commodity , and sex is accepted as an act of pleasure only with no strings attached or moral values transgressed .
hence the man who acquired the virus from the singer reaped for what he had sowed .
this rot is so deep that there is no redress in sight . - kannaiya , india compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two weeks of competition is the brainchild of the ioc 's president , jacques rogge , and involves around 3,600 young athletes from around the world .
school reporters from singapore provide on-the-spot updates and reflect on life in the host city during the exciting event .
by grade 8 students , aged 13-14 from the united world college of south east asia , singapore two stunning weeks of the first-ever youth olympic games have finally come to an end , leaving us with many moments to savor .
action-packed events have entertained global audiences and all the athletes have given their best .
the games opened on the glorious evening of 14th august ; crowds cheered and applauded wildly as magnificent fireworks erupted into the night and beautiful dances were performed .
achievements abounded and all participants left proud of their involvement .
there are many interesting tales told from the games .
3,600 14- to 18-year olds from all over the world competed in singapore day four was a particularly special one for singapore as swimmer rainer ng received the host country 's first gold medal .
on day five birthday boy zhenye xie found another reason to celebrate as he sped past hard challenger , keisuke homma , in the boys 200m sprint .
day six saw a joint victory for france and china as swimmers anna santamons and tang yi touched the wall at the same time .
who says gold can not be shared ?
caio dos santos made brazil proud on day eight , snatching his victory from the clutches of matsubara sho -lrb- japan -rrb- by 0.4m in the thrilling long jump .
jamaican odane skeen vowed that he is the one to beat on the track and he stayed true to his word after an emotional victory in the 100m , whereupon he was crowned " sprint king " .
will he be the next usain bolt ?
an exciting table tennis final followed , taking place between chinese taipei and japan .
it ended in a beaming victory for the japanese paddler , koki niwa .
finally , day 12 's volleyball finals had the crowd on the edge of their seats as both cuba and argentina played extremely well .
we think everyone will agree that the youth olympic games has certainly brought a lot of excitement to this little island and has firmly placed singapore on the international map !
day 13 - fri 27 august : reporters ethan and julie last night 's ceremony was one of absolute fun and it was great that the first ever youth olympics ended with an amazing show .
having the competition taking place here in singapore was really exhilarating and all that excitement was built up for last night 's celebration !
the show started with musical performances and dances done in multiple styles simultaneously .
it was remarkable to see the performances done in such a large scale .
then all the athletes walked on stage in a unique manner - instead of having each nation 's participants march on by country , the youth olympians simply swarmed on to the stage !
they seemed to be having the time of their lives and with almost no national divide it was clear that we should all try to work together and our differences need to be put aside .
finally , once all 3,600 athletes were on stage , the olympic flame was extinguished .
the flame was finally extinguished to mark the end of the youth olympic games even though this olympics has ended one commentator insightfully said : " the extinguishing of the flame is only the beginning " we believe the youth olympics games sends an important message to the world : the youth competing are the generation that will shape the future .
and it is exciting for us that we are part of that generation too !
day 12 - thurs 26 august : reporter fionnuala today was a sad yet exciting day for the youth olympic games in singapore ; sad because the games are coming to an end but exciting at the same time because the events are in their final rounds .
one of the most dramatic events was the volleyball final , which was held in toa poyah sports hall .
the cuban boys volleyball team were playing against argentina for the gold medal .
there was a fantastic turnout and everyone in the crowd was on the edge of their seats .
cuba 's wilfredo leon , known as the lion king , celebrates after scoring 35 of the 92 points in the final both teams have worked hard in their previous games , so it was well deserved that cuba and argentina were in the final .
people were anxious to know the end result !
argentina began with an astonishing start but in the end cuba defeated argentina by 3-1 .
the cuban team 's captain , alexis lamadrid said " the gold medal is the result of all of the training and hard work we have put in " .
day 11 - wed 25 august : reporters danny and karan it was another spectacular day in the 2010 youth olympic games .
the crowd was especially amazing at the boxing bronze medal bout where hungary 's " rocky balboa " zoltan harcsa defeated nigeria 's muideen akanji .
he finished 8-1 to secure the bronze medal .
even after being defeated in the semi-finals by damien hooper , harcsa gave it all he got to win the bronze medal fight - he really showed the world his spirit !
we still think monday 's table tennis final was also phenomenal to watch .
the battle was between the young asian giants of the sport , hung tzu-hsiang from chinese taipei and koki niwa from japan .
chinese taipei 's hung tzu-hsiang securing the first game 11-9 and there were massive cheers for the underdog .
but the japanese yokohama champion was determined to win .
eventually the japanese paddler koki niwa emerged victorious with a score of 9-11 , 11-8 , 13-11 , 13-15 , 11-7 and 15-13 .
it was a truly amazing match between the two players and shows how much talent competitors at the youth olympic games have .
day 10 - tues 24 august : reporters gabriella and mimi day 10 has proved to be very exciting with thirteen events being held including athletics , cycling , table tennis and archery , and medals events for boxing , diving and the individual equestrian finals .
at the turf club riding centre , the crowd was buzzing with excitement .
the two rounds of show jumping ended with places tied for both first and third and so there was a jump-off with six riders competing for bronze and two riders competing for gold .
the show jumping competition had an exciting jump-off to decide the medals dalma malhas , from the kingdom of saudi arabia , made history as the first saudi female equestrian competitor .
she raced over the jumps at an amazing speed and came third winning bronze on flash top hat in 38.05 seconds .
marcelo chirico from uruguay won gold on links hot gossip , with a clear round in only 42.35 seconds .
mario gamboa from columbia went home with silver .
the winners left the arena after cantering around waving their hats in the air to loud applause .
the only sadness was that both carian scudamore from great britain and valentina isoardi from italy , who both won gold medals in the team event , had to pull out of the individual competition as their horses were lame .
another amazing event today was the table tennis mixed doubles preliminary .
it started at 10am and was held at the indoor stadium .
lots of local students from singapore were very loud spectators and it created a great atmosphere - it was amazing to actually be there !
we were particularly supporting alice loveridge from guernsey who was playing for great britain and her partner leonardo mutti .
team gb competitor alice loveridge came 17th overall in the singles alice and leo were competing in a group of four and although they lost two of their three games in the first stage they will play again tomorrow .
at the end of the day we interviewed alice about how if felt to compete at the first-ever youth olympic games .
she said : " compared to all the other international competitions the atmosphere is great and i have much more support from home .
singapore is also a very nice place and amazingly clean . "
we also asked alice about the difference between playing singles and doubles matches .
she said : " the doubles is more challenging because your partner is relying on you . "
after talking to her you could really tell she has had a great time .
it seems the youth olympic games has been an amazing experience for everyone .
day 9 - mon 23 august : reporters viraaj and jack it was yet another exciting day in the youth olympic games but we were sad to see that it was the last day of the athletic events , especially as this is such a popular crowd pleaser .
we were also disappointed to see rain today , but this was no surprise to the singaporians who are used to the tropical climate - we are just one degree north of the equator so it rains torrentially here !
the girls ' hammer throw was the first event of the day .
the rain made it quite difficult for the competitors by making the field slippery .
and in the boy 's competition the audience were surprised to see the favourite sebastian dobkowski from poland not receive a medal .
instead china 's lui binbin took home the gold in that event .
on the track the kenyans carried on their tradition of winning the steeplechase - good for them !
odane skeen celebrates his successes in the sprint races finally , the relay events were very interesting because the teams were organised by continents rather than countries .
odane skeen from jamaica won his second gold medal of the tournament by winning the track and field event for the america 's .
on saturday he won the 100m final .
it was thrilling to watch him , and like many others , we wonder if perhaps he is the next usain bolt !
so , despite the rain-related-problems we are proud to see such sporting excellence displayed in our country .
day 8 - sun 22 august : reporters merlin and shresht it was another spectacular day in the incredible two weeks that is the 2010 youth olympics !
the ambience was especially amazing during the two and a half hours of the junior men 's cycling road-race final .
a lot of the riders had interesting strategies , such as jay mccarthy who decided to bridge a 40 second gap breakaway all by himself on the last five laps .
it was an incredible thing that he did and the audience gave him much applause .
mccarthy eventually ended up in 19th place and the gold-medal winner was rafael ferreira reis from portugal .
australian diver hannah thek impressed the crowds today 's diving finals were also very dramatic .
the girls winner was china 's lui jiao with a total score of 479.60 but australian hannah thek did some amazing moves and her more technical stunts got much applause from the crowd .
she was unlucky to score only five 's and six 's throughout the day but her efforts were tremendous and it showed .
finally , the canoeing and kayaking competitions deserve a special mention as the audience absolutely loved the obvious tension in these events .
jessica fox was the first aussie on the water this morning in an event that was new to her , but she still ended up eighth in the qualifying out of 24 .
it was an exciting competition to watch - it is phenomenal to see people so young with so much talent and for kids from all over the world to come to singapore showcase their talents to the world .
the youth olympics is a truly spectacular event .
we still ca n't believe it is right on our doorstep !
day 7 - sat 21 august : reporters aayesha and aanchal against the majestic background of benjamin sheares bridge , the canoe-kayak event was held with participants from 24 countries today .
we went along to watch this event and so saw for ourselves the contestants showcasing impressive manoeuvring skills and speed .
queiroz from brazil being the fastest in the canoe sprint and hungary held the best times for both the men and women 's kayaking .
queiroz from brazil was fastest in the canoe sprint competition of the other medal events that took place today , the men 's archery final was probably the most tense .
the audience waited anxiously as each finalist held their bow with immense concentration .
ibrahim sabry of egypt outshone his opponent in each round with his consistent accurate shots , resulting in him receiving egypt 's first gold medal .
but the most vibrant audience by far was for the popular gymnastics event , especially when 15 year old viktoria komova from russia received her second and third gold medals !
the competition and pressure were running high for each competitor and the diverse audience cheered loudly in support of their different countries .
with so many different sports and countries involved the youth olympic games is a wonderful event !
day 6 - fri 20 august : reporters rico and gene today a total of eight different sports took place at the singapore youth olympic games , including gymnastics , handball , sailing and swimming .
but in our opinion , the swimming events were by far the most exciting .
we tuned in to watch the rising tension at the singapore sports school where the final swimming events were held .
there were still some singapore swimmers competing and all were looking to grab another medal - we were , of course , rooting for them !

school reporters from singapore provide on-the-spot updates and reflect on life in the host city during the exciting event .
by grade 8 students , aged 13-14 from the united world college of south east asia , singapore two stunning weeks of the first-ever youth olympic games have finally come to an end , leaving us with many moments to savor .
action-packed events have entertained global audiences and all the athletes have given their best .
the games opened on the glorious evening of 14th august ; crowds cheered and applauded wildly as magnificent fireworks erupted into the night and beautiful dances were performed .
achievements abounded and all participants left proud of their involvement .

finally , day 12 's volleyball finals had the crowd on the edge of their seats as both cuba and argentina played extremely well .
we think everyone will agree that the youth olympic games has certainly brought a lot of excitement to this little island and has firmly placed singapore on the international map !
day 13 - fri 27 august : reporters ethan and julie last night 's ceremony was one of absolute fun and it was great that the first ever youth olympics ended with an amazing show .
having the competition taking place here in singapore was really exhilarating and all that excitement was built up for last night 's celebration !
the show started with musical performances and dances done in multiple styles simultaneously .
it was remarkable to see the performances done in such a large scale .
then all the athletes walked on stage in a unique manner - instead of having each nation 's participants march on by country , the youth olympians simply swarmed on to the stage !
they seemed to be having the time of their lives and with almost no national divide it was clear that we should all try to work together and our differences need to be put aside .
finally , once all 3,600 athletes were on stage , the olympic flame was extinguished .
the flame was finally extinguished to mark the end of the youth olympic games even though this olympics has ended one commentator insightfully said : " the extinguishing of the flame is only the beginning " we believe the youth olympics games sends an important message to the world : the youth competing are the generation that will shape the future .
and it is exciting for us that we are part of that generation too !
day 12 - thurs 26 august : reporter fionnuala today was a sad yet exciting day for the youth olympic games in singapore ; sad because the games are coming to an end but exciting at the same time because the events are in their final rounds .
one of the most dramatic events was the volleyball final , which was held in toa poyah sports hall .
the cuban boys volleyball team were playing against argentina for the gold medal .
there was a fantastic turnout and everyone in the crowd was on the edge of their seats .
cuba 's wilfredo leon , known as the lion king , celebrates after scoring 35 of the 92 points in the final both teams have worked hard in their previous games , so it was well deserved that cuba and argentina were in the final .
people were anxious to know the end result !
argentina began with an astonishing start but in the end cuba defeated argentina by 3-1 .
the cuban team 's captain , alexis lamadrid said " the gold medal is the result of all of the training and hard work we have put in " .
day 11 - wed 25 august : reporters danny and karan it was another spectacular day in the 2010 youth olympic games .
the crowd was especially amazing at the boxing bronze medal bout where hungary 's " rocky balboa " zoltan harcsa defeated nigeria 's muideen akanji .
he finished 8-1 to secure the bronze medal .
even after being defeated in the semi-finals by damien hooper , harcsa gave it all he got to win the bronze medal fight - he really showed the world his spirit !
we still think monday 's table tennis final was also phenomenal to watch .
the battle was between the young asian giants of the sport , hung tzu-hsiang from chinese taipei and koki niwa from japan .
chinese taipei 's hung tzu-hsiang securing the first game 11-9 and there were massive cheers for the underdog .
but the japanese yokohama champion was determined to win .
eventually the japanese paddler koki niwa emerged victorious with a score of 9-11 , 11-8 , 13-11 , 13-15 , 11-7 and 15-13 .
it was a truly amazing match between the two players and shows how much talent competitors at the youth olympic games have .
day 10 - tues 24 august : reporters gabriella and mimi day 10 has proved to be very exciting with thirteen events being held including athletics , cycling , table tennis and archery , and medals events for boxing , diving and the individual equestrian finals .
at the turf club riding centre , the crowd was buzzing with excitement .
the two rounds of show jumping ended with places tied for both first and third and so there was a jump-off with six riders competing for bronze and two riders competing for gold .
the show jumping competition had an exciting jump-off to decide the medals dalma malhas , from the kingdom of saudi arabia , made history as the first saudi female equestrian competitor .
she raced over the jumps at an amazing speed and came third winning bronze on flash top hat in 38.05 seconds .
marcelo chirico from uruguay won gold on links hot gossip , with a clear round in only 42.35 seconds .
mario gamboa from columbia went home with silver .
the winners left the arena after cantering around waving their hats in the air to loud applause .
the only sadness was that both carian scudamore from great britain and valentina isoardi from italy , who both won gold medals in the team event , had to pull out of the individual competition as their horses were lame .
another amazing event today was the table tennis mixed doubles preliminary .
it started at 10am and was held at the indoor stadium .
lots of local students from singapore were very loud spectators and it created a great atmosphere - it was amazing to actually be there !
we were particularly supporting alice loveridge from guernsey who was playing for great britain and her partner leonardo mutti .
team gb competitor alice loveridge came 17th overall in the singles alice and leo were competing in a group of four and although they lost two of their three games in the first stage they will play again tomorrow .
at the end of the day we interviewed alice about how if felt to compete at the first-ever youth olympic games .
she said : " compared to all the other international competitions the atmosphere is great and i have much more support from home .
singapore is also a very nice place and amazingly clean . "
we also asked alice about the difference between playing singles and doubles matches .
she said : " the doubles is more challenging because your partner is relying on you . "
after talking to her you could really tell she has had a great time .
it seems the youth olympic games has been an amazing experience for everyone .
day 9 - mon 23 august : reporters viraaj and jack it was yet another exciting day in the youth olympic games but we were sad to see that it was the last day of the athletic events , especially as this is such a popular crowd pleaser .
we were also disappointed to see rain today , but this was no surprise to the singaporians who are used to the tropical climate - we are just one degree north of the equator so it rains torrentially here !
the girls ' hammer throw was the first event of the day .
the rain made it quite difficult for the competitors by making the field slippery .
and in the boy 's competition the audience were surprised to see the favourite sebastian dobkowski from poland not receive a medal .
instead china 's lui binbin took home the gold in that event .
on the track the kenyans carried on their tradition of winning the steeplechase - good for them !
odane skeen celebrates his successes in the sprint races finally , the relay events were very interesting because the teams were organised by continents rather than countries .
odane skeen from jamaica won his second gold medal of the tournament by winning the track and field event for the america 's .
on saturday he won the 100m final .
it was thrilling to watch him , and like many others , we wonder if perhaps he is the next usain bolt !
so , despite the rain-related-problems we are proud to see such sporting excellence displayed in our country .
day 8 - sun 22 august : reporters merlin and shresht it was another spectacular day in the incredible two weeks that is the 2010 youth olympics !
the ambience was especially amazing during the two and a half hours of the junior men 's cycling road-race final .
a lot of the riders had interesting strategies , such as jay mccarthy who decided to bridge a 40 second gap breakaway all by himself on the last five laps .
it was an incredible thing that he did and the audience gave him much applause .
mccarthy eventually ended up in 19th place and the gold-medal winner was rafael ferreira reis from portugal .
australian diver hannah thek impressed the crowds today 's diving finals were also very dramatic .
the girls winner was china 's lui jiao with a total score of 479.60 but australian hannah thek did some amazing moves and her more technical stunts got much applause from the crowd .
she was unlucky to score only five 's and six 's throughout the day but her efforts were tremendous and it showed .
finally , the canoeing and kayaking competitions deserve a special mention as the audience absolutely loved the obvious tension in these events .
jessica fox was the first aussie on the water this morning in an event that was new to her , but she still ended up eighth in the qualifying out of 24 .
it was an exciting competition to watch - it is phenomenal to see people so young with so much talent and for kids from all over the world to come to singapore showcase their talents to the world .
the youth olympics is a truly spectacular event .
we still ca n't believe it is right on our doorstep !
day 7 - sat 21 august : reporters aayesha and aanchal against the majestic background of benjamin sheares bridge , the canoe-kayak event was held with participants from 24 countries today .
we went along to watch this event and so saw for ourselves the contestants showcasing impressive manoeuvring skills and speed .
queiroz from brazil being the fastest in the canoe sprint and hungary held the best times for both the men and women 's kayaking .
queiroz from brazil was fastest in the canoe sprint competition of the other medal events that took place today , the men 's archery final was probably the most tense .
the audience waited anxiously as each finalist held their bow with immense concentration .
ibrahim sabry of egypt outshone his opponent in each round with his consistent accurate shots , resulting in him receiving egypt 's first gold medal .
but the most vibrant audience by far was for the popular gymnastics event , especially when 15 year old viktoria komova from russia received her second and third gold medals !
the competition and pressure were running high for each competitor and the diverse audience cheered loudly in support of their different countries .
with so many different sports and countries involved the youth olympic games is a wonderful event !
day 6 - fri 20 august : reporters rico and gene today a total of eight different sports took place at the singapore youth olympic games , including gymnastics , handball , sailing and swimming .
but in our opinion , the swimming events were by far the most exciting .
we tuned in to watch the rising tension at the singapore sports school where the final swimming events were held .
there were still some singapore swimmers competing and all were looking to grab another medal - we were , of course , rooting for them !
