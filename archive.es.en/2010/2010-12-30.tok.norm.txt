the red devils were first-division fixtures for 33 years , then got relegated in 1996 thanks to a last-minute goal .
they immediately went back up and won the league in 1998 - the only newly promoted german team ever to do so .
but financial problems followed and lautern spent 2006 to 2010 back in the second division . now they 're back in the top flight , and with some of germany 's most fanatic supporters and a young squad capable of improvement , lautern have a decent chance of staying there .
fun fact : with around 100,000 inhabitants , kaiserslautern is one of the league 's smallest markets .
