bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .

yet rebel factions and the sudanese government are still at loggerheads .
analysts say home-grown solutions and local ownership are the only real fix to this war . the commander of the combined united nations-african union peacekeeping force for darfur , general martin agwai , has claimed the war in darfur is over , now that the vicious fighting over the past six years has subsided , with the rebel groups having disbanded into insignificant factions .
agwai says the darfur region now suffers more from low-level disputes , like banditry and localized issues over water and land .
peaceful coexistence in social structures such as communities and villages has not yet been restored in sudan .
the eastern region of sudan 's neighbouring country , chad , is currently host to over 250,000 darfur refugees and more than 2 million sudanese are internally displaced .
despite the rhetoric coming from agwai about the war being over , sudan 's refugees clearly do not feel safe enough to return to their homes and try to rebuild their lives .
political analysts strongly reject agwai 's assertion that the war in darfur has reached a resolution .
" this is incredibly premature , " said colin thomas-jensen , policy adviser for " enough , " the anti-genocide project at the center for american progress in washington .
" to say the war in darfur is over directly contradicts what we see on the ground .
there may be a lull in the violence , but you can not say that it is over .
there is no political settlement and no political process to resolve the conflict .
neither side is defeated and the government is still building up its arms stockpile . "
under fire from analysts who say his reports have wrongfully given the impression that sudan 's problems have been solved , agwai insists the real problem now is political .
it is clear that there can not be long-term solutions to the darfur crisis without a resolution of the political conflicts behind it .
dr annette weber , of the german institute for international security affairs , emphasizes that the conflict in darfur will remain intractable without commitment from its three major spoilers - the rebels , the government and the government proxies - toward sustainable peace .
she told deutsche welle : " the problem is this : the spoilers in this war must feel convinced that they can gain something from a peaceful situation for them to make a commitment to it . "
darfur peace agreement not up to scratch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur rebel groups are unhappy with the darfur peace agreement .
the conflict in darfur is only a window to a larger political problem that has remained unresolved despite several rounds of peace talks organized by the african union , which were in turn funded by western donors such as the eu , the us and canada .
the seventh round of the peace talks held in 2006 in abuja , nigeria , was more successful and led to the signing of the darfur peace agreement by both the sudanese government and the faction of the rebel group , the sudan liberation movement / army led by minni minnawi .
the darfur peace agreement dealt with darfur 's political representation at national and regional levels , the allocation of national resources and security aspects .
these included , in particular , the disarming of the janjaweed militias and the integration of rebel fighters into the regular security forces .
it was an agreement drafted with high hopes for a ceasefire from all sides followed by a power-sharing accord , but expectations have since been disappointed .
the darfur peace agreement has neither improved the security situation in darfur nor led to a comprehensive political solution to the conflict .
and as a result of ´ it , the rebel movements have split into numerous groups , making a negotiated solution even more difficult .
minnawi only signed the darfur peace agreement under strong international pressure , while the other two rebel movements , the faction of the sudan liberation movement / army led by abdul wahid and the justice and equality movement -lrb- jem -rrb- led by khalil ibrahim , rejected the agreement because it did not meet their expectations .
the failure of the agreement is no surprise to weber .
" the darfur peace agreement is just words on paper without local ownership , " she said .
" the agreement is not focused on local ownership and that 's why it has n't gained any ground . "
local ownership key to long-term solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel groups have engaged in meetings with un and au special envoys for darfur with inconclusive results .
peace in sudan may remain unattainable as long as peace agreements are conceptualized entirely by outsiders and merely expected to be implemented by the local actors .
establishing local ownership remains a crucial factor in peacebuilding efforts .
experts say the relationship between international donors and local actors in peacebuilding is often assymetrically imbalanced , therefore peaceful objectives are hardly met because the local actors are not brought on board to develop home-grown solutions .
dr jörn grävingholt , a political scientist with the german development institute , told deutsche welle , " international partners need to get a clear mandate in order to work with people and accompany them in their attempts at transforming their own conflict .
long-lasting peace can only grow from the inside . "
fervent peace talks are still underway toward a resolution to the darfur conflict but long-lasting solutions may remain elusive for some time to come . weber explains that the complex nature of the darfur conflict entails that solutions will not be easily reached .
" we are all looking for some quick fix to this situation but it wo n't be a quick fix .
there 's no local ownership on the agenda at the moment .
we do n't know anything about the people 's needs and what they want , except that they would like to leave the camps .
and we 've wrongfully promoted the idea that if you pursue negotiations , that 'll surely provide solutions , " she said .
call for context-specific considerations political analysts point out that a major error in peacebuilding is focusing on ending the violence in a war without considering long-term , context-specific political solutions .
intrusive methods in peacebuilding , such as have been implemented in darfur with the involvement of the joint un-african union peacekeeping force that has succeeded in quelling the violence , are indeed often effective but analysts warn that they also alienate the political actors on the ground who are essential to conflict resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending violence is only the first step to ending war , say experts .
" you must consider the long-term consequences early on in conflict transformation and bring the relevant local actors on board , " said grävingholt .
" do n't just come in to end the violence without considering that beforehand . " presuming that having an understanding of the reasons for a conflict determines an ability to come up with resolutions , as with the case of the darfur peace agreement , may be a misjudgement . matthias reis of the german development service calls for more considerate approaches in peacebuilding : " we should listen to the local actors more .
they know much better how to solve their own conflicts than anyone else .
we must also accept the fact that we deal with very different societies who do n't always want to develop in the direction we want them to or think they should , " he told deutsche welle .
grävingholt also calls for different approaches in peacebuilding . " the danger is when international partners bring in their own preconceived notions about how the world should work , which have been conceived according to their own culture , norms and ideas , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to come up with solutions that fit the people in that particular country , according to their own culture and history . "
the international community has demonstrated its support to darfur 's problems , and sudan at large .
the uproar from human rights organizations about the war in darfur has helped influence committment from western leaders toward resolving it .
nonetheless , weber insists even deeper commitment from international partners is crucial to sustainable peace in the region .
" long-term commitment is needed in darfur , " she said .
" the international community needs to stick with the situation and not just show up for a little while and then leave . "

it will be held one week before london hosts an international summit on the conflict . germany 's opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are to hold a conference to discuss germany 's domestically unpopular military presence in afghanistan .
the january 22 debate will take place just one week ahead of an international summit on afghanistan to be hosted by british prime minister gordon brown in london .
the spd said in a statement on its website that it would stage its own conference because germany 's incumbent coalition government , led by chancellor angela merkel , had not held an effective debate on the country 's engagement in afghanistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .

the spd said in a statement on its website that it would stage its own conference because germany 's incumbent coalition government , led by chancellor angela merkel , had not held an effective debate on the country 's engagement in afghanistan .
" since the beginning of the afghanistan mission the spd has insisted on the fact that political and economic development must be at the center of the international engagement , " the statement said .
" the aim must be to strengthen the direct responsibility of afghanistan and create the conditions for an end to the military engagement … the -lrb- current german -rrb- coalition has avoided this debate up to now , " it added .
speakers at the spd event are to include afghan foreign minister rangin dadfar and the european union 's newly installed top foreign affairs official , catherine ashton .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 09.01.2010 experts urge rethinking of peacebuilding efforts in darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports that the war in darfur is over have been called " premature " the war in darfur has experienced a lull in violence .
yet rebel factions and the sudanese government are still at loggerheads .
analysts say home-grown solutions and local ownership are the only real fix to this war . the commander of the combined united nations-african union peacekeeping force for darfur , general martin agwai , has claimed the war in darfur is over , now that the vicious fighting over the past six years has subsided , with the rebel groups having disbanded into insignificant factions .
agwai says the darfur region now suffers more from low-level disputes , like banditry and localized issues over water and land .
peaceful coexistence in social structures such as communities and villages has not yet been restored in sudan .
the eastern region of sudan 's neighbouring country , chad , is currently host to over 250,000 darfur refugees and more than 2 million sudanese are internally displaced .
despite the rhetoric coming from agwai about the war being over , sudan 's refugees clearly do not feel safe enough to return to their homes and try to rebuild their lives .
political analysts strongly reject agwai 's assertion that the war in darfur has reached a resolution .
" this is incredibly premature , " said colin thomas-jensen , policy adviser for " enough , " the anti-genocide project at the center for american progress in washington .
" to say the war in darfur is over directly contradicts what we see on the ground .
there may be a lull in the violence , but you can not say that it is over .
there is no political settlement and no political process to resolve the conflict .
neither side is defeated and the government is still building up its arms stockpile . "
under fire from analysts who say his reports have wrongfully given the impression that sudan 's problems have been solved , agwai insists the real problem now is political .
it is clear that there can not be long-term solutions to the darfur crisis without a resolution of the political conflicts behind it .
dr annette weber , of the german institute for international security affairs , emphasizes that the conflict in darfur will remain intractable without commitment from its three major spoilers - the rebels , the government and the government proxies - toward sustainable peace .
she told deutsche welle : " the problem is this : the spoilers in this war must feel convinced that they can gain something from a peaceful situation for them to make a commitment to it . "
darfur peace agreement not up to scratch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur rebel groups are unhappy with the darfur peace agreement .
the conflict in darfur is only a window to a larger political problem that has remained unresolved despite several rounds of peace talks organized by the african union , which were in turn funded by western donors such as the eu , the us and canada .
the seventh round of the peace talks held in 2006 in abuja , nigeria , was more successful and led to the signing of the darfur peace agreement by both the sudanese government and the faction of the rebel group , the sudan liberation movement / army led by minni minnawi .
the darfur peace agreement dealt with darfur 's political representation at national and regional levels , the allocation of national resources and security aspects .
these included , in particular , the disarming of the janjaweed militias and the integration of rebel fighters into the regular security forces .
it was an agreement drafted with high hopes for a ceasefire from all sides followed by a power-sharing accord , but expectations have since been disappointed .
the darfur peace agreement has neither improved the security situation in darfur nor led to a comprehensive political solution to the conflict .
and as a result of ´ it , the rebel movements have split into numerous groups , making a negotiated solution even more difficult .
minnawi only signed the darfur peace agreement under strong international pressure , while the other two rebel movements , the faction of the sudan liberation movement / army led by abdul wahid and the justice and equality movement -lrb- jem -rrb- led by khalil ibrahim , rejected the agreement because it did not meet their expectations .
the failure of the agreement is no surprise to weber .
" the darfur peace agreement is just words on paper without local ownership , " she said .
" the agreement is not focused on local ownership and that 's why it has n't gained any ground . "
local ownership key to long-term solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel groups have engaged in meetings with un and au special envoys for darfur with inconclusive results .
peace in sudan may remain unattainable as long as peace agreements are conceptualized entirely by outsiders and merely expected to be implemented by the local actors .
establishing local ownership remains a crucial factor in peacebuilding efforts .
experts say the relationship between international donors and local actors in peacebuilding is often assymetrically imbalanced , therefore peaceful objectives are hardly met because the local actors are not brought on board to develop home-grown solutions .
dr jörn grävingholt , a political scientist with the german development institute , told deutsche welle , " international partners need to get a clear mandate in order to work with people and accompany them in their attempts at transforming their own conflict .
long-lasting peace can only grow from the inside . "
fervent peace talks are still underway toward a resolution to the darfur conflict but long-lasting solutions may remain elusive for some time to come . weber explains that the complex nature of the darfur conflict entails that solutions will not be easily reached .
" we are all looking for some quick fix to this situation but it wo n't be a quick fix .
there 's no local ownership on the agenda at the moment .
we do n't know anything about the people 's needs and what they want , except that they would like to leave the camps .
and we 've wrongfully promoted the idea that if you pursue negotiations , that 'll surely provide solutions , " she said .
call for context-specific considerations political analysts point out that a major error in peacebuilding is focusing on ending the violence in a war without considering long-term , context-specific political solutions .
intrusive methods in peacebuilding , such as have been implemented in darfur with the involvement of the joint un-african union peacekeeping force that has succeeded in quelling the violence , are indeed often effective but analysts warn that they also alienate the political actors on the ground who are essential to conflict resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending violence is only the first step to ending war , say experts .
" you must consider the long-term consequences early on in conflict transformation and bring the relevant local actors on board , " said grävingholt .
" do n't just come in to end the violence without considering that beforehand . " presuming that having an understanding of the reasons for a conflict determines an ability to come up with resolutions , as with the case of the darfur peace agreement , may be a misjudgement . matthias reis of the german development service calls for more considerate approaches in peacebuilding : " we should listen to the local actors more .
they know much better how to solve their own conflicts than anyone else .
we must also accept the fact that we deal with very different societies who do n't always want to develop in the direction we want them to or think they should , " he told deutsche welle .
grävingholt also calls for different approaches in peacebuilding . " the danger is when international partners bring in their own preconceived notions about how the world should work , which have been conceived according to their own culture , norms and ideas , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to come up with solutions that fit the people in that particular country , according to their own culture and history . "
the international community has demonstrated its support to darfur 's problems , and sudan at large .
the uproar from human rights organizations about the war in darfur has helped influence committment from western leaders toward resolving it .
nonetheless , weber insists even deeper commitment from international partners is crucial to sustainable peace in the region .
" long-term commitment is needed in darfur , " she said .
" the international community needs to stick with the situation and not just show up for a little while and then leave . "

it will be held one week before london hosts an international summit on the conflict . germany 's opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are to hold a conference to discuss germany 's domestically unpopular military presence in afghanistan .
the january 22 debate will take place just one week ahead of an international summit on afghanistan to be hosted by british prime minister gordon brown in london .
the spd said in a statement on its website that it would stage its own conference because germany 's incumbent coalition government , led by chancellor angela merkel , had not held an effective debate on the country 's engagement in afghanistan .
" since the beginning of the afghanistan mission the spd has insisted on the fact that political and economic development must be at the center of the international engagement , " the statement said .
" the aim must be to strengthen the direct responsibility of afghanistan and create the conditions for an end to the military engagement … the -lrb- current german -rrb- coalition has avoided this debate up to now , " it added .
speakers at the spd event are to include afghan foreign minister rangin dadfar and the european union 's newly installed top foreign affairs official , catherine ashton .

german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg told the daily newspaper , the leipziger volkszeitung , this week that concrete plans would be announced in london , and that they would concern more than just new troop levels .
" germany has not changed its stance : a stable future for afghanistan is not something that can be achieved by military means alone .
we will focus our concentration on civilian reconstruction efforts so that afghanistan can begin to establish its own security and determine its own future , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .

the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .
entangled with history mendelssohn-bartholdy reportedly sent his three picassos to switzerland for safekeeping shortly after the nazis came to power in germany in 1933 .
soon thereafter , he ordered that they be sold . mendelssohn-bartholdy died in 1935 . his valuable paintings eventually ended up in the guggenhim , moma and the andrew lloyd webber foundation , but one of his heirs , julius schoeps , a grandson of one of von mendelssohn-bartholdy 's sisters , sued in a bid to reclaim them . " the absinthe drinker , " which was painted by picasso in 1903 , is worth around 41 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- . mk / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" since the beginning of the afghanistan mission the spd has insisted on the fact that political and economic development must be at the center of the international engagement , " the statement said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .
entangled with history mendelssohn-bartholdy reportedly sent his three picassos to switzerland for safekeeping shortly after the nazis came to power in germany in 1933 .
soon thereafter , he ordered that they be sold . mendelssohn-bartholdy died in 1935 . his valuable paintings eventually ended up in the guggenhim , moma and the andrew lloyd webber foundation , but one of his heirs , julius schoeps , a grandson of one of von mendelssohn-bartholdy 's sisters , sued in a bid to reclaim them . " the absinthe drinker , " which was painted by picasso in 1903 , is worth around 41 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- . mk / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .
entangled with history mendelssohn-bartholdy reportedly sent his three picassos to switzerland for safekeeping shortly after the nazis came to power in germany in 1933 .
soon thereafter , he ordered that they be sold . mendelssohn-bartholdy died in 1935 . his valuable paintings eventually ended up in the guggenhim , moma and the andrew lloyd webber foundation , but one of his heirs , julius schoeps , a grandson of one of von mendelssohn-bartholdy 's sisters , sued in a bid to reclaim them . " the absinthe drinker , " which was painted by picasso in 1903 , is worth around 41 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- . mk / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 09.01.2010 experts urge rethinking of peacebuilding efforts in darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports that the war in darfur is over have been called " premature " the war in darfur has experienced a lull in violence .
yet rebel factions and the sudanese government are still at loggerheads .
analysts say home-grown solutions and local ownership are the only real fix to this war . the commander of the combined united nations-african union peacekeeping force for darfur , general martin agwai , has claimed the war in darfur is over , now that the vicious fighting over the past six years has subsided , with the rebel groups having disbanded into insignificant factions .
agwai says the darfur region now suffers more from low-level disputes , like banditry and localized issues over water and land .
peaceful coexistence in social structures such as communities and villages has not yet been restored in sudan .
the eastern region of sudan 's neighbouring country , chad , is currently host to over 250,000 darfur refugees and more than 2 million sudanese are internally displaced .
despite the rhetoric coming from agwai about the war being over , sudan 's refugees clearly do not feel safe enough to return to their homes and try to rebuild their lives .
political analysts strongly reject agwai 's assertion that the war in darfur has reached a resolution .
" this is incredibly premature , " said colin thomas-jensen , policy adviser for " enough , " the anti-genocide project at the center for american progress in washington .
" to say the war in darfur is over directly contradicts what we see on the ground .
there may be a lull in the violence , but you can not say that it is over .
there is no political settlement and no political process to resolve the conflict .
neither side is defeated and the government is still building up its arms stockpile . "
under fire from analysts who say his reports have wrongfully given the impression that sudan 's problems have been solved , agwai insists the real problem now is political .
it is clear that there can not be long-term solutions to the darfur crisis without a resolution of the political conflicts behind it .
dr annette weber , of the german institute for international security affairs , emphasizes that the conflict in darfur will remain intractable without commitment from its three major spoilers - the rebels , the government and the government proxies - toward sustainable peace .
she told deutsche welle : " the problem is this : the spoilers in this war must feel convinced that they can gain something from a peaceful situation for them to make a commitment to it . "
darfur peace agreement not up to scratch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur rebel groups are unhappy with the darfur peace agreement .
the conflict in darfur is only a window to a larger political problem that has remained unresolved despite several rounds of peace talks organized by the african union , which were in turn funded by western donors such as the eu , the us and canada .
the seventh round of the peace talks held in 2006 in abuja , nigeria , was more successful and led to the signing of the darfur peace agreement by both the sudanese government and the faction of the rebel group , the sudan liberation movement / army led by minni minnawi .
the darfur peace agreement dealt with darfur 's political representation at national and regional levels , the allocation of national resources and security aspects .
these included , in particular , the disarming of the janjaweed militias and the integration of rebel fighters into the regular security forces .
it was an agreement drafted with high hopes for a ceasefire from all sides followed by a power-sharing accord , but expectations have since been disappointed .
the darfur peace agreement has neither improved the security situation in darfur nor led to a comprehensive political solution to the conflict .
and as a result of ´ it , the rebel movements have split into numerous groups , making a negotiated solution even more difficult .
minnawi only signed the darfur peace agreement under strong international pressure , while the other two rebel movements , the faction of the sudan liberation movement / army led by abdul wahid and the justice and equality movement -lrb- jem -rrb- led by khalil ibrahim , rejected the agreement because it did not meet their expectations .
the failure of the agreement is no surprise to weber .
" the darfur peace agreement is just words on paper without local ownership , " she said .
" the agreement is not focused on local ownership and that 's why it has n't gained any ground . "
local ownership key to long-term solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel groups have engaged in meetings with un and au special envoys for darfur with inconclusive results .
peace in sudan may remain unattainable as long as peace agreements are conceptualized entirely by outsiders and merely expected to be implemented by the local actors .
establishing local ownership remains a crucial factor in peacebuilding efforts .
experts say the relationship between international donors and local actors in peacebuilding is often assymetrically imbalanced , therefore peaceful objectives are hardly met because the local actors are not brought on board to develop home-grown solutions .
dr jörn grävingholt , a political scientist with the german development institute , told deutsche welle , " international partners need to get a clear mandate in order to work with people and accompany them in their attempts at transforming their own conflict .
long-lasting peace can only grow from the inside . "
fervent peace talks are still underway toward a resolution to the darfur conflict but long-lasting solutions may remain elusive for some time to come . weber explains that the complex nature of the darfur conflict entails that solutions will not be easily reached .
" we are all looking for some quick fix to this situation but it wo n't be a quick fix .
there 's no local ownership on the agenda at the moment .
we do n't know anything about the people 's needs and what they want , except that they would like to leave the camps .
and we 've wrongfully promoted the idea that if you pursue negotiations , that 'll surely provide solutions , " she said .
call for context-specific considerations political analysts point out that a major error in peacebuilding is focusing on ending the violence in a war without considering long-term , context-specific political solutions .
intrusive methods in peacebuilding , such as have been implemented in darfur with the involvement of the joint un-african union peacekeeping force that has succeeded in quelling the violence , are indeed often effective but analysts warn that they also alienate the political actors on the ground who are essential to conflict resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending violence is only the first step to ending war , say experts .
" you must consider the long-term consequences early on in conflict transformation and bring the relevant local actors on board , " said grävingholt .
" do n't just come in to end the violence without considering that beforehand . " presuming that having an understanding of the reasons for a conflict determines an ability to come up with resolutions , as with the case of the darfur peace agreement , may be a misjudgement . matthias reis of the german development service calls for more considerate approaches in peacebuilding : " we should listen to the local actors more .
they know much better how to solve their own conflicts than anyone else .
we must also accept the fact that we deal with very different societies who do n't always want to develop in the direction we want them to or think they should , " he told deutsche welle .
grävingholt also calls for different approaches in peacebuilding . " the danger is when international partners bring in their own preconceived notions about how the world should work , which have been conceived according to their own culture , norms and ideas , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to come up with solutions that fit the people in that particular country , according to their own culture and history . "
the international community has demonstrated its support to darfur 's problems , and sudan at large .
the uproar from human rights organizations about the war in darfur has helped influence committment from western leaders toward resolving it .
nonetheless , weber insists even deeper commitment from international partners is crucial to sustainable peace in the region .
" long-term commitment is needed in darfur , " she said .
" the international community needs to stick with the situation and not just show up for a little while and then leave . "

peaceful coexistence in social structures such as communities and villages has not yet been restored in sudan .
the eastern region of sudan 's neighbouring country , chad , is currently host to over 250,000 darfur refugees and more than 2 million sudanese are internally displaced .
despite the rhetoric coming from agwai about the war being over , sudan 's refugees clearly do not feel safe enough to return to their homes and try to rebuild their lives .
political analysts strongly reject agwai 's assertion that the war in darfur has reached a resolution .
" this is incredibly premature , " said colin thomas-jensen , policy adviser for " enough , " the anti-genocide project at the center for american progress in washington .
" to say the war in darfur is over directly contradicts what we see on the ground .
there may be a lull in the violence , but you can not say that it is over .
there is no political settlement and no political process to resolve the conflict .
neither side is defeated and the government is still building up its arms stockpile . "
under fire from analysts who say his reports have wrongfully given the impression that sudan 's problems have been solved , agwai insists the real problem now is political .
it is clear that there can not be long-term solutions to the darfur crisis without a resolution of the political conflicts behind it .
dr annette weber , of the german institute for international security affairs , emphasizes that the conflict in darfur will remain intractable without commitment from its three major spoilers - the rebels , the government and the government proxies - toward sustainable peace .
she told deutsche welle : " the problem is this : the spoilers in this war must feel convinced that they can gain something from a peaceful situation for them to make a commitment to it . "
darfur peace agreement not up to scratch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur rebel groups are unhappy with the darfur peace agreement .
the conflict in darfur is only a window to a larger political problem that has remained unresolved despite several rounds of peace talks organized by the african union , which were in turn funded by western donors such as the eu , the us and canada .
the seventh round of the peace talks held in 2006 in abuja , nigeria , was more successful and led to the signing of the darfur peace agreement by both the sudanese government and the faction of the rebel group , the sudan liberation movement / army led by minni minnawi .
the darfur peace agreement dealt with darfur 's political representation at national and regional levels , the allocation of national resources and security aspects .
these included , in particular , the disarming of the janjaweed militias and the integration of rebel fighters into the regular security forces .
it was an agreement drafted with high hopes for a ceasefire from all sides followed by a power-sharing accord , but expectations have since been disappointed .
the darfur peace agreement has neither improved the security situation in darfur nor led to a comprehensive political solution to the conflict .
and as a result of ´ it , the rebel movements have split into numerous groups , making a negotiated solution even more difficult .
minnawi only signed the darfur peace agreement under strong international pressure , while the other two rebel movements , the faction of the sudan liberation movement / army led by abdul wahid and the justice and equality movement -lrb- jem -rrb- led by khalil ibrahim , rejected the agreement because it did not meet their expectations .
the failure of the agreement is no surprise to weber .
" the darfur peace agreement is just words on paper without local ownership , " she said .
" the agreement is not focused on local ownership and that 's why it has n't gained any ground . "
local ownership key to long-term solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel groups have engaged in meetings with un and au special envoys for darfur with inconclusive results .
peace in sudan may remain unattainable as long as peace agreements are conceptualized entirely by outsiders and merely expected to be implemented by the local actors .
establishing local ownership remains a crucial factor in peacebuilding efforts .
experts say the relationship between international donors and local actors in peacebuilding is often assymetrically imbalanced , therefore peaceful objectives are hardly met because the local actors are not brought on board to develop home-grown solutions .
dr jörn grävingholt , a political scientist with the german development institute , told deutsche welle , " international partners need to get a clear mandate in order to work with people and accompany them in their attempts at transforming their own conflict .
long-lasting peace can only grow from the inside . "
fervent peace talks are still underway toward a resolution to the darfur conflict but long-lasting solutions may remain elusive for some time to come . weber explains that the complex nature of the darfur conflict entails that solutions will not be easily reached .
" we are all looking for some quick fix to this situation but it wo n't be a quick fix .
there 's no local ownership on the agenda at the moment .
we do n't know anything about the people 's needs and what they want , except that they would like to leave the camps .
and we 've wrongfully promoted the idea that if you pursue negotiations , that 'll surely provide solutions , " she said .
call for context-specific considerations political analysts point out that a major error in peacebuilding is focusing on ending the violence in a war without considering long-term , context-specific political solutions .
intrusive methods in peacebuilding , such as have been implemented in darfur with the involvement of the joint un-african union peacekeeping force that has succeeded in quelling the violence , are indeed often effective but analysts warn that they also alienate the political actors on the ground who are essential to conflict resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending violence is only the first step to ending war , say experts .
" you must consider the long-term consequences early on in conflict transformation and bring the relevant local actors on board , " said grävingholt .
" do n't just come in to end the violence without considering that beforehand . " presuming that having an understanding of the reasons for a conflict determines an ability to come up with resolutions , as with the case of the darfur peace agreement , may be a misjudgement . matthias reis of the german development service calls for more considerate approaches in peacebuilding : " we should listen to the local actors more .
they know much better how to solve their own conflicts than anyone else .
we must also accept the fact that we deal with very different societies who do n't always want to develop in the direction we want them to or think they should , " he told deutsche welle .
grävingholt also calls for different approaches in peacebuilding . " the danger is when international partners bring in their own preconceived notions about how the world should work , which have been conceived according to their own culture , norms and ideas , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to come up with solutions that fit the people in that particular country , according to their own culture and history . "
the international community has demonstrated its support to darfur 's problems , and sudan at large .
the uproar from human rights organizations about the war in darfur has helped influence committment from western leaders toward resolving it .
nonetheless , weber insists even deeper commitment from international partners is crucial to sustainable peace in the region .
" long-term commitment is needed in darfur , " she said .
" the international community needs to stick with the situation and not just show up for a little while and then leave . "

the eastern region of sudan 's neighbouring country , chad , is currently host to over 250,000 darfur refugees and more than 2 million sudanese are internally displaced .
despite the rhetoric coming from agwai about the war being over , sudan 's refugees clearly do not feel safe enough to return to their homes and try to rebuild their lives .
political analysts strongly reject agwai 's assertion that the war in darfur has reached a resolution .
" this is incredibly premature , " said colin thomas-jensen , policy adviser for " enough , " the anti-genocide project at the center for american progress in washington .
" to say the war in darfur is over directly contradicts what we see on the ground .
there may be a lull in the violence , but you can not say that it is over .
there is no political settlement and no political process to resolve the conflict .
neither side is defeated and the government is still building up its arms stockpile . "
under fire from analysts who say his reports have wrongfully given the impression that sudan 's problems have been solved , agwai insists the real problem now is political .
it is clear that there can not be long-term solutions to the darfur crisis without a resolution of the political conflicts behind it .
dr annette weber , of the german institute for international security affairs , emphasizes that the conflict in darfur will remain intractable without commitment from its three major spoilers - the rebels , the government and the government proxies - toward sustainable peace .
she told deutsche welle : " the problem is this : the spoilers in this war must feel convinced that they can gain something from a peaceful situation for them to make a commitment to it . "
darfur peace agreement not up to scratch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur rebel groups are unhappy with the darfur peace agreement .
the conflict in darfur is only a window to a larger political problem that has remained unresolved despite several rounds of peace talks organized by the african union , which were in turn funded by western donors such as the eu , the us and canada .
the seventh round of the peace talks held in 2006 in abuja , nigeria , was more successful and led to the signing of the darfur peace agreement by both the sudanese government and the faction of the rebel group , the sudan liberation movement / army led by minni minnawi .
the darfur peace agreement dealt with darfur 's political representation at national and regional levels , the allocation of national resources and security aspects .
these included , in particular , the disarming of the janjaweed militias and the integration of rebel fighters into the regular security forces .
it was an agreement drafted with high hopes for a ceasefire from all sides followed by a power-sharing accord , but expectations have since been disappointed .
the darfur peace agreement has neither improved the security situation in darfur nor led to a comprehensive political solution to the conflict .
and as a result of ´ it , the rebel movements have split into numerous groups , making a negotiated solution even more difficult .
minnawi only signed the darfur peace agreement under strong international pressure , while the other two rebel movements , the faction of the sudan liberation movement / army led by abdul wahid and the justice and equality movement -lrb- jem -rrb- led by khalil ibrahim , rejected the agreement because it did not meet their expectations .
the failure of the agreement is no surprise to weber .
" the darfur peace agreement is just words on paper without local ownership , " she said .
" the agreement is not focused on local ownership and that 's why it has n't gained any ground . "
local ownership key to long-term solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel groups have engaged in meetings with un and au special envoys for darfur with inconclusive results .
peace in sudan may remain unattainable as long as peace agreements are conceptualized entirely by outsiders and merely expected to be implemented by the local actors .
establishing local ownership remains a crucial factor in peacebuilding efforts .
experts say the relationship between international donors and local actors in peacebuilding is often assymetrically imbalanced , therefore peaceful objectives are hardly met because the local actors are not brought on board to develop home-grown solutions .
dr jörn grävingholt , a political scientist with the german development institute , told deutsche welle , " international partners need to get a clear mandate in order to work with people and accompany them in their attempts at transforming their own conflict .
long-lasting peace can only grow from the inside . "
fervent peace talks are still underway toward a resolution to the darfur conflict but long-lasting solutions may remain elusive for some time to come . weber explains that the complex nature of the darfur conflict entails that solutions will not be easily reached .
" we are all looking for some quick fix to this situation but it wo n't be a quick fix .
there 's no local ownership on the agenda at the moment .
we do n't know anything about the people 's needs and what they want , except that they would like to leave the camps .
and we 've wrongfully promoted the idea that if you pursue negotiations , that 'll surely provide solutions , " she said .
call for context-specific considerations political analysts point out that a major error in peacebuilding is focusing on ending the violence in a war without considering long-term , context-specific political solutions .
intrusive methods in peacebuilding , such as have been implemented in darfur with the involvement of the joint un-african union peacekeeping force that has succeeded in quelling the violence , are indeed often effective but analysts warn that they also alienate the political actors on the ground who are essential to conflict resolution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ending violence is only the first step to ending war , say experts .
" you must consider the long-term consequences early on in conflict transformation and bring the relevant local actors on board , " said grävingholt .
" do n't just come in to end the violence without considering that beforehand . " presuming that having an understanding of the reasons for a conflict determines an ability to come up with resolutions , as with the case of the darfur peace agreement , may be a misjudgement . matthias reis of the german development service calls for more considerate approaches in peacebuilding : " we should listen to the local actors more .
they know much better how to solve their own conflicts than anyone else .
we must also accept the fact that we deal with very different societies who do n't always want to develop in the direction we want them to or think they should , " he told deutsche welle .
grävingholt also calls for different approaches in peacebuilding . " the danger is when international partners bring in their own preconceived notions about how the world should work , which have been conceived according to their own culture , norms and ideas , " he said .
" so it 's difficult to come up with solutions that fit the people in that particular country , according to their own culture and history . "
the international community has demonstrated its support to darfur 's problems , and sudan at large .
the uproar from human rights organizations about the war in darfur has helped influence committment from western leaders toward resolving it .
nonetheless , weber insists even deeper commitment from international partners is crucial to sustainable peace in the region .
" long-term commitment is needed in darfur , " she said .
" the international community needs to stick with the situation and not just show up for a little while and then leave . "

it will be held one week before london hosts an international summit on the conflict . germany 's opposition center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are to hold a conference to discuss germany 's domestically unpopular military presence in afghanistan .
the january 22 debate will take place just one week ahead of an international summit on afghanistan to be hosted by british prime minister gordon brown in london .

prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .
entangled with history mendelssohn-bartholdy reportedly sent his three picassos to switzerland for safekeeping shortly after the nazis came to power in germany in 1933 .
soon thereafter , he ordered that they be sold . mendelssohn-bartholdy died in 1935 . his valuable paintings eventually ended up in the guggenhim , moma and the andrew lloyd webber foundation , but one of his heirs , julius schoeps , a grandson of one of von mendelssohn-bartholdy 's sisters , sued in a bid to reclaim them .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
britain is grinding towards a general election , to be held possibly as soon as may , and definitely by the end of june. td / dpa / afpd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under the terms of the settlement , byrne was not at liberty to discuss the terms of the deal .
last year , the mendelssohn-bartholdy heirs reached settlements with the metropolitan museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum , both in new york , to keep two other picasso works that had belonged to their ancestor .
the family argued that mendelssohn-bartholdy sold the paintings under duress during the rise of the nazi party in germany .
entangled with history mendelssohn-bartholdy reportedly sent his three picassos to switzerland for safekeeping shortly after the nazis came to power in germany in 1933 .
soon thereafter , he ordered that they be sold . mendelssohn-bartholdy died in 1935 . his valuable paintings eventually ended up in the guggenhim , moma and the andrew lloyd webber foundation , but one of his heirs , julius schoeps , a grandson of one of von mendelssohn-bartholdy 's sisters , sued in a bid to reclaim them .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .

brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies will use their know-how in the uk brown hopes that by 2020 , some 25 percent of the uk 's electricity needs will be met by wind power via the erection of 6,400 wind turbines within 9 sites around the coast of the island .
the leading german energy concerns , rwe , siemens and e.on along with other international partners , have been awarded contracts to build wind farms at sites off the coast of scotland , and norfolk , in the irish sea , the bristol channel and to the west of the isle of wight in the south .
prime minister brown said the project , when completed , could yield up to 32 gigawatts of power within ten years , enough for almost a quarter of all the homes in britain .
it would also generate 70,000 jobs .
in addition , the massive increase in the use of wind energy could potentially reduce britain 's carbon emissions by 40 million tonnes a year .
at an estimated cost of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 160 billion -rrb- , the project would also hugely benefit germany .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk prime minister gordon brown wants britain to become a green energy leader most people in the uk approve of green energy although there has been opposition to the location of some of the wind parks .
the more vociferous protesters have been reassured that the majority of the thousands of turbines will be so far away from land as to be virtually invisible .
brown 's critics find it regrettable that so few british firms will be involved in the massive construction project .
and however green the project may be , britain currently lacks the electrical infrastructure necessary to transfer the future power from the offshore wind farms across the country .
this is expected to push up the budget considerably .
