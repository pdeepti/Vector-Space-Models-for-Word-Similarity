its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .
to transcribe all of it or a part of it is considered a pious task - one that inspired people to create imaginative artwork over the centuries . in this way , richly-illustrated scripts came into existence , as well as painted tiles , inscriptions in stone , portable miniature guides to quran manuscripts , and delicately engraved mother of pearl shells and chestnut leaves .
many of these things have survived to this day . " apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .
junod himself hopes that many german muslims also visit the exhibition and feel proud of their heritage . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .

elections for north rhine-westphalia are scheduled for may 9 .
the ruling coalition could lose to a far-left combination of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , greens and the left party .
north rhine-westphalia is currently governed by a coalition of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the same combination as the national government in berlin .
litmus test the regional election is merkel 's first electoral test since her center-right coalition took office nearly five months ago .
polls show voters are dissatisfied with the constant bickering within the center-right coalition government on a range of issues from fiscal policy , health reforms and nuclear power .
" the largest state must be governed soundly , as it ca n't be the location for ' experiments ' with uncertain conclusions , " merkel told a cdu party convention in the western city of muenster .
" class struggle is yesterday 's thing , " merkel said .
" class struggle is not what will take us forward , " she added , in reference to the left party 's marxist rhetoric .
in parts the left party is a successor to the communist party of east germany .
the election outcome could affect the cdu 's majority in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament , where north rhine-westphalia 's 13.5 million voters could tip the balance of power if they voted the cdu out of office .
according to an opinion poll conducted by zdf tv channel , both the christian democrats and the social democrats would receive less votes than they did in regional elections five years ago .
the cdu has 37 percent , compared to 33 percent for the spd , the greens have 12 percent , the fdp 8 percent and the left party have 6 percent. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment & development -pipe- 21.03.2010 german publishers asked to open a new chapter on world forest day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love to read , but rainforests are paying a high price a recent wwf study found many books printed for the german market contained paper sourced from rainforests in asia .
publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .
to transcribe all of it or a part of it is considered a pious task - one that inspired people to create imaginative artwork over the centuries . in this way , richly-illustrated scripts came into existence , as well as painted tiles , inscriptions in stone , portable miniature guides to quran manuscripts , and delicately engraved mother of pearl shells and chestnut leaves .
many of these things have survived to this day . " apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .
junod himself hopes that many german muslims also visit the exhibition and feel proud of their heritage . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elections for north rhine-westphalia are scheduled for may 9 .
the ruling coalition could lose to a far-left combination of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , greens and the left party .
north rhine-westphalia is currently governed by a coalition of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the same combination as the national government in berlin .
litmus test the regional election is merkel 's first electoral test since her center-right coalition took office nearly five months ago .
polls show voters are dissatisfied with the constant bickering within the center-right coalition government on a range of issues from fiscal policy , health reforms and nuclear power .
" the largest state must be governed soundly , as it ca n't be the location for ' experiments ' with uncertain conclusions , " merkel told a cdu party convention in the western city of muenster .
" class struggle is yesterday 's thing , " merkel said .
" class struggle is not what will take us forward , " she added , in reference to the left party 's marxist rhetoric .
in parts the left party is a successor to the communist party of east germany .

elections for north rhine-westphalia are scheduled for may 9 .
the ruling coalition could lose to a far-left combination of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , greens and the left party .
north rhine-westphalia is currently governed by a coalition of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the same combination as the national government in berlin .
litmus test the regional election is merkel 's first electoral test since her center-right coalition took office nearly five months ago .
polls show voters are dissatisfied with the constant bickering within the center-right coalition government on a range of issues from fiscal policy , health reforms and nuclear power .
" the largest state must be governed soundly , as it ca n't be the location for ' experiments ' with uncertain conclusions , " merkel told a cdu party convention in the western city of muenster .
" class struggle is yesterday 's thing , " merkel said .
" class struggle is not what will take us forward , " she added , in reference to the left party 's marxist rhetoric .
in parts the left party is a successor to the communist party of east germany .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .
to transcribe all of it or a part of it is considered a pious task - one that inspired people to create imaginative artwork over the centuries . in this way , richly-illustrated scripts came into existence , as well as painted tiles , inscriptions in stone , portable miniature guides to quran manuscripts , and delicately engraved mother of pearl shells and chestnut leaves .
many of these things have survived to this day . " apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .
junod himself hopes that many german muslims also visit the exhibition and feel proud of their heritage . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elections for north rhine-westphalia are scheduled for may 9 .
the ruling coalition could lose to a far-left combination of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , greens and the left party .
north rhine-westphalia is currently governed by a coalition of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the same combination as the national government in berlin .
litmus test the regional election is merkel 's first electoral test since her center-right coalition took office nearly five months ago .
polls show voters are dissatisfied with the constant bickering within the center-right coalition government on a range of issues from fiscal policy , health reforms and nuclear power .
" the largest state must be governed soundly , as it ca n't be the location for ' experiments ' with uncertain conclusions , " merkel told a cdu party convention in the western city of muenster .
" class struggle is yesterday 's thing , " merkel said .
" class struggle is not what will take us forward , " she added , in reference to the left party 's marxist rhetoric .
in parts the left party is a successor to the communist party of east germany .

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yes , we did have that , " he said , but denied allegations that he personally had suppressed information .
while most cases happened outside the church , " assaults that took place in such numbers within our institutions shame and frighten me , " zollitsch told focus .
" every single case darkens the face of the entire church , " he said .
zollitsch emphasized , however , that the church has been moving for years in the other direction to uncover and investigate reported cases of sexual abuse .
the archbishop was critical of proposals to file a complaint in every instance of suspected abuse .
he said many victims had told him explicitly that they did not desire legal action .
he stressed that it was also important to avoid baseless allegations which could ruin the lives of those falsely accused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and zollitsch have tried in vain to limit the damage on saturday , zollitsch apologized personally for a cover-up of sexual abuse that happened 20 years ago while he was in charge of human resources and staffing in the freiburg diocese .
victims disappointed by papal letter meanwhile , many abuse victims have expressed deep disappointment with the content of a pastoral letter published by pope benedict xvi on saturday .
victims in ireland , to whom the letter was addressed , said the pontiff had not accepted the responsibility of the vatican , nor did he recognize that there was a structural problem within the church .
" my first reaction was deep disappointment , " said maeve lewis from the one-in-four alliance .
catholics in the united states said the pope should have mentioned the extent of sexual abuse in numerous countries .

" yes , we did have that , " he said , but denied allegations that he personally had suppressed information .
while most cases happened outside the church , " assaults that took place in such numbers within our institutions shame and frighten me , " zollitsch told focus .
" every single case darkens the face of the entire church , " he said .
zollitsch emphasized , however , that the church has been moving for years in the other direction to uncover and investigate reported cases of sexual abuse .
the archbishop was critical of proposals to file a complaint in every instance of suspected abuse .
he said many victims had told him explicitly that they did not desire legal action .
he stressed that it was also important to avoid baseless allegations which could ruin the lives of those falsely accused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and zollitsch have tried in vain to limit the damage on saturday , zollitsch apologized personally for a cover-up of sexual abuse that happened 20 years ago while he was in charge of human resources and staffing in the freiburg diocese .
victims disappointed by papal letter meanwhile , many abuse victims have expressed deep disappointment with the content of a pastoral letter published by pope benedict xvi on saturday .
victims in ireland , to whom the letter was addressed , said the pontiff had not accepted the responsibility of the vatican , nor did he recognize that there was a structural problem within the church .
" my first reaction was deep disappointment , " said maeve lewis from the one-in-four alliance .
catholics in the united states said the pope should have mentioned the extent of sexual abuse in numerous countries .
benedict also made no reference to the cases in germany , his home country. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yes , we did have that , " he said , but denied allegations that he personally had suppressed information .
while most cases happened outside the church , " assaults that took place in such numbers within our institutions shame and frighten me , " zollitsch told focus .

zollitsch emphasized , however , that the church has been moving for years in the other direction to uncover and investigate reported cases of sexual abuse .
the archbishop was critical of proposals to file a complaint in every instance of suspected abuse .
he said many victims had told him explicitly that they did not desire legal action .
he stressed that it was also important to avoid baseless allegations which could ruin the lives of those falsely accused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and zollitsch have tried in vain to limit the damage on saturday , zollitsch apologized personally for a cover-up of sexual abuse that happened 20 years ago while he was in charge of human resources and staffing in the freiburg diocese .

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .

elections for north rhine-westphalia are scheduled for may 9 .
the ruling coalition could lose to a far-left combination of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , greens and the left party .
north rhine-westphalia is currently governed by a coalition of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the same combination as the national government in berlin .
litmus test the regional election is merkel 's first electoral test since her center-right coalition took office nearly five months ago .
polls show voters are dissatisfied with the constant bickering within the center-right coalition government on a range of issues from fiscal policy , health reforms and nuclear power .
" the largest state must be governed soundly , as it ca n't be the location for ' experiments ' with uncertain conclusions , " merkel told a cdu party convention in the western city of muenster .

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .
to transcribe all of it or a part of it is considered a pious task - one that inspired people to create imaginative artwork over the centuries . in this way , richly-illustrated scripts came into existence , as well as painted tiles , inscriptions in stone , portable miniature guides to quran manuscripts , and delicately engraved mother of pearl shells and chestnut leaves .
many of these things have survived to this day . " apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?

it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .

a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change .

eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .

cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?

through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .

many of these things have survived to this day .

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .
to transcribe all of it or a part of it is considered a pious task - one that inspired people to create imaginative artwork over the centuries . in this way , richly-illustrated scripts came into existence , as well as painted tiles , inscriptions in stone , portable miniature guides to quran manuscripts , and delicately engraved mother of pearl shells and chestnut leaves .
many of these things have survived to this day . " apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations . " the military training assistance aims at strengthening relationships with other countries and thereby also teach democratic ideals .
that is a good thing .
it is military training , but from the basis of what we have in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
military cooperation with south africa south africa is one of the countries benefitting from military cooperation and assistance from germany .
captain lisa hendricks , south african defense attache to germany , told deutsche welle that " the training provided by germany has been invaluable to the south african defence forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african navy and the german navy carry out exercises germany and south africa have been involved in military cooperation for almost 19 years .
as part of the ongoing cooperation between the two nations , the south african air force , south african navy , and the german navy and german air force recently carried out the fourth installment of exercise good hope -lrb- exercise good hope iv -rrb- . according to the german information center pretoria , exercise good hope iv , which was held around cape town , included live missile and gun firings , anti-submarine warfare , anti-aircraft drills , fleet work and maneuvering .
the exercises were the largest undertaken by the german task force group outside of its nato obligations . when it all goes wrong but military cooperation does not always yield the desired results .
the example of guinea in west africa shows that the ideals of democracy and rule of law are not always successfully transmitted .
in september 2009 , german-trained paratroopers gained notoriety when they shot at peaceful demonstrators .
and in december 2008 , moussa dadis camara overthrew the government in what is sometimes called the " german coup . " his trademark was a red beret with a bronze eagle - the symbol for german paratroopers .
camara 's rule only lasted until december 3 , 2009 , when there was an assassination attempt on his life .
he was then replaced by his vice president , sekouba konate -lrb- a french-trained paratrooper -rrb- .
unlike his position as president of guinea , camara acquired his beret legitimately during his four-year training with the german armed forces .
like him , many other rebels were trained in germany ; including finance minister mamdou sande and security minister mamadouba camara .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinean junta leader , moussa dadis camara , in a german paramilitary beret as a result of the series of unfortunate events involving german-trained officers , germany has ended its cooperation with guinea .
the last soldiers will leave germany in february 2011 . thomas silberhorn said that the right decision had been made vis-a-vis guinea .
he supports training assistance in principle , but only as an instrument of democratization .
" the military training assistance should not contradict its goal of teaching democratic ideals , " he said . lack of transparency most of the criticism regarding military cooperation has to do with the lack of transparency of these programs : what is being taught and what does germany stand to gain ?
in the case of south africa , the country has purchased all its warships and submarines from germany in the last 10 years .
also , german defence personnel have had the opportunity to fire live missiles during exercises in south africa - something they can not do in their own country .
but no one at the german foreign ministry and defence ministry will comment on what qualifies an army to be a cooperation partner .
so , even the armies of ethiopia , nigeria , and the niger , which according to amnesty international 's mathias john commit human rights violations , receive training assistance . " a general statement from the german administration that it is improving human rights worldwide is not enough .
armed forces , security forces reform , justice and police reform are very important in many countries , " he said .
" there is a whole range of countries , where we do n't know exactly what can happen in the future , where the soldiers always continue to commit human rights violations .
so we ask ourselves on which criteria the federal government decides which training assistance to accomplish and to what extent the focus should be on human rights , " he added . author : martin heidelberger -lrb- cc -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations . " the military training assistance aims at strengthening relationships with other countries and thereby also teach democratic ideals .
that is a good thing .
it is military training , but from the basis of what we have in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
military cooperation with south africa south africa is one of the countries benefitting from military cooperation and assistance from germany .
captain lisa hendricks , south african defense attache to germany , told deutsche welle that " the training provided by germany has been invaluable to the south african defence forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african navy and the german navy carry out exercises germany and south africa have been involved in military cooperation for almost 19 years .
as part of the ongoing cooperation between the two nations , the south african air force , south african navy , and the german navy and german air force recently carried out the fourth installment of exercise good hope -lrb- exercise good hope iv -rrb- . according to the german information center pretoria , exercise good hope iv , which was held around cape town , included live missile and gun firings , anti-submarine warfare , anti-aircraft drills , fleet work and maneuvering .
the exercises were the largest undertaken by the german task force group outside of its nato obligations . when it all goes wrong but military cooperation does not always yield the desired results .
the example of guinea in west africa shows that the ideals of democracy and rule of law are not always successfully transmitted .
in september 2009 , german-trained paratroopers gained notoriety when they shot at peaceful demonstrators .
and in december 2008 , moussa dadis camara overthrew the government in what is sometimes called the " german coup . " his trademark was a red beret with a bronze eagle - the symbol for german paratroopers .
camara 's rule only lasted until december 3 , 2009 , when there was an assassination attempt on his life .
he was then replaced by his vice president , sekouba konate -lrb- a french-trained paratrooper -rrb- .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .

" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .

jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .

the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .

" apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .
junod himself hopes that many german muslims also visit the exhibition and feel proud of their heritage . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yes , we did have that , " he said , but denied allegations that he personally had suppressed information .
while most cases happened outside the church , " assaults that took place in such numbers within our institutions shame and frighten me , " zollitsch told focus .
" every single case darkens the face of the entire church , " he said .
zollitsch emphasized , however , that the church has been moving for years in the other direction to uncover and investigate reported cases of sexual abuse .
the archbishop was critical of proposals to file a complaint in every instance of suspected abuse .
he said many victims had told him explicitly that they did not desire legal action .
he stressed that it was also important to avoid baseless allegations which could ruin the lives of those falsely accused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and zollitsch have tried in vain to limit the damage on saturday , zollitsch apologized personally for a cover-up of sexual abuse that happened 20 years ago while he was in charge of human resources and staffing in the freiburg diocese .
victims disappointed by papal letter meanwhile , many abuse victims have expressed deep disappointment with the content of a pastoral letter published by pope benedict xvi on saturday .
victims in ireland , to whom the letter was addressed , said the pontiff had not accepted the responsibility of the vatican , nor did he recognize that there was a structural problem within the church .
" my first reaction was deep disappointment , " said maeve lewis from the one-in-four alliance .
catholics in the united states said the pope should have mentioned the extent of sexual abuse in numerous countries .

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations . " the military training assistance aims at strengthening relationships with other countries and thereby also teach democratic ideals .
that is a good thing .
it is military training , but from the basis of what we have in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
military cooperation with south africa south africa is one of the countries benefitting from military cooperation and assistance from germany .
captain lisa hendricks , south african defense attache to germany , told deutsche welle that " the training provided by germany has been invaluable to the south african defence forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african navy and the german navy carry out exercises germany and south africa have been involved in military cooperation for almost 19 years .
as part of the ongoing cooperation between the two nations , the south african air force , south african navy , and the german navy and german air force recently carried out the fourth installment of exercise good hope -lrb- exercise good hope iv -rrb- . according to the german information center pretoria , exercise good hope iv , which was held around cape town , included live missile and gun firings , anti-submarine warfare , anti-aircraft drills , fleet work and maneuvering .
the exercises were the largest undertaken by the german task force group outside of its nato obligations . when it all goes wrong but military cooperation does not always yield the desired results .
the example of guinea in west africa shows that the ideals of democracy and rule of law are not always successfully transmitted .
in september 2009 , german-trained paratroopers gained notoriety when they shot at peaceful demonstrators .
and in december 2008 , moussa dadis camara overthrew the government in what is sometimes called the " german coup . " his trademark was a red beret with a bronze eagle - the symbol for german paratroopers .
camara 's rule only lasted until december 3 , 2009 , when there was an assassination attempt on his life .
he was then replaced by his vice president , sekouba konate -lrb- a french-trained paratrooper -rrb- .
unlike his position as president of guinea , camara acquired his beret legitimately during his four-year training with the german armed forces .
like him , many other rebels were trained in germany ; including finance minister mamdou sande and security minister mamadouba camara .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinean junta leader , moussa dadis camara , in a german paramilitary beret as a result of the series of unfortunate events involving german-trained officers , germany has ended its cooperation with guinea .
the last soldiers will leave germany in february 2011 . thomas silberhorn said that the right decision had been made vis-a-vis guinea .
he supports training assistance in principle , but only as an instrument of democratization .
" the military training assistance should not contradict its goal of teaching democratic ideals , " he said . lack of transparency most of the criticism regarding military cooperation has to do with the lack of transparency of these programs : what is being taught and what does germany stand to gain ?
in the case of south africa , the country has purchased all its warships and submarines from germany in the last 10 years .
also , german defence personnel have had the opportunity to fire live missiles during exercises in south africa - something they can not do in their own country .
but no one at the german foreign ministry and defence ministry will comment on what qualifies an army to be a cooperation partner .
so , even the armies of ethiopia , nigeria , and the niger , which according to amnesty international 's mathias john commit human rights violations , receive training assistance . " a general statement from the german administration that it is improving human rights worldwide is not enough .
armed forces , security forces reform , justice and police reform are very important in many countries , " he said .
" there is a whole range of countries , where we do n't know exactly what can happen in the future , where the soldiers always continue to commit human rights violations .
so we ask ourselves on which criteria the federal government decides which training assistance to accomplish and to what extent the focus should be on human rights , " he added . author : martin heidelberger -lrb- cc -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" yes , we did have that , " he said , but denied allegations that he personally had suppressed information .
while most cases happened outside the church , " assaults that took place in such numbers within our institutions shame and frighten me , " zollitsch told focus .
" every single case darkens the face of the entire church , " he said .
zollitsch emphasized , however , that the church has been moving for years in the other direction to uncover and investigate reported cases of sexual abuse .
the archbishop was critical of proposals to file a complaint in every instance of suspected abuse .
he said many victims had told him explicitly that they did not desire legal action .
he stressed that it was also important to avoid baseless allegations which could ruin the lives of those falsely accused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and zollitsch have tried in vain to limit the damage on saturday , zollitsch apologized personally for a cover-up of sexual abuse that happened 20 years ago while he was in charge of human resources and staffing in the freiburg diocese .
victims disappointed by papal letter meanwhile , many abuse victims have expressed deep disappointment with the content of a pastoral letter published by pope benedict xvi on saturday .
victims in ireland , to whom the letter was addressed , said the pontiff had not accepted the responsibility of the vatican , nor did he recognize that there was a structural problem within the church .
" my first reaction was deep disappointment , " said maeve lewis from the one-in-four alliance .
catholics in the united states said the pope should have mentioned the extent of sexual abuse in numerous countries .

" indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .

many of these things have survived to this day .

each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de pressure mounts on eu states to bail out greece on the cusp of a european union summit in brussels , the eu commission president has notched up the pressure on member states to release funding for highly-indebted greece .
-lrb- 20.03.2010 -rrb- greece may look to imf for bailout greek prime minister george papandreou said thursday that his country may ask the imf for a bailout , a move which germany would support .
analysts , however , think athens is simply trying to provoke a concrete eu aid plan .

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?

it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .

the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment & development -pipe- 21.03.2010 german publishers asked to open a new chapter on world forest day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love to read , but rainforests are paying a high price a recent wwf study found many books printed for the german market contained paper sourced from rainforests in asia .
publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations . " the military training assistance aims at strengthening relationships with other countries and thereby also teach democratic ideals .
that is a good thing .
it is military training , but from the basis of what we have in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
military cooperation with south africa south africa is one of the countries benefitting from military cooperation and assistance from germany .
captain lisa hendricks , south african defense attache to germany , told deutsche welle that " the training provided by germany has been invaluable to the south african defence forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african navy and the german navy carry out exercises germany and south africa have been involved in military cooperation for almost 19 years .
as part of the ongoing cooperation between the two nations , the south african air force , south african navy , and the german navy and german air force recently carried out the fourth installment of exercise good hope -lrb- exercise good hope iv -rrb- . according to the german information center pretoria , exercise good hope iv , which was held around cape town , included live missile and gun firings , anti-submarine warfare , anti-aircraft drills , fleet work and maneuvering .
the exercises were the largest undertaken by the german task force group outside of its nato obligations . when it all goes wrong but military cooperation does not always yield the desired results .
the example of guinea in west africa shows that the ideals of democracy and rule of law are not always successfully transmitted .
in september 2009 , german-trained paratroopers gained notoriety when they shot at peaceful demonstrators .
and in december 2008 , moussa dadis camara overthrew the government in what is sometimes called the " german coup . " his trademark was a red beret with a bronze eagle - the symbol for german paratroopers .
camara 's rule only lasted until december 3 , 2009 , when there was an assassination attempt on his life .
he was then replaced by his vice president , sekouba konate -lrb- a french-trained paratrooper -rrb- .
unlike his position as president of guinea , camara acquired his beret legitimately during his four-year training with the german armed forces .
like him , many other rebels were trained in germany ; including finance minister mamdou sande and security minister mamadouba camara .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinean junta leader , moussa dadis camara , in a german paramilitary beret as a result of the series of unfortunate events involving german-trained officers , germany has ended its cooperation with guinea .
the last soldiers will leave germany in february 2011 . thomas silberhorn said that the right decision had been made vis-a-vis guinea .
he supports training assistance in principle , but only as an instrument of democratization .
" the military training assistance should not contradict its goal of teaching democratic ideals , " he said . lack of transparency most of the criticism regarding military cooperation has to do with the lack of transparency of these programs : what is being taught and what does germany stand to gain ?
in the case of south africa , the country has purchased all its warships and submarines from germany in the last 10 years .
also , german defence personnel have had the opportunity to fire live missiles during exercises in south africa - something they can not do in their own country .
but no one at the german foreign ministry and defence ministry will comment on what qualifies an army to be a cooperation partner .
so , even the armies of ethiopia , nigeria , and the niger , which according to amnesty international 's mathias john commit human rights violations , receive training assistance . " a general statement from the german administration that it is improving human rights worldwide is not enough .
armed forces , security forces reform , justice and police reform are very important in many countries , " he said .
" there is a whole range of countries , where we do n't know exactly what can happen in the future , where the soldiers always continue to commit human rights violations .
so we ask ourselves on which criteria the federal government decides which training assistance to accomplish and to what extent the focus should be on human rights , " he added . author : martin heidelberger -lrb- cc -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?

it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .

a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .

in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change .

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?

jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .

according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its organizers hope that it will arouse an interest in islamic culture and foster understanding between muslims and the western world . his royal highness aga khan iv - the spiritual leader of the shia imami ismaili muslims - owns one of the world 's largest and most precious collections of islamic art .
from 2013 , it will be housed in the new aga khan museum in toronto , but until then the collection is making its way around the world .
through june 6 , the artwork can be viewed at the martin-gropius-bau exhibition hall in berlin . the collection includes over 1,000 valuable works of islamic art from a period spanning a millennium .
some 200 pieces were carefully chosen to show in berlin , said luis monreal , director of the aga khan trust for culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an illustration form the story of " haftwad and the worm " originating from 16th-century iran first of all , they were chosen " to present some of the fundaments of islam : the value of the written word , the quran , and the importance of the pilgrimage to mecca , " explained monreal , " and secondly - and for me most importantly - to present to our western public the pluralism of the islamic cultures . " indeed , in the exhibition manual , aga khan iv writes that the alarming and dangerous tensions between the muslim world and the west make it necessary for both sides to make an effort to get to know each other better .
he says that a museum makes this possible in an imaginative and intelligent way .
after all , cultures manifest and express themselves in art . focus on the quran the exhibition makes it clear that the quran is the guiding light for the muslim way of life .
to transcribe all of it or a part of it is considered a pious task - one that inspired people to create imaginative artwork over the centuries . in this way , richly-illustrated scripts came into existence , as well as painted tiles , inscriptions in stone , portable miniature guides to quran manuscripts , and delicately engraved mother of pearl shells and chestnut leaves .
many of these things have survived to this day . " apart from the material on the quran , we grouped the rest of the elements to show the routes of travelers through the islamic world - travels which were sometimes hajj pilgrimages , but also adventures and discovery expeditions , " said benoit junod , the exhibition 's curator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the koran is at the center of muslim culture and art it also depicts the travels of traders , from one islamic dynasty to the next , and from cordoba on the iberian peninsula to morocco and tunisia , to egypt and syria , to constantinople and baghdad , delhi and turkmenistan .
each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations . " the military training assistance aims at strengthening relationships with other countries and thereby also teach democratic ideals .
that is a good thing .
it is military training , but from the basis of what we have in germany , " he told deutsche welle .

camara 's rule only lasted until december 3 , 2009 , when there was an assassination attempt on his life .
he was then replaced by his vice president , sekouba konate -lrb- a french-trained paratrooper -rrb- .

many of these things have survived to this day .

each of these regions had its own traditions and values that manifested themselves in the works of their artists . every object at the exhibition bears a unique history - such as , for example , " the canon of medicine " manuscript by avicenna , a persian physician , philosopher and scientist . " this manuscript had an influence on europe that we ca n't properly measure today , " said gereon sievernich , director of the martin-gropius-bau .
" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .

" but it ca n't be overestimated because , translated into latin , it was the handbook for european doctors for around 500 years . " according to junod , the exhibition 's organizers hope that western visitors return home with a feeling of curiosity about islam and the development of its civilization .
junod himself hopes that many german muslims also visit the exhibition and feel proud of their heritage . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .

according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations . " the military training assistance aims at strengthening relationships with other countries and thereby also teach democratic ideals .
that is a good thing .
it is military training , but from the basis of what we have in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
military cooperation with south africa south africa is one of the countries benefitting from military cooperation and assistance from germany .
captain lisa hendricks , south african defense attache to germany , told deutsche welle that " the training provided by germany has been invaluable to the south african defence forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african navy and the german navy carry out exercises germany and south africa have been involved in military cooperation for almost 19 years .
as part of the ongoing cooperation between the two nations , the south african air force , south african navy , and the german navy and german air force recently carried out the fourth installment of exercise good hope -lrb- exercise good hope iv -rrb- . according to the german information center pretoria , exercise good hope iv , which was held around cape town , included live missile and gun firings , anti-submarine warfare , anti-aircraft drills , fleet work and maneuvering .
the exercises were the largest undertaken by the german task force group outside of its nato obligations . when it all goes wrong but military cooperation does not always yield the desired results .
the example of guinea in west africa shows that the ideals of democracy and rule of law are not always successfully transmitted .
in september 2009 , german-trained paratroopers gained notoriety when they shot at peaceful demonstrators .
and in december 2008 , moussa dadis camara overthrew the government in what is sometimes called the " german coup . " his trademark was a red beret with a bronze eagle - the symbol for german paratroopers .
camara 's rule only lasted until december 3 , 2009 , when there was an assassination attempt on his life .
he was then replaced by his vice president , sekouba konate -lrb- a french-trained paratrooper -rrb- .
unlike his position as president of guinea , camara acquired his beret legitimately during his four-year training with the german armed forces .
like him , many other rebels were trained in germany ; including finance minister mamdou sande and security minister mamadouba camara .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guinean junta leader , moussa dadis camara , in a german paramilitary beret as a result of the series of unfortunate events involving german-trained officers , germany has ended its cooperation with guinea .
the last soldiers will leave germany in february 2011 . thomas silberhorn said that the right decision had been made vis-a-vis guinea .
he supports training assistance in principle , but only as an instrument of democratization .
" the military training assistance should not contradict its goal of teaching democratic ideals , " he said . lack of transparency most of the criticism regarding military cooperation has to do with the lack of transparency of these programs : what is being taught and what does germany stand to gain ?
in the case of south africa , the country has purchased all its warships and submarines from germany in the last 10 years .
also , german defence personnel have had the opportunity to fire live missiles during exercises in south africa - something they can not do in their own country .
but no one at the german foreign ministry and defence ministry will comment on what qualifies an army to be a cooperation partner .
so , even the armies of ethiopia , nigeria , and the niger , which according to amnesty international 's mathias john commit human rights violations , receive training assistance . " a general statement from the german administration that it is improving human rights worldwide is not enough .

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.03.2010 eu commissioners and germany at odds over urgency of helping greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eurozone offer what greece really needs ?
the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de pressure mounts on eu states to bail out greece on the cusp of a european union summit in brussels , the eu commission president has notched up the pressure on member states to release funding for highly-indebted greece .
-lrb- 20.03.2010 -rrb- greece may look to imf for bailout greek prime minister george papandreou said thursday that his country may ask the imf for a bailout , a move which germany would support .
analysts , however , think athens is simply trying to provoke a concrete eu aid plan .
-lrb- 18.03.2010 -rrb- europe 's continuing debt crisis highlights internal trade imbalances germany criticizes greece for spending too much money .
but this masks the role that german exports played in creating greek debt .

in recent years , german-trained soldiers staged a coup and shot at civilians in guinea . over the last decade , germany 's military cooperation with african countries has been organized and implemented by the foreign and defense ministries . in fact , the military training assistance program has trained defense personnel from 28 african countries and over 1,200 experts . defence spokesman thomas silberhorn of the christian social union says the military training strenghtens bilateral relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment & development -pipe- 21.03.2010 german publishers asked to open a new chapter on world forest day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love to read , but rainforests are paying a high price a recent wwf study found many books printed for the german market contained paper sourced from rainforests in asia .
publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while most cases happened outside the church , " assaults that took place in such numbers within our institutions shame and frighten me , " zollitsch told focus .
" every single case darkens the face of the entire church , " he said .
zollitsch emphasized , however , that the church has been moving for years in the other direction to uncover and investigate reported cases of sexual abuse .
the archbishop was critical of proposals to file a complaint in every instance of suspected abuse .
he said many victims had told him explicitly that they did not desire legal action .
he stressed that it was also important to avoid baseless allegations which could ruin the lives of those falsely accused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope and zollitsch have tried in vain to limit the damage on saturday , zollitsch apologized personally for a cover-up of sexual abuse that happened 20 years ago while he was in charge of human resources and staffing in the freiburg diocese .
victims disappointed by papal letter meanwhile , many abuse victims have expressed deep disappointment with the content of a pastoral letter published by pope benedict xvi on saturday .
victims in ireland , to whom the letter was addressed , said the pontiff had not accepted the responsibility of the vatican , nor did he recognize that there was a structural problem within the church .
" my first reaction was deep disappointment , " said maeve lewis from the one-in-four alliance .
catholics in the united states said the pope should have mentioned the extent of sexual abuse in numerous countries .
benedict also made no reference to the cases in germany , his home country. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elections for north rhine-westphalia are scheduled for may 9 .
the ruling coalition could lose to a far-left combination of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , greens and the left party .
north rhine-westphalia is currently governed by a coalition of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - the same combination as the national government in berlin .
litmus test the regional election is merkel 's first electoral test since her center-right coalition took office nearly five months ago .
polls show voters are dissatisfied with the constant bickering within the center-right coalition government on a range of issues from fiscal policy , health reforms and nuclear power .
" the largest state must be governed soundly , as it ca n't be the location for ' experiments ' with uncertain conclusions , " merkel told a cdu party convention in the western city of muenster .
" class struggle is yesterday 's thing , " merkel said .
" class struggle is not what will take us forward , " she added , in reference to the left party 's marxist rhetoric .
in parts the left party is a successor to the communist party of east germany .
the election outcome could affect the cdu 's majority in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament , where north rhine-westphalia 's 13.5 million voters could tip the balance of power if they voted the cdu out of office .
according to an opinion poll conducted by zdf tv channel , both the christian democrats and the social democrats would receive less votes than they did in regional elections five years ago .
the cdu has 37 percent , compared to 33 percent for the spd , the greens have 12 percent , the fdp 8 percent and the left party have 6 percent. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment & development -pipe- 21.03.2010 german publishers asked to open a new chapter on world forest day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love to read , but rainforests are paying a high price a recent wwf study found many books printed for the german market contained paper sourced from rainforests in asia .
publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment & development -pipe- 21.03.2010 german publishers asked to open a new chapter on world forest day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love to read , but rainforests are paying a high price a recent wwf study found many books printed for the german market contained paper sourced from rainforests in asia .
publishers who are trying to do the right thing are finding it more difficult than they imagined . germans are voracious readers .
more than a billion books were printed in europe 's largest book market in 2008 - most of them first editions .
that 's more than 10 books for every german .
but the good news for publishers is n't so great for the environment .
increasingly , books sold in germany are being produced in asia , where the paper is often sourced from virgin tropical rain forest .
" book production has changed , so that more and more books are being produced in , for example , china , " said nina griesshammer , a forest officer at the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- in frankfurt .
griesshammer says this outsourcing is a problem because suppliers in asia have different standards .
she says countries rich in natural rainforests like indonesia end up providing chinese manufacturers with their raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's ancient forests are falling victim to illegal logging " the potential that it comes from illegal logging is very high … in indonesia , for example , you have illegal logging rates of up to 70 percent , " she told deutsche welle .
the german branch of the wwf recently tested a number of german children 's books , and found that a staggering 40 percent contained significant traces of tropical wood that is only found in virgin forest .
that 's not just bad news for endangered species like orangutans , which are gradually being deprived of their habitat .
it 's also disappointing news for efforts to tackle climate change .
deforestation currently accounts for over 15 percent of humans ' contribution to greenhouse gases , and halting the loss of the world 's forests is a relatively straight forward way of reducing emissions .
according to the wwf , the only way for consumers to avoid colluding with forest destruction is to buy books printed on recycled paper or paper certified by the forest stewardship council -lrb- fsc -rrb- .
" fsc is a brand for ecological and socially friendly forest management which means that the forests are managed in a responsible way .
that means no clear cutting , no pesticides , special protection for animals and respect for the rights of indigenous people , " griesshammer said .
judging books by their covers griesshammer acknowledges that consumers have a difficult time when it comes to supporting eco-friendly publishing – the main motivation for buying a book is its content , not the paper it 's printed on .
she is confident that consumers could drive change - but are consumers asking ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the author of the ' harry potter ' series is working to ensure her books are eco-friendly paper the frankfurt branch of german book-chain hugendubel is the city 's biggest bookstore , with more than 1.5 million books in its catalogue .
it serves some 3,500 customers a day .
jens mueller , a staff member for more than 20 years , says he has never been asked about environmentally-friendly titles , but he adds that there 's an easy way for consumers to see if the book they 're interested in meets fsc criteria .
" there 's an imprint in every book , at the front or back which shows whether the book meets the standards of the forest stewardship council , and which publisher it is from , " mueller said .
eichborn , for example , is one of germany 's smaller book publishers , with sales of about 2.5 million books a year .
with only a few exceptions , all of eichborn 's books are printed on fsc certified paper .
cosima schneider from eichborn says the company approached this issue two years ago when it wanted to create " a new responsibility " for its products . " we asked ourselves how sustainably we could work , and then we started to look how ecological our suppliers were , and if they were certified , " she said .
shortage of certified paper initially , it was difficult for the company to find book printers who worked with forest-friendly paper , and the company had to move its production to sweden .
now , though , they are back in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : random house is aiming for all of its titles to be printed on fsc approved paper there are n't any reliable statistics about how many of germany 's 2,000 publishing houses use recycled or certified paper .
a quick random survey of 10 books in frankfurt 's hugendubel store showed that only two were printed on fsc paper .
the good news is that some of germany 's biggest book publishers are trying to lead the way .
the bad news is their suppliers ca n't keep up .
in 2006 , for example , the country 's largest publisher , random house germany , committed to using fsc paper for all its titles .
last year though , the company had to stop printing its mass market paperbacks on fsc paper , citing supply issues .
in 2009 , random house 's policy was to print only its hardback and trade paperbacks on fsc paper .
a company spokesman said last year that random house would have to review annually which of its editions could be printed using forest-friendly paper , but that its ambition was to reach the 100 percent target .
according to susanne reeh at eichborn , a lack of certified paper is a common problem facing other publishers who want to make the change . " paper manufacturers would like to produce more certified paper , but there is a lack of certified pulp on the market because demand is too high at the moment .
this means that even if publishers wanted to , they could n't get the paper , " she said author : kate hairsine / dc editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .
the eyjafjallajoekull volcano had been dormant since 1821 .
" there was little increased seismic activity prior to the eruption but we did note a few tremors around 2 on the richter scale - not enough to tell us that an eruption was about to start , " geophysicist steinunn jakobsdotter told local media. svs / ap / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no injuries or property damage have been reported .
the volcano began to spew smoke and lava from several craters alongside the country 's fifth largest glacier , eyjafjallajoekull , which is located about 120 kilometers east of the capital reykjavik .
authorities initially thought the eruption started underneath the glacier , which had raised fears about flooding caused by melting ice .
but scientists who were able to visit the area at daylight disproved this .
international flights passing over the island were diverted due to concerns about reduced visibility from smoke and ash .
other flights due to take off or land in iceland were canceled until monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.03.2010 eu commissioners and germany at odds over urgency of helping greece großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eurozone offer what greece really needs ?
the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of the 27 european union member states meet later this week to discuss long-term economic policy .
but the eu 's field of vision remains occupied by how to resolve greece 's financial predicament . although european union commissioners are pushing for quick action on some sort of rescue provisions for heavily indebted greece , germany is still disavowing the need for any such proposal - especially one that would dominate the agenda of the march 25-26 summit of eu heads of state .
" there 's no looming insolvency , " merkel told german broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
" i do n't believe that greece has any acute financial needs from the european community and that 's what the greek prime minister keeps telling me . "
but european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday that an eu standby aid package for greece should be assembled " as soon as possible . "
asking for a hand , or a handout ?
greece may not be asking for immediate loans from its fellow euro-zone members , but it is hoping they can offer some security that would allow them to borrow money at less than the interest rates it is currently being offered .
one way to do that is the establishment of a sort of contingency plan - offers of loans that can be redeemed if greece finds itself unable to make payments on those loans , despite draconian budget cuts the country approved recently .
eu commissioner for financial affairs olli rehn told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the commission " was ready to make a concrete proposal " for greece , one that would be connected to " strict " obligations . on sunday , merkel told german broadcasters that she would not oppose bilateral loans to greece to help it make debt payments , as proposed during a meeting of eu finance ministers last week .
" finance ministers should of course discuss among themselves " what should be done if a member state defaults on those loans , merkel said , " but no decision has been taken on that ...
that 's why i consider very explicitly that -lrb- the subject -rrb- remains open . "
however , rehn rejected the idea that there should be severe penalties for members whose deficits do n't meet eu standards , saying that prevention was more important .
' introverted ' germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn said the eu commission " was ready " to make a proposal for greece merkel had said last week that the euro zone should have a way to expel members that repeatedly broke its rules .
heavily indebted greece took offense , with the country 's deputy finance minister telling greek television on sunday that germany 's attitude threatened the currency union 's stability .
" germany is so introverted today that we would not even get a euro zone if we were to discuss its creation today , " said filippos sachinidis .
gustav horn , director of the macroeconomic policy institute in germany , told the afp news agency that merkel 's remark " reflects more the mood among the german population rather than a rational suggestion . "
the coalition led by merkel 's christian democratic union is behind in the polls ahead of an important regional election in north rhine-westphalia this may .
polls indicate that most germans oppose loaning money to greece .
but germany also saw itself the subject of a warning from rehn , who criticized it for a growing pile of public debt . " if germany does n't improve , there 's the danger that it will not meet the guideline that the 2013 national deficit be no higher than three percent of gross domestic product , " rehn said. svs / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
