one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .

they have n't got time .
what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .
given such prospects , it 's hardly surprising that the german government is eager to breathe new life into its economic relations with not only brazil , but 32 other countries in central and south america , as well as the caribbean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle announced that latin america will now occupy a ' central place ' within government policy in berlin " the whole south american continent is taking off , " westerwelle said as he presented his ministry 's 60-page strategy paper on wednesday to an audience that included ambassadors from latin american nations .
" despite many setbacks and difficulties , it is a singular success story , and we should be smart enough to take part . "
three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?
because they wo n't , " he said .
" as they grow and become more successful , they will also demand to have a greater say when it comes to important topics in global politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american countries such as argentina are among the world 's leading exporters of soya beans this year , latin america is expecting economic growth of more than 5 percent .
europe , on the other hand , will be lucky if it registers just 1 percent .
in order to profit from latin america 's boom , germany has long been providing political assistance to economic partnerships between companies .
those partnerships are reflected in the trade volume between germany and latin america , which reached 36.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 48.2 billion -rrb- in 2009 , up 16.3 percent from 2005 .
now though , berlin has discovered that the region can also serve as a valuable partner when it comes to resolving global issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , disarmament , and the war on terror .
" we do n't just share common economic interests with latin america , we also share common values , " westerwelle said .
" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .
strategy welcomed by diplomats , ngos the new strategy was welcomed by many of the latin american diplomats who attended the presentation at the foreign ministry .
" we now have the opportunity to reestablish a historic bond , " said argentina 's ambassador , guillermo nielsen .
" at the start of the last century , our most important market for exports was germany , but in the postwar era , this relationship was lost .
now it 's coming back . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .
" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .
" i would like to know more about how the strategy paper defines sustainability - a term that is used quite frequently , " said hein broetz , latin american expert at misereor .
" indigenous people -lrb- in latin america -rrb- are often driven from their land to make way for large infrastructure and natural resource projects , and i was expecting the government to make a clearer statement as to where it stands . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.08.2010 german agency warns of security loopholes in apple mobile devices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphone users may not be able to smile away their security concerns a german agency has warned of potentially serious security problems in several versions of apple 's iphone , ipad , and ipod touch devices .
apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .

many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.08.2010 german agency warns of security loopholes in apple mobile devices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphone users may not be able to smile away their security concerns a german agency has warned of potentially serious security problems in several versions of apple 's iphone , ipad , and ipod touch devices .
apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .

" both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .

it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

at least 50 people have been killed in the blazes , which look set to continue . chancellor angela merkel offered to help russian efforts to put out hundreds of wildfires in a telephone conversation with president dmitry medvedev late on wednesday .
merkel expressed " solidarity and the german readiness to help in the face of the devastating fires , " according to a german government statement .
the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .
military blaze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires have led to high levels of smog in moscow president medvedev has issued official warnings to russia 's top two naval commanders and sacked a number of high-ranking officers , after they failed to prevent one of the fires spreading to a military base last week .
the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "
meanwhile , firefighters outside moscow are struggling to keep the blazes clear of the country 's top secret nuclear research facility in sarov , a city foreigners can not enter .
an unnamed official is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as saying " the situation is under control . "

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .

despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .

however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .

the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .

"
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?

if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

he believes the piano is a rare model once played by wolfgang amadeus mozart . experts now believe a fortepiano in southern germany may be a long-sought model played by wolfgang amadeus mozart during the composer 's stays in strasbourg .
the instrument currently belongs to piano maker martin becker , who purchased the piano around 25 years ago from an antique dealer in strasbourg .
he recently offered the instrument for sale .
" somehow i came upon the idea of auctioning it on ebay and had a price in mind of around 30,000 to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,500 to $ 53,000 -rrb- , " becker told german radio broadcaster swr .
instead , the piano may be worth more than a hundred times its original asking price , and becker has adjusted its listing online to five million euros .
the fortepiano - an early version of the modern piano - was built in 1775 and is likely one of just eight models known to be have been made by a piano maker from zweibruecken named christian baumann .
experts are currently examining the piano 's history .
with help from a painting the night after auctioning the piano and failing to get bids at his original price , becker said he was contacted by music historian andreas beuermann , who told becker that mozart may have once performed using the instrument .
beuermann recognized the piano from an historical oil painting hanging in vienna , in which joseph haydn is shown playing what may be the exact same instrument .
music historians have long searched for the eighth piano built by baumann , which mozart mentioned in letters to his father .
the fortepiano , developed around the turn of the 18th century , differs from the modern piano in that it has a much lighter frame and smaller dynamic range .
mozart , haydn and beethoven all composed for the fortepiano , which was designed for smaller settings rather than large concert halls .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .

carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .

since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .

" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "

" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 05.08.2010 medvedev 's expansion of security powers sparks fears of a crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law could be used to silence critics of the kremlin faced with a simmering , underground opposition , russian president dmitry medvedev has expanded the powers of the country 's federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- in a move which critics have called a " danger to society . " medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said . " what is more important is that a decrease in the popular support for the duo does not increase the numbers for the opposition , so there is no real political alternative to the current leadership - and the leadership knows it .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

they have n't got time .
what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .
given such prospects , it 's hardly surprising that the german government is eager to breathe new life into its economic relations with not only brazil , but 32 other countries in central and south america , as well as the caribbean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle announced that latin america will now occupy a ' central place ' within government policy in berlin " the whole south american continent is taking off , " westerwelle said as he presented his ministry 's 60-page strategy paper on wednesday to an audience that included ambassadors from latin american nations .
" despite many setbacks and difficulties , it is a singular success story , and we should be smart enough to take part . "
three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?
because they wo n't , " he said .
" as they grow and become more successful , they will also demand to have a greater say when it comes to important topics in global politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american countries such as argentina are among the world 's leading exporters of soya beans this year , latin america is expecting economic growth of more than 5 percent .
europe , on the other hand , will be lucky if it registers just 1 percent .
in order to profit from latin america 's boom , germany has long been providing political assistance to economic partnerships between companies .
those partnerships are reflected in the trade volume between germany and latin america , which reached 36.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 48.2 billion -rrb- in 2009 , up 16.3 percent from 2005 .
now though , berlin has discovered that the region can also serve as a valuable partner when it comes to resolving global issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , disarmament , and the war on terror .
" we do n't just share common economic interests with latin america , we also share common values , " westerwelle said .
" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .
strategy welcomed by diplomats , ngos the new strategy was welcomed by many of the latin american diplomats who attended the presentation at the foreign ministry .
" we now have the opportunity to reestablish a historic bond , " said argentina 's ambassador , guillermo nielsen .
" at the start of the last century , our most important market for exports was germany , but in the postwar era , this relationship was lost .
now it 's coming back . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .
" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .
" i would like to know more about how the strategy paper defines sustainability - a term that is used quite frequently , " said hein broetz , latin american expert at misereor .
" indigenous people -lrb- in latin america -rrb- are often driven from their land to make way for large infrastructure and natural resource projects , and i was expecting the government to make a clearer statement as to where it stands . "

the bank allegedly encouraged investors to bet against the same mortgages it was financing . deutsche bank has found itself under scrutiny by the us securities exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , just one month after goldman sachs settled fraud allegations for $ 550 million -lrb- 417 million euros -rrb- , and one week after citigroup agreed to pay a $ 75 million settlement .
the wall street journal reported tuesday that deutsche bank is one of several financial institutions being examined by the sec amid allegations it encouraged investment in the housing market while betting on its imminent collapse .
a deutsche bank trader created an index in 2006 to make betting against subprime home loans easier , and actively encouraged clients to do so .
at the same time , the bank was financing subprime lenders on the brink of collapse , such as the now-defunct novastar financial .
own money used the bank also used its own money to make tens of millions of dollars from short bets in the housing market .
however , it told the wall street journal that it " maintained a net long position in the housing market and ultimately suffered billions in losses , even after factoring in our hedges and offsetting positions . "
federal money was later used bail out the american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- , which had insured volatile deutsche bank mortgage securities .
deutsche bank recently agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to the financial industry regulatory authority , but neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .
it is also fighting a fraud-and-misrepresentation lawsuit against m & t bank in a new york state court .
m & t lost 98 percent of an $ 82 million investment in a deutsche bank deal over a period of 10 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2010 st. pauli secure surprise bundesliga win , but only for fashion sense großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli are top of the table , at least in terms of style bundesliga soccer is still a fortnight away , but this season 's fashion champions have already been named .
and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said . " what is more important is that a decrease in the popular support for the duo does not increase the numbers for the opposition , so there is no real political alternative to the current leadership - and the leadership knows it .

the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said . " what is more important is that a decrease in the popular support for the duo does not increase the numbers for the opposition , so there is no real political alternative to the current leadership - and the leadership knows it .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.08.2010 german agency warns of security loopholes in apple mobile devices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphone users may not be able to smile away their security concerns a german agency has warned of potentially serious security problems in several versions of apple 's iphone , ipad , and ipod touch devices .
apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .

thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .

" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

the bank allegedly encouraged investors to bet against the same mortgages it was financing . deutsche bank has found itself under scrutiny by the us securities exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , just one month after goldman sachs settled fraud allegations for $ 550 million -lrb- 417 million euros -rrb- , and one week after citigroup agreed to pay a $ 75 million settlement .
the wall street journal reported tuesday that deutsche bank is one of several financial institutions being examined by the sec amid allegations it encouraged investment in the housing market while betting on its imminent collapse .
a deutsche bank trader created an index in 2006 to make betting against subprime home loans easier , and actively encouraged clients to do so .
at the same time , the bank was financing subprime lenders on the brink of collapse , such as the now-defunct novastar financial .
own money used the bank also used its own money to make tens of millions of dollars from short bets in the housing market .
however , it told the wall street journal that it " maintained a net long position in the housing market and ultimately suffered billions in losses , even after factoring in our hedges and offsetting positions . "
federal money was later used bail out the american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- , which had insured volatile deutsche bank mortgage securities .
deutsche bank recently agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to the financial industry regulatory authority , but neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .
it is also fighting a fraud-and-misrepresentation lawsuit against m & t bank in a new york state court .
m & t lost 98 percent of an $ 82 million investment in a deutsche bank deal over a period of 10 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy .

at least 50 people have been killed in the blazes , which look set to continue . chancellor angela merkel offered to help russian efforts to put out hundreds of wildfires in a telephone conversation with president dmitry medvedev late on wednesday .
merkel expressed " solidarity and the german readiness to help in the face of the devastating fires , " according to a german government statement .
the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .
military blaze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires have led to high levels of smog in moscow president medvedev has issued official warnings to russia 's top two naval commanders and sacked a number of high-ranking officers , after they failed to prevent one of the fires spreading to a military base last week .
the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "
meanwhile , firefighters outside moscow are struggling to keep the blazes clear of the country 's top secret nuclear research facility in sarov , a city foreigners can not enter .
an unnamed official is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as saying " the situation is under control . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.08.2010 german agency warns of security loopholes in apple mobile devices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphone users may not be able to smile away their security concerns a german agency has warned of potentially serious security problems in several versions of apple 's iphone , ipad , and ipod touch devices .
apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.08.2010 german economy bounces back , boosting optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are feeling good about the economy these days the german economy is riding high , with a wave of positive indicators and good quarterly results boosting overall optimism .
but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.08.2010 german economy bounces back , boosting optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are feeling good about the economy these days the german economy is riding high , with a wave of positive indicators and good quarterly results boosting overall optimism .
but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2010 st. pauli secure surprise bundesliga win , but only for fashion sense großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli are top of the table , at least in terms of style bundesliga soccer is still a fortnight away , but this season 's fashion champions have already been named .
and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2010 st. pauli secure surprise bundesliga win , but only for fashion sense großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli are top of the table , at least in terms of style bundesliga soccer is still a fortnight away , but this season 's fashion champions have already been named .
and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.08.2010 german economy bounces back , boosting optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are feeling good about the economy these days the german economy is riding high , with a wave of positive indicators and good quarterly results boosting overall optimism .
but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.08.2010 german agency warns of security loopholes in apple mobile devices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphone users may not be able to smile away their security concerns a german agency has warned of potentially serious security problems in several versions of apple 's iphone , ipad , and ipod touch devices .
apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .

at least 50 people have been killed in the blazes , which look set to continue . chancellor angela merkel offered to help russian efforts to put out hundreds of wildfires in a telephone conversation with president dmitry medvedev late on wednesday .
merkel expressed " solidarity and the german readiness to help in the face of the devastating fires , " according to a german government statement .
the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .
military blaze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires have led to high levels of smog in moscow president medvedev has issued official warnings to russia 's top two naval commanders and sacked a number of high-ranking officers , after they failed to prevent one of the fires spreading to a military base last week .
the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "

an unnamed official is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as saying " the situation is under control . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 05.08.2010 medvedev 's expansion of security powers sparks fears of a crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law could be used to silence critics of the kremlin faced with a simmering , underground opposition , russian president dmitry medvedev has expanded the powers of the country 's federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- in a move which critics have called a " danger to society . " medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said . " what is more important is that a decrease in the popular support for the duo does not increase the numbers for the opposition , so there is no real political alternative to the current leadership - and the leadership knows it .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .

" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .

" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .

at the same time , the bank was financing subprime lenders on the brink of collapse , such as the now-defunct novastar financial .
own money used the bank also used its own money to make tens of millions of dollars from short bets in the housing market .
however , it told the wall street journal that it " maintained a net long position in the housing market and ultimately suffered billions in losses , even after factoring in our hedges and offsetting positions . "
federal money was later used bail out the american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- , which had insured volatile deutsche bank mortgage securities .
deutsche bank recently agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to the financial industry regulatory authority , but neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .
it is also fighting a fraud-and-misrepresentation lawsuit against m & t bank in a new york state court .
m & t lost 98 percent of an $ 82 million investment in a deutsche bank deal over a period of 10 months .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "

if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .

" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .

" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .

and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2010 st. pauli secure surprise bundesliga win , but only for fashion sense großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli are top of the table , at least in terms of style bundesliga soccer is still a fortnight away , but this season 's fashion champions have already been named .
and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .

the bank allegedly encouraged investors to bet against the same mortgages it was financing . deutsche bank has found itself under scrutiny by the us securities exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , just one month after goldman sachs settled fraud allegations for $ 550 million -lrb- 417 million euros -rrb- , and one week after citigroup agreed to pay a $ 75 million settlement .
the wall street journal reported tuesday that deutsche bank is one of several financial institutions being examined by the sec amid allegations it encouraged investment in the housing market while betting on its imminent collapse .

what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .

three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?

" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .

" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .
" our overall assessment is that the program has made a strong start . "
greece must now push through reforms in energy , banking and the public sector , the inspection team said .
loan a near-certainty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of prime minister george papandreou has been under pressure to cut debt commenting on the assessment by the international inspectors , ecb president jean-claude trichet told a news conference in frankfurt , " it does n't mean that a very hard job should not continue to be done . "
the visit came ahead of the release of the second portion of a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 145 billion -rrb- loan to greece from the european union and the imf . payment was somewhat dependent on the athens government 's progress in curbing its massive budget deficit .
" we would expect , on the basis on that -lrb- positive assessment -rrb- , that the disbursement would take place on schedule in september , " said thomsen .
deutsche welle athens correspondent jannis papadimitriou said greece thinks it deserves to receive the loan .
" today , finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou was more than confident .
he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .
that is , in less than four months , " papadimitiriou said .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 05.08.2010 medvedev 's expansion of security powers sparks fears of a crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law could be used to silence critics of the kremlin faced with a simmering , underground opposition , russian president dmitry medvedev has expanded the powers of the country 's federal security service -lrb- fsb -rrb- in a move which critics have called a " danger to society . " medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said . " what is more important is that a decrease in the popular support for the duo does not increase the numbers for the opposition , so there is no real political alternative to the current leadership - and the leadership knows it .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

at least 50 people have been killed in the blazes , which look set to continue . chancellor angela merkel offered to help russian efforts to put out hundreds of wildfires in a telephone conversation with president dmitry medvedev late on wednesday .
merkel expressed " solidarity and the german readiness to help in the face of the devastating fires , " according to a german government statement .
the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .

the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "

the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .

the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "

an unnamed official is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as saying " the situation is under control . "

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "

his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .

club president asare bediako brempong and his fellow members meet regularly to listen to deutsche welle programmes .
in his latest club report asare informed us : “ we have weekly discussions of events in germany and europe , e.g. the new discovery of gas in poland and its benefits to eu as well as talks with the staff of a senior high school on events in africa today .

shivendu paul also went on to write : “ we listen to various programmes from different international radio stations , analysing the contents and creativity and we pass on our findings to the broadcasters in question .
we hold a dx meeting each month and carry out social activities .
we celebrated the 150th birth date of the poet rabindranath tagore with a cultural programme .
around 150 people joined in and local children as well as our coaching centre students participated by reciting the poems and singing the songs of that noble poet . ” mrefe akpotu of the dw listeners ’ club in warri , delta state / nigeria continues to mail us , letting us know that he and his fellow members are doing quite well and that club activities are moving on smoothly . ”
mrefe also wrote : “ we have opened up a new chapter monitoring what the papers say about our area being the heart beat of the restive niger delta region of nigeria .
and we have a mouthful of slips and details to pass on to our people .
the main aim of this venture is just to sensitize them on the need to watch out for underground plans to make the area unsafe . we also collate details from various shortwave stations and satellite tv using our various cable connections and dishes . ” jaisakthivel , president of the ardic dx club in terunelveli , tamil nadu , india , informed us that he has been made assistant professor in the department of communication at the manonmaniam sundaranar university and we congratulate him on his new post .

we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .

the club also organizes blood donations when the government blood bank is not in a position to do so , making sure that children suffering from thalassemia receive blood transfusions when necessary . members are also working together with the murshidabad eye care and donation society in connection with cornea replacement .
shivendu paul also went on to write : “ we listen to various programmes from different international radio stations , analysing the contents and creativity and we pass on our findings to the broadcasters in question .
we hold a dx meeting each month and carry out social activities .

members are writing the script for the skit .
we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .
if we are successful , we will have saved lives thereby contributing to progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals .
in india , for example , this means 250,000 neonates can be saved from death annually by just this one act .
initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is thus the first and most vital step towards reducing infant and under-five mortality . ” the last club in this month ’ s club corner is the deutsche welle listeners ’ club in gboko / benue state , nigeria .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 05.08.2010 launching a new strategy for latin america , germany promises a relationship of equals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american cities such as sao paolo are taking on a new , global profile the german government has presented a new strategy for latin america that , according to foreign minister guido westerwelle , takes into account the region 's growing economic and political significance . in brazil , it seems , no one is brooding about the effects of the global economic crisis .
they have n't got time .
what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .
given such prospects , it 's hardly surprising that the german government is eager to breathe new life into its economic relations with not only brazil , but 32 other countries in central and south america , as well as the caribbean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle announced that latin america will now occupy a ' central place ' within government policy in berlin " the whole south american continent is taking off , " westerwelle said as he presented his ministry 's 60-page strategy paper on wednesday to an audience that included ambassadors from latin american nations .
" despite many setbacks and difficulties , it is a singular success story , and we should be smart enough to take part . "
three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?
because they wo n't , " he said .
" as they grow and become more successful , they will also demand to have a greater say when it comes to important topics in global politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american countries such as argentina are among the world 's leading exporters of soya beans this year , latin america is expecting economic growth of more than 5 percent .
europe , on the other hand , will be lucky if it registers just 1 percent .
in order to profit from latin america 's boom , germany has long been providing political assistance to economic partnerships between companies .
those partnerships are reflected in the trade volume between germany and latin america , which reached 36.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 48.2 billion -rrb- in 2009 , up 16.3 percent from 2005 .
now though , berlin has discovered that the region can also serve as a valuable partner when it comes to resolving global issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , disarmament , and the war on terror .
" we do n't just share common economic interests with latin america , we also share common values , " westerwelle said .
" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .
strategy welcomed by diplomats , ngos the new strategy was welcomed by many of the latin american diplomats who attended the presentation at the foreign ministry .
" we now have the opportunity to reestablish a historic bond , " said argentina 's ambassador , guillermo nielsen .
" at the start of the last century , our most important market for exports was germany , but in the postwar era , this relationship was lost .
now it 's coming back . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .
" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .
" i would like to know more about how the strategy paper defines sustainability - a term that is used quite frequently , " said hein broetz , latin american expert at misereor .
" indigenous people -lrb- in latin america -rrb- are often driven from their land to make way for large infrastructure and natural resource projects , and i was expecting the government to make a clearer statement as to where it stands . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.08.2010 german agency warns of security loopholes in apple mobile devices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iphone users may not be able to smile away their security concerns a german agency has warned of potentially serious security problems in several versions of apple 's iphone , ipad , and ipod touch devices .
apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

she 's claimed that taylor gave her a large , rough diamond at a dinner party in south africa in 1997 .
that diamond is allegedly linked to the civil war in sierra leone .
taylor stands accused of arming rebels in return for illegally mined diamonds . elly harrowell is a campaigner at the london-based organization global witness , which investigates and publicizes links between the exploitation of natural resources and conflict and corruption .
she spoke to deutsche welle about why blood diamonds are still a pressing issue and why it has taken a celebrity for the world to pay attention . deutsche welle : has naomi campbell 's scheduled appearance in charles taylor 's trial next week helped refocus global attention on conflict or blood diamonds ? elly harrowell : yes absolutely , i think it 's a little sad in a way that we need the input of a celebrity such as naomi campbell in order to focus people 's minds on the issue of conflict diamonds .
but what it has done that is quite positive is get people talking about an issue that many people seem to think has fallen away in recent years .
the question of conflict diamonds is still very much a live question , one that continues to rear its ugly head in a number of places .
so i 'm certainly glad that this is back on the front pages , so that we can keep pushing to find a resolution to the problem . campaigners like your group have been trying over the years to keep this issue alive , why do you think it keeps slipping off the radar ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell -lrb- right -rrb- is set to testify at the trial of former liberian president charles taylor i think there have been a few relatively quiet years in terms of conflict diamonds .
after the horrific wars that we saw in west africa , in angola as well , that brought conflict diamonds to the fore .
after they had ended , there were n't quite so many real classic conflict diamond wars in the news anymore , that is until the issue of zimbabwe came to the forefront in the last couple of years where we 've seen , unfortunately once again , quite horrific violence associated with the diamond trade . there 's also the question of the cote d 'ivoire .
cote d 'ivoire remains the only country in the world whose diamonds are under un sanctions at the moment .
that 's because they had a long rebel war where the north and south of the country were split , and in effect all of the diamond-producing areas are found in the north of the country , and under the control of the groups .
elsewhere , there are still concerns , and we hear periodic reports of human rights abuses in the diamond trade in , for example , angola , and we also have countries such as venezuela where the implementation of the kimberley process is very weak and problematic and we see real rampant diamond smuggling . the kimberley process is a system that participating countries have signed up to trace the diamond from the mine to the polishing stage .
this has to do with rough diamonds of course .
where are we at currently in this process ? the kimberley process has been enforced since 2003 , so it 's had seven years now to prove its worth .
i think it 's fair to say that it 's had a few achievements .
the existence of the kimberley process is in itself an achievement .
it was quite pioneering in the way that it brought together governments , industry and civil society to work together to address the issue of conflict diamonds , and in some of the countries where we saw real conflict diamond problems , the kimberley process has helped to push up official diamond revenue , which takes the revenue out of the hands of armed groups and into the state coffers and pushes development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kimberley process regulators recently allowed zimbabwe to resume some diamond exports so it does have a lot of potential to do good and to prevent conflict diamond issues , however it 's not really achieving that full potential at the moment .
we 've talked about some of the problem cases that still exist - in venezuela , cote d 'ivoire , zimbabwe - and there 's also a real need for the kimberley process to be reformed , in order that it can really effectively face some of the challenges it faces today . global witness has been calling for increased supervision of the industry by governments in participating countries .
is that part of the reforms you were referring to ? it is , there 's a number of reforms we think are really quite crucial .
for example , we think the kimberley process should reiterate and strengthen its commitment to protecting human rights .
we feel that 's really at the heart of the kimberley process , the reason we set it up in the first place was to protect from harm those communities involved in diamond mining .
we also think that governments and industry should agree to set up some sort of secretariat for the kp .
you might be quite surprised to know that we 're talking about a system that brings together 75 countries and yet it does n't have a permanent secretariat yet .
it does n't have one dollar of funding .
and there are other issues that we feel really need to be reformed , such as improving the decision-making process , set a defining standard , improving the practices on peer review and so on at the heart of the kp - all of these reforms will need governments to stand up and be counted in order to be implemented . blood diamonds or conflict diamonds - the term generally refers to diamonds that are used to fuel conflicts , even fund conflicts - and sounds quite dramatic .
give us some sense of exactly the nature of oppression or violence that 's unleashed on people who are caught up in these sorts of situations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands in sierra leone suffered amputations during the country 's civil war well you 've taken a very interesting question here actually , because the definition of conflict diamonds themselves can be quite problematic .
the classical definition that the kimberley process uses is diamonds that are used by rebel groups to fuel armed conflicts against legitimate governments .
that 's the kind of thing we saw for example in sierra leone , where rebel groups were forcing local communities to mine for diamonds in order to buy more arms .
we saw terrible abuse against local people : murders , amputations and so on .
the issues we 're seeing today , for example in zimbabwe , are slightly different because here we 're talking not about rebel groups forcing people to mine and abusing people but actually government groups , the armed forces , even police , who are committing many of the same acts : forced labor , rape , murder , beatings of local people , but this time not by a rebel group but by a recognized government force . which leads us back to the charles taylor trial .
some experts have said that the scope of this trial goes far beyond the taylor case itself and the appearance or not of a star like naomi campbell , but it takes us to the issue of heads of state abusing their citizens , and that these leaders could later find themselves in the dock over the issue . yes , absolutely .
i think that the charles taylor trial is quite trailblazing in this way , it will send a message - a very strong message - to leaders of countries that , actually , this kind of behavior will not be tolerated by the international community .
that we will come after them , as it were , to hold them accountable for any abuse committed against their citizens .
and i think that 's a very positive and strong message to be sending out at this time . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam -lrb- skt -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's claimed that taylor gave her a large , rough diamond at a dinner party in south africa in 1997 .
that diamond is allegedly linked to the civil war in sierra leone .
taylor stands accused of arming rebels in return for illegally mined diamonds . elly harrowell is a campaigner at the london-based organization global witness , which investigates and publicizes links between the exploitation of natural resources and conflict and corruption .
she spoke to deutsche welle about why blood diamonds are still a pressing issue and why it has taken a celebrity for the world to pay attention . deutsche welle : has naomi campbell 's scheduled appearance in charles taylor 's trial next week helped refocus global attention on conflict or blood diamonds ? elly harrowell : yes absolutely , i think it 's a little sad in a way that we need the input of a celebrity such as naomi campbell in order to focus people 's minds on the issue of conflict diamonds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.08.2010 german expellee groups reassert their history as charter turns 60 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the war germans were expelled from many countries critics have questioned the role of ethnic german expellee communities forced to leave their homes after world war ii .
as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

most of our club members participated and some of the all india radio technical department staff also joined us .
the first august week is the world breast feeding week .
for that our club plans to organize a public awareness campaign in tirunelveli .
members are writing the script for the skit .
we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .
if we are successful , we will have saved lives thereby contributing to progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals .
in india , for example , this means 250,000 neonates can be saved from death annually by just this one act .
initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is thus the first and most vital step towards reducing infant and under-five mortality . ” the last club in this month ’ s club corner is the deutsche welle listeners ’ club in gboko / benue state , nigeria .
club president tanko b. marbo , informed us of their last general meeting , which was attended by 27 members and he had this to add : “ concerning dw programmes , club members still commend the superb quality of dw-radio programmes and their presentation .
top of the list includes newslink , inside europe , pulse , art on the air , world in progress , sports report , inbox and spectrum . we have not given up on our adult literacy classes , basic health care or enlightenment and income-generation skills- acquisition programmes . ” as usual , many thanks to all club members who manage to put in so much time caring for others as well as listening to our programs , discussing them with fellow members - and contacting us .
well done and keep up the good work . we would like to mention the fact that , here at the english service , all active clubs are considered to be part of our deutsche welle family – and all are appreciated by us .

and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

at least 50 people have been killed in the blazes , which look set to continue . chancellor angela merkel offered to help russian efforts to put out hundreds of wildfires in a telephone conversation with president dmitry medvedev late on wednesday .
merkel expressed " solidarity and the german readiness to help in the face of the devastating fires , " according to a german government statement .
the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .
military blaze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires have led to high levels of smog in moscow president medvedev has issued official warnings to russia 's top two naval commanders and sacked a number of high-ranking officers , after they failed to prevent one of the fires spreading to a military base last week .
the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "
meanwhile , firefighters outside moscow are struggling to keep the blazes clear of the country 's top secret nuclear research facility in sarov , a city foreigners can not enter .
an unnamed official is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as saying " the situation is under control . "

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

one official said he was confident athens would now receive the next instalment of a rescue package . a team of international inspectors has given greece the thumbs up over its government 's efforts to counteract the country 's debt crisis .
the assessors also said , however , that important reforms still needed to be enacted .
the mostly positive assessment was made by officials from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and the european commission who had been in greece for two weeks .
the financial fact-finding mission reported that greece would likely meet this year 's deficit-cutting target .
" this was a very ambitious program with a lot of front-loading , and the good news is that it is being implemented as agreed , " the imf 's mission chief , poul thomsen , told news agency reuters .
a joint statement by the eu commission , imf and ecb said the " performance criteria have all been met , led by a vigorous implementation of the fiscal program and important reforms are ahead of schedule .

he said that in the last 50 years , no greek government has ever promoted so many reforms in such a short period of time .

they have n't got time .
what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .
given such prospects , it 's hardly surprising that the german government is eager to breathe new life into its economic relations with not only brazil , but 32 other countries in central and south america , as well as the caribbean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle announced that latin america will now occupy a ' central place ' within government policy in berlin " the whole south american continent is taking off , " westerwelle said as he presented his ministry 's 60-page strategy paper on wednesday to an audience that included ambassadors from latin american nations .
" despite many setbacks and difficulties , it is a singular success story , and we should be smart enough to take part . "
three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?
because they wo n't , " he said .
" as they grow and become more successful , they will also demand to have a greater say when it comes to important topics in global politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american countries such as argentina are among the world 's leading exporters of soya beans this year , latin america is expecting economic growth of more than 5 percent .
europe , on the other hand , will be lucky if it registers just 1 percent .
in order to profit from latin america 's boom , germany has long been providing political assistance to economic partnerships between companies .
those partnerships are reflected in the trade volume between germany and latin america , which reached 36.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 48.2 billion -rrb- in 2009 , up 16.3 percent from 2005 .
now though , berlin has discovered that the region can also serve as a valuable partner when it comes to resolving global issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , disarmament , and the war on terror .
" we do n't just share common economic interests with latin america , we also share common values , " westerwelle said .
" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .
strategy welcomed by diplomats , ngos the new strategy was welcomed by many of the latin american diplomats who attended the presentation at the foreign ministry .
" we now have the opportunity to reestablish a historic bond , " said argentina 's ambassador , guillermo nielsen .
" at the start of the last century , our most important market for exports was germany , but in the postwar era , this relationship was lost .
now it 's coming back . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .
" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .
" i would like to know more about how the strategy paper defines sustainability - a term that is used quite frequently , " said hein broetz , latin american expert at misereor .
" indigenous people -lrb- in latin america -rrb- are often driven from their land to make way for large infrastructure and natural resource projects , and i was expecting the government to make a clearer statement as to where it stands . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

the bank allegedly encouraged investors to bet against the same mortgages it was financing . deutsche bank has found itself under scrutiny by the us securities exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , just one month after goldman sachs settled fraud allegations for $ 550 million -lrb- 417 million euros -rrb- , and one week after citigroup agreed to pay a $ 75 million settlement .
the wall street journal reported tuesday that deutsche bank is one of several financial institutions being examined by the sec amid allegations it encouraged investment in the housing market while betting on its imminent collapse .
a deutsche bank trader created an index in 2006 to make betting against subprime home loans easier , and actively encouraged clients to do so .
at the same time , the bank was financing subprime lenders on the brink of collapse , such as the now-defunct novastar financial .

however , it told the wall street journal that it " maintained a net long position in the housing market and ultimately suffered billions in losses , even after factoring in our hedges and offsetting positions . "
federal money was later used bail out the american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- , which had insured volatile deutsche bank mortgage securities .
deutsche bank recently agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to the financial industry regulatory authority , but neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

some 500,000 people die each year from toxic smoke emitted by traditional stoves .
modern stoves can reduce emissions and health risks . ammukutty gopalakrishnan lights a traditional ' chulha ' in her soot-covered kitchen in keerhukara , a village in the state of kerala in southern india .
the stove has three stone blocks to place pots on while firewood is inserted in the space underneath .
ammukutty uses a thin blow pipe to fan the flames .
despite the presence of a chimney above the stove , a thick cloud of smoke starts to gather which makes her coughs .
heavy black soot covers the kitchen 's walls and pots and pans . it 's not just ammukutty who is exposed to the fumes – her six children also breathe in the toxins .
fifty-six percent of all indoor air pollution deaths occur among children under the age of 5 .
a huge health risk some 1.5 million people worldwide die each year from breathing in air filled with pollutants .
and the death toll from indoor air pollution in india is second only to that in china . in rural india , over 90 percent of people wood or cow dung on traditional stoves called ' chulas ' to cook their food , generating black carbon .
when the traditional stove is lit , a toxic blend of smoke and gases is released into homes .
health experts say exposure to the smoke can cause respiratory infection , pulmonary disease , asthma , lung cancer , pneumonia , heart disease and even blindness .
however , pollution from traditional cooking stoves is not just a problem in india : half the world 's population burns biomass fuels like wood , dung and crop waste when cooking .
the fumes are not only lethal but also contribute to climate change . according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , indoor air pollution is the third greatest health risk to indians after malnutrition and lack of safe sanitation and drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in rural india spend many hours carrying drinking water and collecting firewood until recently , ammukkutty had been cooking in discomfort for up to three hours every day .
" it was a messy affair with smoke everywhere and uncomfortable to be here and cook the daily requirements of my family but now it is very comfortable and i am quite happy . "
a few months ago , the family purchased a pollution-free stove for 24 euros .
it was a large sum for gopalakrishnan who runs a barber 's shop .
the only other appliances that the family owns are a small television and refrigerator .
less polluting cookers introduced developed by engineers at colorado state university – thousands of kilometres away from the humble village in kerala – the cooker 's main feature is a combustion chamber , which prevents hot air from escaping and reduces smoke .
the cooker 's manufacturers claim that it can reduce emissions by 80 percent , uses 60 percent less fuel and speeds up cooking time by 50 percent .
when ammukkutty lights the new stove , the difference is quite obvious : a thin layer of smoke still rises but visibility is much higher .
" it does not give off much smoke and the emission is very negligible .
the wood required is also very much less compared to the ‘ chulhas ' , ” she said .
“ the food is pretty tasty because there is no smoke getting into the food . " the family is now saving almost four euros each month on firewood – a significant portion of their income .
and , envirofit , a us-based not-for-profit organization that 's marketing the so-called pollution-free stoves , is keen to stress the accompanying health benefits .
g.d. adappa , general manager of the company 's india operations , travels around five states trying to convince people to buy the stove .
" you have seen the wall is completely dark and it is black .
now if you imagine a situation where the housewife cooks in that kind of atmosphere day in and day out , it means that she is exposing herself to the smoke and inhaling it , ” he said .
" this is the equivalent to smoking two and a half packs of cigarettes in a day , " he claimed .
but convincing people has n't been easy .
envirofit india is yet to make a profit and has relied on € 7.4 million of funding from the shell foundation , a charity established by the oil multinational shell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many people in poor communities , a new stove is not a priority modern stoves not a priority one problem is that many familes do n't see a new stove as a priority .
they already have a ' chulha ' and do not realize that it poses a health risk .
many families say they would rather spend the money on a new tv .
and often , it 's the men who make the decision about how money is spent , who are usually less often involved in cooking the family meals on smoky stoves .
most houses in this part of kerala are modest , one-bedroom dwellings , with mud floors and no running water .
the yards are often filled with piles of tree branches , which have been cut down for fire wood .
in another village nearby , vijayamma tries to cope with a chulha , and only occasionally using the gas stove .
the high price of cooking gas means she rarely uses it .
vijayamma admits using the chula can be unpleasant but she does n't believe it has affected her health .
" my family members , mainly my son says , ' why do n't you buy that stove ? ' but i say , ' do n't worry , let 's not spend that kind of money on a stove right now because i can manage with what there is .
we have no problems . "
she said that the decision to buy a pollution-free stove has got postponed .
but while vijayamma has delayed the purchase to save money , she continues to spend hours each day collecting firewood , like millions of women in rural india . using stoves that burns less wood and emits less smoke would not only be more environmentally friendly . if they could spend less time fetching firewood , poor women might help increase the family income by engaging in income-generating activies instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution from traditional cooking stoves are a problem across much of the developing world illiteracy and high prices are hurdles other alternative stoves like solar cookers and biomass gas stoves do exist across india .
however , a number of problems have been associated with them , including the need to cook outdoors , regular sunlight , poor design and maintenance and the expense or shortage of fuels .
despite efforts by the indian government and the private sector to push for the replacement of traditional stoves , they continue to we widely used . analysts vijay laxmi pandey , an associate professor at the indira gandhi institute of development research , believe that changing this reality wo n't be easy .
" i feel that in kerala and such states it should work , " she said , referring to pollution-free stoves .
" but uttar pradesh , bihar and rajasthan are less developed states , where the literacy rate is very low for females .
my study shows that health problems are very highly linked with education rates and literacy rates . "
pandey , who is an expert on indoor air pollution , also pointed out that the prices for the modern stoves are fairly high for poor farmers .
" however , people would be willing to buy new stoves if they see real benefits , if they really control the smoke and the level of fuel efficiency is high . " she said .

modern stoves can reduce emissions and health risks . ammukutty gopalakrishnan lights a traditional ' chulha ' in her soot-covered kitchen in keerhukara , a village in the state of kerala in southern india .
the stove has three stone blocks to place pots on while firewood is inserted in the space underneath .
ammukutty uses a thin blow pipe to fan the flames .
despite the presence of a chimney above the stove , a thick cloud of smoke starts to gather which makes her coughs .
heavy black soot covers the kitchen 's walls and pots and pans . it 's not just ammukutty who is exposed to the fumes – her six children also breathe in the toxins .
fifty-six percent of all indoor air pollution deaths occur among children under the age of 5 .
a huge health risk some 1.5 million people worldwide die each year from breathing in air filled with pollutants .
and the death toll from indoor air pollution in india is second only to that in china . in rural india , over 90 percent of people wood or cow dung on traditional stoves called ' chulas ' to cook their food , generating black carbon .
when the traditional stove is lit , a toxic blend of smoke and gases is released into homes .
health experts say exposure to the smoke can cause respiratory infection , pulmonary disease , asthma , lung cancer , pneumonia , heart disease and even blindness .
however , pollution from traditional cooking stoves is not just a problem in india : half the world 's population burns biomass fuels like wood , dung and crop waste when cooking .
the fumes are not only lethal but also contribute to climate change . according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , indoor air pollution is the third greatest health risk to indians after malnutrition and lack of safe sanitation and drinking water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in rural india spend many hours carrying drinking water and collecting firewood until recently , ammukkutty had been cooking in discomfort for up to three hours every day .
" it was a messy affair with smoke everywhere and uncomfortable to be here and cook the daily requirements of my family but now it is very comfortable and i am quite happy . "
a few months ago , the family purchased a pollution-free stove for 24 euros .
it was a large sum for gopalakrishnan who runs a barber 's shop .
the only other appliances that the family owns are a small television and refrigerator .
less polluting cookers introduced developed by engineers at colorado state university – thousands of kilometres away from the humble village in kerala – the cooker 's main feature is a combustion chamber , which prevents hot air from escaping and reduces smoke .
the cooker 's manufacturers claim that it can reduce emissions by 80 percent , uses 60 percent less fuel and speeds up cooking time by 50 percent .
when ammukkutty lights the new stove , the difference is quite obvious : a thin layer of smoke still rises but visibility is much higher .
" it does not give off much smoke and the emission is very negligible .
the wood required is also very much less compared to the ‘ chulhas ' , ” she said .
“ the food is pretty tasty because there is no smoke getting into the food . " the family is now saving almost four euros each month on firewood – a significant portion of their income .
and , envirofit , a us-based not-for-profit organization that 's marketing the so-called pollution-free stoves , is keen to stress the accompanying health benefits .
g.d. adappa , general manager of the company 's india operations , travels around five states trying to convince people to buy the stove .
" you have seen the wall is completely dark and it is black .
now if you imagine a situation where the housewife cooks in that kind of atmosphere day in and day out , it means that she is exposing herself to the smoke and inhaling it , ” he said .
" this is the equivalent to smoking two and a half packs of cigarettes in a day , " he claimed .
but convincing people has n't been easy .
envirofit india is yet to make a profit and has relied on € 7.4 million of funding from the shell foundation , a charity established by the oil multinational shell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many people in poor communities , a new stove is not a priority modern stoves not a priority one problem is that many familes do n't see a new stove as a priority .
they already have a ' chulha ' and do not realize that it poses a health risk .
many families say they would rather spend the money on a new tv .
and often , it 's the men who make the decision about how money is spent , who are usually less often involved in cooking the family meals on smoky stoves .
most houses in this part of kerala are modest , one-bedroom dwellings , with mud floors and no running water .
the yards are often filled with piles of tree branches , which have been cut down for fire wood .
in another village nearby , vijayamma tries to cope with a chulha , and only occasionally using the gas stove .
the high price of cooking gas means she rarely uses it .
vijayamma admits using the chula can be unpleasant but she does n't believe it has affected her health .
" my family members , mainly my son says , ' why do n't you buy that stove ? ' but i say , ' do n't worry , let 's not spend that kind of money on a stove right now because i can manage with what there is .
we have no problems . "
she said that the decision to buy a pollution-free stove has got postponed .
but while vijayamma has delayed the purchase to save money , she continues to spend hours each day collecting firewood , like millions of women in rural india . using stoves that burns less wood and emits less smoke would not only be more environmentally friendly . if they could spend less time fetching firewood , poor women might help increase the family income by engaging in income-generating activies instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pollution from traditional cooking stoves are a problem across much of the developing world illiteracy and high prices are hurdles other alternative stoves like solar cookers and biomass gas stoves do exist across india .
however , a number of problems have been associated with them , including the need to cook outdoors , regular sunlight , poor design and maintenance and the expense or shortage of fuels .
despite efforts by the indian government and the private sector to push for the replacement of traditional stoves , they continue to we widely used . analysts vijay laxmi pandey , an associate professor at the indira gandhi institute of development research , believe that changing this reality wo n't be easy .
" i feel that in kerala and such states it should work , " she said , referring to pollution-free stoves .
" but uttar pradesh , bihar and rajasthan are less developed states , where the literacy rate is very low for females .
my study shows that health problems are very highly linked with education rates and literacy rates . "
pandey , who is an expert on indoor air pollution , also pointed out that the prices for the modern stoves are fairly high for poor farmers .
" however , people would be willing to buy new stoves if they see real benefits , if they really control the smoke and the level of fuel efficiency is high . " she said .

as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.08.2010 st. pauli secure surprise bundesliga win , but only for fashion sense großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli are top of the table , at least in terms of style bundesliga soccer is still a fortnight away , but this season 's fashion champions have already been named .
and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.08.2010 german expellee groups reassert their history as charter turns 60 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the war germans were expelled from many countries critics have questioned the role of ethnic german expellee communities forced to leave their homes after world war ii .
as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

they have n't got time .
what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .
given such prospects , it 's hardly surprising that the german government is eager to breathe new life into its economic relations with not only brazil , but 32 other countries in central and south america , as well as the caribbean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle announced that latin america will now occupy a ' central place ' within government policy in berlin " the whole south american continent is taking off , " westerwelle said as he presented his ministry 's 60-page strategy paper on wednesday to an audience that included ambassadors from latin american nations .
" despite many setbacks and difficulties , it is a singular success story , and we should be smart enough to take part . "
three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?
because they wo n't , " he said .
" as they grow and become more successful , they will also demand to have a greater say when it comes to important topics in global politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american countries such as argentina are among the world 's leading exporters of soya beans this year , latin america is expecting economic growth of more than 5 percent .
europe , on the other hand , will be lucky if it registers just 1 percent .
in order to profit from latin america 's boom , germany has long been providing political assistance to economic partnerships between companies .
those partnerships are reflected in the trade volume between germany and latin america , which reached 36.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 48.2 billion -rrb- in 2009 , up 16.3 percent from 2005 .
now though , berlin has discovered that the region can also serve as a valuable partner when it comes to resolving global issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , disarmament , and the war on terror .
" we do n't just share common economic interests with latin america , we also share common values , " westerwelle said .
" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .
strategy welcomed by diplomats , ngos the new strategy was welcomed by many of the latin american diplomats who attended the presentation at the foreign ministry .
" we now have the opportunity to reestablish a historic bond , " said argentina 's ambassador , guillermo nielsen .
" at the start of the last century , our most important market for exports was germany , but in the postwar era , this relationship was lost .
now it 's coming back . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .
" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .
" i would like to know more about how the strategy paper defines sustainability - a term that is used quite frequently , " said hein broetz , latin american expert at misereor .
" indigenous people -lrb- in latin america -rrb- are often driven from their land to make way for large infrastructure and natural resource projects , and i was expecting the government to make a clearer statement as to where it stands . "

and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

at least 50 people have been killed in the blazes , which look set to continue . chancellor angela merkel offered to help russian efforts to put out hundreds of wildfires in a telephone conversation with president dmitry medvedev late on wednesday .
merkel expressed " solidarity and the german readiness to help in the face of the devastating fires , " according to a german government statement .
the russian head of state was said to have thanked merkel for her " display of solidarity , " going on to say the relevant russian authorities would assess whether german help could be useful .
the germans did not specify the exact nature of the aid offered to moscow by merkel .
italy has already come to the kremlin 's aid , putting two specialized firefighting planes at russia 's disposal .
at least 50 dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear how much of a helping hand merkel offered russia 's emergencies ministry says 162,000 emergency workers have been deployed to try to douse the flames , as hundreds of fires continue blazing around the country .
" in the last day , the situation in russia , in particular in the volga and central regions , has remained complicated , " said the head of the ministry 's crisis center , vladimir stepanov .
" in the course of the last 24 hours , 373 fires have appeared and 254 have been extinguished .
as a result there are now 589 wildfires burning in russia , covering an area of 196,000 hectares . "
the official death toll rose to at least 50 on thursday , after a corpse was discovered in a burned-down house and another victim died of his injuries in hospital .
the worst fires in russia 's modern history have been triggered by a protracted heat wave , which is showing no sign of easing ; temperatures are forecast to again hit 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- later on thursday , with hot weather expected to persist nationwide for at least five days .
military blaze bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires have led to high levels of smog in moscow president medvedev has issued official warnings to russia 's top two naval commanders and sacked a number of high-ranking officers , after they failed to prevent one of the fires spreading to a military base last week .
the staff headquarters , financial department , 13 warehouses containing aeronautical equipment and 17 storage areas containing vehicles were all destroyed by the blaze at the naval logistics base to the southeast of moscow .
russian officials have opened a criminal inquiry into the issue , investigating the possibility of " major damage through negligence . "
meanwhile , firefighters outside moscow are struggling to keep the blazes clear of the country 's top secret nuclear research facility in sarov , a city foreigners can not enter .
an unnamed official is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as saying " the situation is under control . "

but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .
it burns , it stings .
but so does the necessity of festooning myself before approaching the state for assistance .
looking somewhat like the perfect hindu patni .
i leave the house with my handbag tucked under my arm and muslim miya ’ s photo inside it . " seeking success in india ’ s financial hub we leave the park and walk back into town .
thousands of people come to mumbai every year to work and seek their fortune here .
some succeed , many do not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : altaf tyrewala likes recovering from the city in quiet and green parks tyrewala has been trying to buy an apartment in a relatively mixed and cosmopolitan area for months but without success so far . " it is not as if there aren ’ t places , " he explains .
" there are and maybe if i really stretch my budget to its breaking point i might even find one .
but there is also a sense of feeling that these places are not worth the price being asked .
this is related to the failing infrastructure of the city . " the government hasn ’ t done enough to ensure that if you have a flat for 150,000 dollars , you also have to have enough amenities to rationalize that kind of price .
so you end up paying for a space under the sky but your access routes will be in shambles , your neighborhood will flood in the monsoon , you may or may not have a water supply . " a sense of panic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands come to mumbai to seek their fortune every year he says he has often felt a sense of panic in the past few years .
two years ago , he even applied for a green card .
his wife , who is an american citizen , sponsored him .
he went back to the us to meet the requirements last year but he came home after only two months . " homesickness ? "
i ask .
" clearly i am doomed , " he sighs .
" i can not deny the lure of migration .
i belong to a stratum of society for whom it is much easier to go away . " yet , all said and done , this was a kind of a test for me and i wanted to see if i really wanted to migrate .
i find much to my dismay that i still don ’ t want to leave because , despite it all , here i sometimes get one second of profound peace that i don ’ t get anywhere else .

on the arabian sea , it is also india 's financial hub and thus a symbol of recent progress , however poverty is rife .
altaf tyrewala writes about the city 's many contrasts . with 20 million inhabitants , mumbai is known for its traffic jams , the loud honking of cars and buses and people everywhere .
altaf tyrewala lives in byculla , one of the city ’ s oldest areas , in the south .
the 33-year-old welcomes me to his city with a friendly smile . however , we do n't stay in byculla for long .
he takes me to the joseph baptista gardens , known locally as the mazagaon gardens .
he feels the quiet and green are rejuvenating when he has overdosed on the city . " mumbai is home , " he says .
" but it is also a place which has unwittingly turned out to be the backdrop for a lot of unsettling realizations and unexpected ways in which i have grown or regressed as a person . " the writer likens the city to a novel that has been written by a magical element - exciting but also complicated .
he says mumbai offers a plethora of interesting stories , many of which remain unknown . disillusioned with american way of life after leaving school , tyrewala went to new york to study business but he moved back to mumbai after graduating . " i saw a side of new york , which most foreign students don ’ t see .
i had three jobs at a time and often had to skip meals to pay my rent .
it stripped me of all illusions of the so-called american way of life , " he recalls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : byculla is one of the oldest neighborhoods in mumbai however , the young man who hails from a liberal family of khoja ismailis , who follow the aga khan , does not seem entirely at ease in his home country either .
he now lives with his mother , his wife and their one-year-old son in an apartment in byculla . anti-islamic prejudice despite multicultural nature of mumbai he says that although mumbai is considered the most multicultural city in india , there are still prejudices against islam and muslims .
in 1992 and 1993 , when some 900 people were killed in riots between hindus and muslims broke out most of the dead were muslims . " when i started writing my book , i had to put myself into other people ’ s shoes and step out of my cocoon .
i realized that life really is very harsh for people who are not cushioned from the realities out there .
that ’ s when i became more sensitive to minor nuances in the workplace , in friends , in people i came across .
that 's also when i started picking up these minor clues about how my islamic background actually plays a much bigger role in their imagination than it does in my imagination . " in " no god in sight " , tyrewala plays with this dichotomy .
one of the protagonists is avantika , a hindu who has married a muslim against the wishes of her family .
when one day her husband does not come home , she decides to go to the authorities to seek help . " only one thing left : i bring down the packet of tandoori masala from the kitchen shelf , " the author reads from his novel .
" i take a pinch of the angry-red powder and streak it down my middle parting .

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .
but is that good enough for iphone and ipod users ?
" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.08.2010 historians identify rare piano once played by mozart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the piano was being advertised for far less than it was worth the asking price of a piano has increased more than a hundredfold following a discovery by music historian andreas beuermann .
he believes the piano is a rare model once played by wolfgang amadeus mozart . experts now believe a fortepiano in southern germany may be a long-sought model played by wolfgang amadeus mozart during the composer 's stays in strasbourg .
the instrument currently belongs to piano maker martin becker , who purchased the piano around 25 years ago from an antique dealer in strasbourg .
he recently offered the instrument for sale .
" somehow i came upon the idea of auctioning it on ebay and had a price in mind of around 30,000 to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,500 to $ 53,000 -rrb- , " becker told german radio broadcaster swr .
instead , the piano may be worth more than a hundred times its original asking price , and becker has adjusted its listing online to five million euros .
the fortepiano - an early version of the modern piano - was built in 1775 and is likely one of just eight models known to be have been made by a piano maker from zweibruecken named christian baumann .
experts are currently examining the piano 's history .
with help from a painting the night after auctioning the piano and failing to get bids at his original price , becker said he was contacted by music historian andreas beuermann , who told becker that mozart may have once performed using the instrument .
beuermann recognized the piano from an historical oil painting hanging in vienna , in which joseph haydn is shown playing what may be the exact same instrument .
music historians have long searched for the eighth piano built by baumann , which mozart mentioned in letters to his father .
the fortepiano , developed around the turn of the 18th century , differs from the modern piano in that it has a much lighter frame and smaller dynamic range .
mozart , haydn and beethoven all composed for the fortepiano , which was designed for smaller settings rather than large concert halls .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 05.08.2010 renewable energy technology developing faster than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a world leader in developing solar power technology the fraunhofer institute for energy technology has reported a marked progress in the capacity of renewable energy in germany .
but this could mean the country is running into a supply conflict with nuclear power . over-heated trains , dying fish , and devastating forest fires .
so far , the extreme summer heat has brought practically nothing but bad news - and with it comes the fact that the planet is getting measurably hotter by the year , with unknown consequences .
but the fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy systems technology released a report on thursday that offers a little sun-related succor .
the institute has recorded better-than-expected progress in harnessing the power of the sun on these hot summer days .
much earlier than expected , solar , wind and water power are expected to cover germany 's total energy demands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is likely to stick with nuclear power for a while rainer baake of the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- german environment aid -rrb- , which commissioned the new report , expressed his delight .
" nobody expected the development of renewable energy to be as quick as we 're experiencing in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" our government now estimates that in the year 2020 we will already have 40 percent feed-in from renewable sources .
that is phenomenal . "
carsten pape of the fraunhofer institute says this could have a real effect on germany 's carbon dioxide emissions targets .
" theoretically , because things have developed much faster than expected one could raise the targets and say , ' more is possible . '
the co2 emissions through energy production could be reduced by around 40 percent , " he said .
the conflict of supply but there is one problem .
the current german government has decided to reverse an earlier decision to phase out nuclear power by 2020 .
instead , angela merkel 's center-right coalition has opted to extend the operational lifespan of nuclear power stations .
this puts the grid in a paradoxical situation .
since germany has introduced a law designed to give renewable energy precedence on the grid , and since there will be times in the next few years - the sunniest , windiest times - when renewable sources will be able to cover 100 percent of germany 's energy needs , nuclear power stations will be surplus to requirements .
but they ca n't be , because nuclear power stations ca n't be switched off at short notice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government is developing a new energy concept " that means that we need flexible power generators that can always produce electricity when wind does n't blow and sun does n't shine , " explains baake .
" it is simply not possible to shut off nuclear power generators from nine o 'clock in the morning to four o 'clock in the afternoon , for example .
and that means we 're going to have a big conflict in our electricity system if our government decides in favor of life-time extension for nuclear power stations . "
cooperation because the lion 's share of renewable energy in germany comes from wind and solar power , the technological challenge for renewable energy remains storage .
but europe-wide cooperation can also help .
different countries specialise in different renewable technologies .
" future technologies like off-shore wind are very strong in britain , and i think this is good because we can learn from each other , " said baake .
" but we should never forget about the goal - and the goal is 100 percent renewable energy , at the latest by 2050 . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and if newly promoted st. pauli fare half as well on the pitch as on the catwalk , they 'll surely be delighted . if clothes make the man , they 're still probably not enough to guarantee success on the soccer pitch , at least not judging by the results of this year 's bundesliga fashion league table .
the league 's giants were largely banished into obscurity while the little teams shone as a panel of judges ranked the jerseys of this year 's eighteen championship hopefuls .
bundesliga newcomers , and probable drop-zone candidates st. pauli topped the style rankings for their earthy brown shirts with jet black shorts and socks , an accolade which could prove to be the high point of their season .
" st. pauli do n't just flatter with their cuddly choice of material , " juror and fashion design professor julia schnitzer said of the silky-looking outfit .
" in this jersey you just look good , anywhere , and you can transform that general sense of belonging into a really special feeling . "
the almost all-red shirts and black shorts combination of freiburg was dubbed " the most elegant " of the 2010 bundesliga - netting second spot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich got flamed for a lack of effort , but red and white scored well overall " in freiburg they have realized that the modern pro does n't just have to be able to play football , he 's also a celebrity and sex symbol at the same time , " the jury surmised .
the winning combo : red and white and it seems that if you want soccer style , then hamburg really is the place to be - contrary to many pundits ' past assertions on sporting elegance .
the city 's largest club , perennial bundesliga front-runners hamburg sv came in third , just two spots behind their reeperbahn-based neighbors , st. pauli .
hamburg 's white shirt and red shorts mixture - which has remained unchanged for years to those without an eye for fashion - was described by the panel as " the modern classic " , where " nostalgia meets with visions of the future . "
the distinctive red with flashes of white traditional to fc cologne won the team fourth place , with the judges drawn to the aggressive , simplistic tone .
apparently the outfit " screams attack , " which is exactly what many of the cologne faithful were shouting for last season .
the red and white color combo is one of football 's most popular in general , and it dominated the european qualification spots in this table , with the " zesty , funny , modern , and different " maroon and white of hanover fifth in the fashion standings .
substance over style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's " snappy , very snappy " design shake-up earned them sixth with the possible exception of hamburg , none of the teams which are likely to be front-runners on the pitch next season had much to cheer about on the style front .
defending champions bayern munich , for instance , could only manage thirteenth for this year 's outfit , even though it will still fly off the shop shelves .
" they 're so good that it simply does n't matter what they 're wearing !
it seems the jersey designers at bayern munich have worked to this motto for a long , long time . "
werder bremen came in sixth , stuttgart seventh , dortmund eighth , wolfsburg ninth , and schalke 12th : and all these sides will expect to perform markedly better that that on the pitch this season .
another title challenger , bayer leverkusen , even earned a place in the fashion relegation zone , after experimenting with one of the biggest design changes of the season .
the traditional vertical red and black stripes have been replaced with an all-black affair , with one prominent diagonal red stripe down the chest .
" it 's a shirt that looks like a german no-entry traffic sign , " the judges conclude .
" it makes each player look like he 's been crossed off the list . "
design drop-zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : behold !
the bundesliga 's biggest crime against fashion , that 's if you can bear to look however , almost as if the jury wanted to at least appear to have taken the football form book into account , they did pick a couple of teams with poor prospects this season to occupy the bottom two spots in their table .
mainz 's red-on-top , white-below affair was decried as " a red bag with sleeves attached , perhaps good for enabling exclusive concentration on the game . "
and in the admittedly unlikely event that you 're thinking of buying a bundesliga soccer shirt purely as a fashion statement , then steer well clear of the all-white of borussia moenchengladbach - adorned only with the almost fluorescent yellow of its main sponsor 's logo . it looks like a blank sheet of paper which has been marked with a highlighter pen .
" no cut , no innovative material , a complete absence of any form of design .
nowadays , good design does n't have to cost money , it 's a pity that information has n't filtered through to moenchengladbach yet . "
but perhaps the gladbach board should n't despair .
armed with the knowledge that bayern munich ca n't be bothered to put in the effort , and that frankfurt 's 15th-placed kit " is not only phenomenally unsexy , but almost entirely unflattering as well , " football clubs should remember that most football fans are likely to go out and buy the same shirt as always this year - the one peddled by the team they support .

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .

the bank allegedly encouraged investors to bet against the same mortgages it was financing . deutsche bank has found itself under scrutiny by the us securities exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , just one month after goldman sachs settled fraud allegations for $ 550 million -lrb- 417 million euros -rrb- , and one week after citigroup agreed to pay a $ 75 million settlement .
the wall street journal reported tuesday that deutsche bank is one of several financial institutions being examined by the sec amid allegations it encouraged investment in the housing market while betting on its imminent collapse .
a deutsche bank trader created an index in 2006 to make betting against subprime home loans easier , and actively encouraged clients to do so .
at the same time , the bank was financing subprime lenders on the brink of collapse , such as the now-defunct novastar financial .

however , it told the wall street journal that it " maintained a net long position in the housing market and ultimately suffered billions in losses , even after factoring in our hedges and offsetting positions . "
federal money was later used bail out the american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- , which had insured volatile deutsche bank mortgage securities .
deutsche bank recently agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to the financial industry regulatory authority , but neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .
it is also fighting a fraud-and-misrepresentation lawsuit against m & t bank in a new york state court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.08.2010 german expellee groups reassert their history as charter turns 60 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the war germans were expelled from many countries critics have questioned the role of ethnic german expellee communities forced to leave their homes after world war ii .
as the charter of german expellees turns 60 , the groups have reasserted their presence . bundestag president norbert lammert spoke out thursday against the proposal for an official national day of remembrance for german world war ii expellees , saying such a day would ultimately not contribute to public awareness on the subject . speaking on german public radio on the 60th anniversary of the signing of the charter of german expellees , lammert said the german calendar was already full of routine yearly commemorations .
he argued that the celebration of significant anniversaries would bring more attention to the cause of ethnic germans expelled from their homelands in eastern europe after the war . the president of the league of expellees , christian democrat parliamentarian erika steinbach , recently called on the german government to make august 5 an official national day of remembrance .
she cited the suffering ethnic germans underwent while being torn from the lands where they had lived , in some cases for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials marked the anniversary in stuttgart chairman of the bundestag parliament 's home affairs committee , wolfgang bosbach , showed his support for such a day of remembrance .
he said in an interview with the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger that he considered " the demand understandable to keep the memory of flight and expulsion alive - especially as the affected generation is getting smaller every year . " he added that more awareness was needed , as the injustices of flight and expulsion exist even today . ' will for reconciliation ' ceremonies were held thursday in stuttgart to mark the anniversary of the charter , the document created by some of the millions of ethnic german expellees .
in the charter , they pledged to forego revenge and retaliation for their expulsion . lammert and steinbach were both in attendance , along with several other political notables , including foreign minister guido westerwelle and interior minister thomas de maiziere . at a wreath-laying ceremony in stuttgart , where the charter was signed in 1950 , steinbach called the charter an important document with a message of peaceful coexistence in europe . steinbach said rather than speaking of hatred toward neighboring nations , the declaration spoke of the " will for reconciliation . "
lammert said the charter " one of the founding documents of the federal republic , " calling it an " essential " contribution to the german success story and subsequent economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach -lrb- left -rrb- wants august 5 to be a national day of remembrance controversial interpretation generations after the signing of the charter , however , expellees are still pushing for their past plight to be recognized .
advocates for greater recognition of expellees are often accused of historical revisionism , of trying to gloss over the tragedies of world war ii and of trying to position german expellees as the victims of the nazi defeat .
the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

the debate flared recently with the appointment of arnold toelg and hartmut saenger to the board of trustees responsible for a recently approved , government-backed berlin museum documenting the story of german expellees .
both men are members of the league of expellees and have been accused of rewriting history .
among other things , the pair have made comments in recent years alluding to the suffering of germans at the hands of allied powers during the war .
the remarks have also suggested the men supported a slight shifting of blame for the war away from nazi germany .
steinbach defended the two , telling the daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau recently that their comments would " not be questioned by any serious historian . "
divisive groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany set up refugee camps to accomodate expellees ines michalowski , an analyst with the social science research center in berlin , says expellee organizations remain divisive to this day .
" i think these organizations actually create a lot of dissonance and disagreement within the german population and among those who do have a certain understanding for their issues and for what they want , " she told deutsche welle .
" namely a recognition of the fact that they have been expelled , and recognition of their story of suffering and of the loss of their homes . " michalowski says their motives are often misunderstood by the german public and others , who see " a revisionist approach to history and a group of people who can not really accept that germany lost the war and that these territories went back to poland or to the czech republic . "
distant stories the expellees and their descendents are organized into 21 regional associations that correspond to the areas of origin of their members .
there are 16 further organizations to correspond to expellees ' current residence , as well as five associate member organizations . a broader organization , the league of expellees , seeks to lend a louder voice to the concerns of expellees at the federal level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the living expellees were children when they fled jochen oltmer , a social scientist with the institute for migration research and intercultural studies in osnabrueck , says the calls for more rights for descendents of expellees are becoming less relevant as time goes by .
" today , when we discuss refugees and expelled germans , we now refer to second and third generation individuals , " he said .
" there are no longer many refugees and expellees who witnessed these events as an adult . "
oltmer says this means that expellees ' descendents have been fully integrated into mainstream german society .
" i think it 's possible to say that , without doubt , this integration of german refugees and expellees , which seemed impossible in the 1940s , actually has had a successful history , " he said .
" these organizations now really only espouse regional interests .
the groups are local or regional and are interested mainly in the history and culture of the areas from which those people came .
in this day and age , only a handful of more centralized bodies have any real political demands , " oltmer added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 05.08.2010 fight against blood diamonds ca n't be forgotten , campaigner says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners pan for diamonds in northeastern sierra leone blood diamonds continue to fuel conflicts around the world , but it 's taken a splash of celebrity for the global community to take note , says global witness campaigner elly harrowell . the war crimes trial of former liberian president charles taylor in the hague is expected to take a glamorous turn with british supermodel naomi campbell scheduled to testify thursday .
she 's claimed that taylor gave her a large , rough diamond at a dinner party in south africa in 1997 .
that diamond is allegedly linked to the civil war in sierra leone .
taylor stands accused of arming rebels in return for illegally mined diamonds . elly harrowell is a campaigner at the london-based organization global witness , which investigates and publicizes links between the exploitation of natural resources and conflict and corruption .
she spoke to deutsche welle about why blood diamonds are still a pressing issue and why it has taken a celebrity for the world to pay attention . deutsche welle : has naomi campbell 's scheduled appearance in charles taylor 's trial next week helped refocus global attention on conflict or blood diamonds ? elly harrowell : yes absolutely , i think it 's a little sad in a way that we need the input of a celebrity such as naomi campbell in order to focus people 's minds on the issue of conflict diamonds .
but what it has done that is quite positive is get people talking about an issue that many people seem to think has fallen away in recent years .
the question of conflict diamonds is still very much a live question , one that continues to rear its ugly head in a number of places .
so i 'm certainly glad that this is back on the front pages , so that we can keep pushing to find a resolution to the problem . campaigners like your group have been trying over the years to keep this issue alive , why do you think it keeps slipping off the radar ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell -lrb- right -rrb- is set to testify at the trial of former liberian president charles taylor i think there have been a few relatively quiet years in terms of conflict diamonds .
after the horrific wars that we saw in west africa , in angola as well , that brought conflict diamonds to the fore .
after they had ended , there were n't quite so many real classic conflict diamond wars in the news anymore , that is until the issue of zimbabwe came to the forefront in the last couple of years where we 've seen , unfortunately once again , quite horrific violence associated with the diamond trade . there 's also the question of the cote d 'ivoire .
cote d 'ivoire remains the only country in the world whose diamonds are under un sanctions at the moment .
that 's because they had a long rebel war where the north and south of the country were split , and in effect all of the diamond-producing areas are found in the north of the country , and under the control of the groups .
elsewhere , there are still concerns , and we hear periodic reports of human rights abuses in the diamond trade in , for example , angola , and we also have countries such as venezuela where the implementation of the kimberley process is very weak and problematic and we see real rampant diamond smuggling . the kimberley process is a system that participating countries have signed up to trace the diamond from the mine to the polishing stage .
this has to do with rough diamonds of course .
where are we at currently in this process ? the kimberley process has been enforced since 2003 , so it 's had seven years now to prove its worth .
i think it 's fair to say that it 's had a few achievements .
the existence of the kimberley process is in itself an achievement .
it was quite pioneering in the way that it brought together governments , industry and civil society to work together to address the issue of conflict diamonds , and in some of the countries where we saw real conflict diamond problems , the kimberley process has helped to push up official diamond revenue , which takes the revenue out of the hands of armed groups and into the state coffers and pushes development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kimberley process regulators recently allowed zimbabwe to resume some diamond exports so it does have a lot of potential to do good and to prevent conflict diamond issues , however it 's not really achieving that full potential at the moment .
we 've talked about some of the problem cases that still exist - in venezuela , cote d 'ivoire , zimbabwe - and there 's also a real need for the kimberley process to be reformed , in order that it can really effectively face some of the challenges it faces today . global witness has been calling for increased supervision of the industry by governments in participating countries .
is that part of the reforms you were referring to ? it is , there 's a number of reforms we think are really quite crucial .
for example , we think the kimberley process should reiterate and strengthen its commitment to protecting human rights .
we feel that 's really at the heart of the kimberley process , the reason we set it up in the first place was to protect from harm those communities involved in diamond mining .
we also think that governments and industry should agree to set up some sort of secretariat for the kp .
you might be quite surprised to know that we 're talking about a system that brings together 75 countries and yet it does n't have a permanent secretariat yet .
it does n't have one dollar of funding .
and there are other issues that we feel really need to be reformed , such as improving the decision-making process , set a defining standard , improving the practices on peer review and so on at the heart of the kp - all of these reforms will need governments to stand up and be counted in order to be implemented . blood diamonds or conflict diamonds - the term generally refers to diamonds that are used to fuel conflicts , even fund conflicts - and sounds quite dramatic .
give us some sense of exactly the nature of oppression or violence that 's unleashed on people who are caught up in these sorts of situations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands in sierra leone suffered amputations during the country 's civil war well you 've taken a very interesting question here actually , because the definition of conflict diamonds themselves can be quite problematic .
the classical definition that the kimberley process uses is diamonds that are used by rebel groups to fuel armed conflicts against legitimate governments .
that 's the kind of thing we saw for example in sierra leone , where rebel groups were forcing local communities to mine for diamonds in order to buy more arms .
we saw terrible abuse against local people : murders , amputations and so on .
the issues we 're seeing today , for example in zimbabwe , are slightly different because here we 're talking not about rebel groups forcing people to mine and abusing people but actually government groups , the armed forces , even police , who are committing many of the same acts : forced labor , rape , murder , beatings of local people , but this time not by a rebel group but by a recognized government force . which leads us back to the charles taylor trial .
some experts have said that the scope of this trial goes far beyond the taylor case itself and the appearance or not of a star like naomi campbell , but it takes us to the issue of heads of state abusing their citizens , and that these leaders could later find themselves in the dock over the issue . yes , absolutely .
i think that the charles taylor trial is quite trailblazing in this way , it will send a message - a very strong message - to leaders of countries that , actually , this kind of behavior will not be tolerated by the international community .
that we will come after them , as it were , to hold them accountable for any abuse committed against their citizens .
and i think that 's a very positive and strong message to be sending out at this time . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam -lrb- skt -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.08.2010 german economy bounces back , boosting optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are feeling good about the economy these days the german economy is riding high , with a wave of positive indicators and good quarterly results boosting overall optimism .
but there are concerns that the second part of the year could put a damper on the party . the economy in germany appears to have left the financial crisis behind it , if the host of good news and positive numbers is to be believed .
the recent flood of good economic tidings might even be described as an embarrassment of riches , especially given the dark mood over the past several years .
in july , the closely watch ifo business climate index rose far above expectations .
the " increase is the biggest jump since the reunification of germany , " said ifo president hans-werner sinn , noting that confidence among the 7,000 german companies surveyed had reached a three-year peak .
" the german economy is having a party again . "
the european central bank reported an increased pace of credit growth to the private sector .
it edged up to its highest rate in nearly a year .
loans to the private sector rose 0.3 percent compared with june 2009 , up from 0.2 percent annual growth in may , the ecb said .
the rate is still weak , but points in a positive direction .
more good news deutsche bank increased its pre-tax earnings to 1.5 billion euros and software giant sap reported a second-quarter profit increase of 15 percent .
automaker daimler turned last year 's second-quarter loss into profits of 1.3 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup raised german spirits , which helps the economy the celebratory mood felt by industry and analysts is rubbing off on consumers as well .
despite the austerity program announced by the german government and higher health insurance premiums , german consumer confidence is up strongly .
it has been helped by everything from expectations that economic recovery will keep unemployment down to the football world cup and sunny weather , according to a survey by germany 's gfk market research institute .
the institute said its forward-looking overall indicator for august rose to 3.9 points from 3.6 points in july , the highest level since november 2009 .
government economists said it is possible that the jobless rate will sink under the three-million mark in the fall .
second-half blues ?
however , there are voices that warn against too much optimism .
they say while things are rolling along well now , the second half of this year could see a slowdown .
the iwh institute in halle says it is keeping its champagne corked , since it predicts the recovery will slow by the end of this year .
berlin 's diw economics institute also predicts a " slower dynamic " for the final six months of 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry slowing chinese growth could hurt german export numbers the fault lies with the weak economy in the us and a slowdown of growth in china , which could hit german exports .
the rigorous austerity programs that nearly all eurozone countries have embarked on could also kill the party buzz .
but according to michel heise , chief economist at the allianz group , there is still reason for optimism despite the consolidation programs .
he does not think they are hard or far-reaching enough to slam the brakes on a recovery .
" that 's due in large part of the depreciation of the euro , which has brought about an economic boost , " he said .
" it could increase exports from eurozone countries by up to four percent , which is naturally good for the economy . "
under capacity others are more cautious with their rosy outlooks , including sinn of the munich-based ifo institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's fall in value made german exports more attractive despite the excellent figures in the business climate index , he worries about exports falling due to weakening economies in some other countries ; the government 's money-saving program , which could dampen consumer demand ; as well as anemic growth in investments .
his institute predicts investment levels will rise only one percent this year .
the reason for that is that many firms are not yet operating at capacity and are therefore less likely to need , for example , new machinery .
" the mood is better than actual conditions are right now , " said michael groemling from berlin 's diw .
" still , optimism is strong in germany , especially in industrial companies .
that 's very good news at the end of the day . " author : rolf wenkel -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" medvedev signed the bill to expand the fsb 's powers last week after it passed unhindered through the lower and upper houses of russia 's parliament , the duma , with 354 votes in favor , mostly from the president 's ruling united russia party .
the new law will provide the fsb , the successor to the soviet union 's kgb security service , with the power to detain citizens it suspects of wrongdoing even if it has no evidence against them .
the security services will be able to issue individuals of whom they are suspicious with official warnings , inviting them to what the law calls " precautionary talks " with the fsb to prevent the possibility of the citizen committing a criminal act " against the country 's security " in the future .
refusing or failing to attend these " precautionary talks " could lead to a fine of around $ 1,500 -lrb- 1,140 euros -rrb- or detention for as long as 15 days .
despite being sold as the next step in russia 's fight against terror , critics say that the legislation could be used to target and silence political dissidents and outspoken journalists as well as violent extremists .
" the legislation provides new , preemptive powers for the fsb , which is always controversial , " jana kobzova , a russia expert at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" some other states may have similar legislation but what is the cause of concern is that this legislation was adopted in russia where division of powers does n't really work , where the courts and judicial system enjoy little public trust and corruption among the state officials is rampant .
russia has problems with rule of law and the new legislation doesn ’ t improve its record . " " whatever the motif behind the legislation was , it is disturbing that such laws were adopted at the time when the kremlin ’ s preparing for the 2012 elections , " she added . " the legislation provides opportunity to use the fsb to achieve political ends - this does n't mean this will happen but the laws may lead to an atmosphere of fear among the civil society which may lead to self-censorship .
my belief is that the main aim of the legislation is not to crackdown on the media or civil society , but to preempt , to create a situation when crackdown is no longer needed . " opponents fear a return to soviet-era security powers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kgb was all-powerful in soviet-era security affairs critics claim the law will consolidate the already powerful fsb 's hold over security issues and push russia further toward an authoritarian police state .
it is feared that it would represent a return to a structure similar to the soviet union 's where the absolute power of the secret services and the control of peaceful citizens kept an iron grip on personal rights . but not all russia observers are convinced that the kremlin is attempting to usher in a kgb-style reinvention of the security structure and use the new law to suppress the opposition . " i do n't think that this is a retreat to stalinism as some claim , " alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" this law is mainly directed toward fighting terrorism in north caucasus , where the security services prove to be completely helpless .
in the end , the law will not work like so many others in russia . " " there is a big difference between the soviet era and today 's russia , " kobzova said .
" the soviet state spread the atmosphere of fear to prevent emergence of politics and people 's participation in it .
today , the key for the state authorities is to make sure people are not interested in politics .
a person who does n't care about politics or the situation with human rights in russia may live a comfortable life without ever encountering an fsb officer . what suffers the most is democracy in russia : the kremlin is interested in stability , not democracy . " in its former kgb incarnation , the russian security services often interned political dissidents without trial , a scenario which critics within russia say could be repeated under the new law should targeted individuals refuse the much-feared fsb 's invitation . the new law is the latest in a long line of slowly implemented changes to the security apparatus which have been increasing the fsb 's control since the turn of the millennium . the fsb 's powers grew throughout former kgb agent vladimir putin 's eight-year presidency but it was hoped that medvedev , a lawyer by trade without any affiliation with the security services , would dilute the fsb 's influence over russian society when he came to power in 2008 . medvedev follows putin 's cue and empowers the fsb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is continuing putin 's work of empowering the fsb instead , critics say that medvedev has reneged on his pledge to liberalize russia and has promoted only cosmetic reforms while working to strengthen the powers of the state .
medvedev 's new legislation , they say , could lead to the fsb being elevated above the law and could be used to silence the opposition . the russian president has defended the law , calling it a necessary improvement on existing legislation .
" every country has a right to fine-tune its legislation , including in respect to special services , " he said recently .
he also took full credit for the bill , saying it had been drawn up on his personal orders .
" i would like you to know that what is happening today has been done on my direct instructions . " jana kobzova believes that this statement shows that medvedev is confident in his level of popularity and the inability of the opposition to mobilise any support capable of challenging his leadership .
the president already has enough control to maintain the status quo - and now has a law which could stabilize it should it be challenged . " both putin and medvedev enjoy considerable public support and top all opinion polls , " kobzova said . " what is more important is that a decrease in the popular support for the duo does not increase the numbers for the opposition , so there is no real political alternative to the current leadership - and the leadership knows it .

they have n't got time .
what with burgeoning foreign investment and preparations for the 2014 soccer world cup and the 2016 olympics , there 's too much to look forward to .
given such prospects , it 's hardly surprising that the german government is eager to breathe new life into its economic relations with not only brazil , but 32 other countries in central and south america , as well as the caribbean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle announced that latin america will now occupy a ' central place ' within government policy in berlin " the whole south american continent is taking off , " westerwelle said as he presented his ministry 's 60-page strategy paper on wednesday to an audience that included ambassadors from latin american nations .
" despite many setbacks and difficulties , it is a singular success story , and we should be smart enough to take part . "
three-pronged approach germany last formalized a strategy for latin america back in 1995 ; now , the region deserves more focused attention , the foreign minister said .
the new strategy entails a three-pronged approach to boost trade , harness the diplomatic influence of key players such as brazil , and take on more collective responsibility for international issues .
there should be a " new quality " to the relationship between germany and latin america , said westerwelle - a relationship between equals .
" do we really believe that growing , dynamic regions like latin america will be content to be viewed by us solely as trade partners or investment locations ?
because they wo n't , " he said .
" as they grow and become more successful , they will also demand to have a greater say when it comes to important topics in global politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin american countries such as argentina are among the world 's leading exporters of soya beans this year , latin america is expecting economic growth of more than 5 percent .
europe , on the other hand , will be lucky if it registers just 1 percent .
in order to profit from latin america 's boom , germany has long been providing political assistance to economic partnerships between companies .
those partnerships are reflected in the trade volume between germany and latin america , which reached 36.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 48.2 billion -rrb- in 2009 , up 16.3 percent from 2005 .
now though , berlin has discovered that the region can also serve as a valuable partner when it comes to resolving global issues such as the financial crisis , climate change , disarmament , and the war on terror .
" we do n't just share common economic interests with latin america , we also share common values , " westerwelle said .
" even given the differences that exist between latin america 's individual states , this is the best basis for our close cooperation . "
according to the new strategy , germany will now also be offering assistance on issues concerning human rights and democratic rule .
in the case of the somewhat more complicated relationship with cuba , however , germany will continue to defer to common european policy .
strategy welcomed by diplomats , ngos the new strategy was welcomed by many of the latin american diplomats who attended the presentation at the foreign ministry .
" we now have the opportunity to reestablish a historic bond , " said argentina 's ambassador , guillermo nielsen .
" at the start of the last century , our most important market for exports was germany , but in the postwar era , this relationship was lost .
now it 's coming back . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian coal exports are booming , but other latin american countries such as mexico hope to make inroads in renewable energies mexican ambassador miguel angel padilla said he was looking forward to a relationship with germany that would extend beyond the two countries ' already close economic cooperation in the automotive , chemical , and electric technology sectors .
" i hope to see more cooperation , economic exchange , and direct investment in renewable energies between germany and mexico in the near future , " said padilla .
representatives of several non-governmental organizations as well as the catholic aid agency misereor particularly praised the strategy 's statement of support for those working to protect human rights in latin america .
however , they cautioned that a close eye must be kept on further economic cooperation that could result in increased poverty and displacement for people living on land that is of value because of its crops or natural resources .
" i would like to know more about how the strategy paper defines sustainability - a term that is used quite frequently , " said hein broetz , latin american expert at misereor .
" indigenous people -lrb- in latin america -rrb- are often driven from their land to make way for large infrastructure and natural resource projects , and i was expecting the government to make a clearer statement as to where it stands . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 05.08.2010 fight against blood diamonds ca n't be forgotten , campaigner says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners pan for diamonds in northeastern sierra leone blood diamonds continue to fuel conflicts around the world , but it 's taken a splash of celebrity for the global community to take note , says global witness campaigner elly harrowell . the war crimes trial of former liberian president charles taylor in the hague is expected to take a glamorous turn with british supermodel naomi campbell scheduled to testify thursday .
she 's claimed that taylor gave her a large , rough diamond at a dinner party in south africa in 1997 .
that diamond is allegedly linked to the civil war in sierra leone .
taylor stands accused of arming rebels in return for illegally mined diamonds . elly harrowell is a campaigner at the london-based organization global witness , which investigates and publicizes links between the exploitation of natural resources and conflict and corruption .
she spoke to deutsche welle about why blood diamonds are still a pressing issue and why it has taken a celebrity for the world to pay attention . deutsche welle : has naomi campbell 's scheduled appearance in charles taylor 's trial next week helped refocus global attention on conflict or blood diamonds ? elly harrowell : yes absolutely , i think it 's a little sad in a way that we need the input of a celebrity such as naomi campbell in order to focus people 's minds on the issue of conflict diamonds .
but what it has done that is quite positive is get people talking about an issue that many people seem to think has fallen away in recent years .
the question of conflict diamonds is still very much a live question , one that continues to rear its ugly head in a number of places .
so i 'm certainly glad that this is back on the front pages , so that we can keep pushing to find a resolution to the problem . campaigners like your group have been trying over the years to keep this issue alive , why do you think it keeps slipping off the radar ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell -lrb- right -rrb- is set to testify at the trial of former liberian president charles taylor i think there have been a few relatively quiet years in terms of conflict diamonds .
after the horrific wars that we saw in west africa , in angola as well , that brought conflict diamonds to the fore .
after they had ended , there were n't quite so many real classic conflict diamond wars in the news anymore , that is until the issue of zimbabwe came to the forefront in the last couple of years where we 've seen , unfortunately once again , quite horrific violence associated with the diamond trade . there 's also the question of the cote d 'ivoire .
cote d 'ivoire remains the only country in the world whose diamonds are under un sanctions at the moment .
that 's because they had a long rebel war where the north and south of the country were split , and in effect all of the diamond-producing areas are found in the north of the country , and under the control of the groups .
elsewhere , there are still concerns , and we hear periodic reports of human rights abuses in the diamond trade in , for example , angola , and we also have countries such as venezuela where the implementation of the kimberley process is very weak and problematic and we see real rampant diamond smuggling . the kimberley process is a system that participating countries have signed up to trace the diamond from the mine to the polishing stage .
this has to do with rough diamonds of course .
where are we at currently in this process ? the kimberley process has been enforced since 2003 , so it 's had seven years now to prove its worth .
i think it 's fair to say that it 's had a few achievements .
the existence of the kimberley process is in itself an achievement .
it was quite pioneering in the way that it brought together governments , industry and civil society to work together to address the issue of conflict diamonds , and in some of the countries where we saw real conflict diamond problems , the kimberley process has helped to push up official diamond revenue , which takes the revenue out of the hands of armed groups and into the state coffers and pushes development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kimberley process regulators recently allowed zimbabwe to resume some diamond exports so it does have a lot of potential to do good and to prevent conflict diamond issues , however it 's not really achieving that full potential at the moment .
we 've talked about some of the problem cases that still exist - in venezuela , cote d 'ivoire , zimbabwe - and there 's also a real need for the kimberley process to be reformed , in order that it can really effectively face some of the challenges it faces today . global witness has been calling for increased supervision of the industry by governments in participating countries .
is that part of the reforms you were referring to ? it is , there 's a number of reforms we think are really quite crucial .
for example , we think the kimberley process should reiterate and strengthen its commitment to protecting human rights .
we feel that 's really at the heart of the kimberley process , the reason we set it up in the first place was to protect from harm those communities involved in diamond mining .
we also think that governments and industry should agree to set up some sort of secretariat for the kp .
you might be quite surprised to know that we 're talking about a system that brings together 75 countries and yet it does n't have a permanent secretariat yet .
it does n't have one dollar of funding .
and there are other issues that we feel really need to be reformed , such as improving the decision-making process , set a defining standard , improving the practices on peer review and so on at the heart of the kp - all of these reforms will need governments to stand up and be counted in order to be implemented . blood diamonds or conflict diamonds - the term generally refers to diamonds that are used to fuel conflicts , even fund conflicts - and sounds quite dramatic .
give us some sense of exactly the nature of oppression or violence that 's unleashed on people who are caught up in these sorts of situations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands in sierra leone suffered amputations during the country 's civil war well you 've taken a very interesting question here actually , because the definition of conflict diamonds themselves can be quite problematic .
the classical definition that the kimberley process uses is diamonds that are used by rebel groups to fuel armed conflicts against legitimate governments .
that 's the kind of thing we saw for example in sierra leone , where rebel groups were forcing local communities to mine for diamonds in order to buy more arms .
we saw terrible abuse against local people : murders , amputations and so on .
the issues we 're seeing today , for example in zimbabwe , are slightly different because here we 're talking not about rebel groups forcing people to mine and abusing people but actually government groups , the armed forces , even police , who are committing many of the same acts : forced labor , rape , murder , beatings of local people , but this time not by a rebel group but by a recognized government force . which leads us back to the charles taylor trial .
some experts have said that the scope of this trial goes far beyond the taylor case itself and the appearance or not of a star like naomi campbell , but it takes us to the issue of heads of state abusing their citizens , and that these leaders could later find themselves in the dock over the issue . yes , absolutely .
i think that the charles taylor trial is quite trailblazing in this way , it will send a message - a very strong message - to leaders of countries that , actually , this kind of behavior will not be tolerated by the international community .
that we will come after them , as it were , to hold them accountable for any abuse committed against their citizens .
and i think that 's a very positive and strong message to be sending out at this time . interview : ranjitha balasubramanyam -lrb- skt -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

apple is aware of the problem , but the company has n't yet said when it will fix it . the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- said in a statement on wednesday that apple 's mobile operating system has " two critical weak points for which no patch exists . "
the bonn-based agency said that due to the flaws in the ios operating system , " opening a manipulated website or a pdf file could allow criminals to spy on passwords , photos , text messages , e-mails and even listen in to phone conversations . "
" this allows potential attackers access to the complete system , including administrator rights , " it added , urging users not to open pdf files on their mobile devices and only use trustworthy websites until apple publishes a software update .
the warning relates to iphones using ios versions 3.1.2-4.0.1 . , ipads using ios 3.2-3.2.1 and ipod touches using ios 3.1.2.-4.0 .
bsi said it was not clear whether older ios or iphone os versions could also be affected .
while using their mobile devices , users should not only stay clear of pdf files they get via e-mail , but also of those found via search engines , as they could be infected too , bsi said .
the agency said it had been in contact with apple concerning the issue .
a worm in the near future ?
a spokesman for apple germany , georg albrecht , told the associated press that the company is looking into the matter .
" we know these reports and are investigating them , " he said , refusing to elaborate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple ceo steve jobs introduced the new iphone 4 at a conference in june some media reports quoted an apple spokesperson as saying that the company had developed a fix , which would become available to customers along in an upcoming software update .

" the key piece of information we are missing is when will the update come ? " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , a uk and us-based developer and vendor of security software and hardware , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we just have to hope that the update will be soon rather than months away . "
" the other thing is how many hackers will exploit this flaw .
if we really begin to see hackers exploiting this flaw , then it will be even more urgent that we see an early patch coming from apple . "
will other hackers follow suit ?
while acknowledging that no attacks have been observed yet , bsi warned that " it has to be expected that hackers will soon use the weak spots for attacks . "
the agency noted that the devices ' popularity could lead to attacks within the corporate world , possibly leading to aiding industrial espionage .
most analysts were n't really surprised by news of the security flaws .
" although we did n't know about this particular flaw , we all thought that it was most likely that the iphone would be targeted via the browser , " cluley said .
" we thought the browser , which is mobile safari , has been the weak link . "
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at helsinki-based computer security firm f-secure , agrees that the " vulnerability is definitely something to worry about . "
while pointing out " that there is no immediate danger as there are no known attacks at the moment , " hypponen told deutsche welle in an e-mail .
" this could change at any moment , and there 's still no patch available . "
however , he said that hackers may take advantage of this vulnerability soon .
" i 'm guessing we 'll see some sort of an iphone worm within a week , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bsi warning relates to ipads as well as iphones and ipods jailbreak revealed loopholes the security loophole came to the fore after a new " jailbreaking " website , jailbreakme.com , revealed the flaw over the weekend .
jailbreaking is a process that allows iphone , ipad and ipod touch users to run third-party unsigned code on the devices , instead of only apple-authorized software .
sophos ' technology expert cluley said it 's ironic that this particular flaw was brought to light via a jailbreaking website .
" certainly something apple do n't really approve of is jailbreaking – them doing that which is relatively benign , has opened the door and given the idea potentially to other hackers to exploit it for malicious reasons , " he said .
stressing that " we have n't seen malicious attacks using this vulnerability yet , " cluley warned that " it would effectively put iphones in a similar camp to windows users .
so just visiting a website on your iphone could initiate malicious code to run on your iphone . "
earlier this year , the german government had warned of the risk of having computers infected via microsoft 's internet explorer owing to security gaps in the operating systems .
however , cluley added that it 's not absolutely essential for governments to warn people about such threats given that there are adequate warnings in the media .
" people will make up their own minds about what sort of action to take about it , " he said .

the bank allegedly encouraged investors to bet against the same mortgages it was financing . deutsche bank has found itself under scrutiny by the us securities exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , just one month after goldman sachs settled fraud allegations for $ 550 million -lrb- 417 million euros -rrb- , and one week after citigroup agreed to pay a $ 75 million settlement .
the wall street journal reported tuesday that deutsche bank is one of several financial institutions being examined by the sec amid allegations it encouraged investment in the housing market while betting on its imminent collapse .
a deutsche bank trader created an index in 2006 to make betting against subprime home loans easier , and actively encouraged clients to do so .
at the same time , the bank was financing subprime lenders on the brink of collapse , such as the now-defunct novastar financial .
own money used the bank also used its own money to make tens of millions of dollars from short bets in the housing market .
however , it told the wall street journal that it " maintained a net long position in the housing market and ultimately suffered billions in losses , even after factoring in our hedges and offsetting positions . "
federal money was later used bail out the american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- , which had insured volatile deutsche bank mortgage securities .
deutsche bank recently agreed to pay $ 7.5 million to the financial industry regulatory authority , but neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .
it is also fighting a fraud-and-misrepresentation lawsuit against m & t bank in a new york state court .
m & t lost 98 percent of an $ 82 million investment in a deutsche bank deal over a period of 10 months .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

ninety-one people died in the attack . following months of negotiations , germany has agreed to pay $ 5,000 -lrb- 3,800 euros -rrb- per family in compensation to the victims of a deadly airstrike in northern afghanistan last year .
lawyers representing the victims had initially demanded far higher compensation , in some cases as high as 28,000 euros per person .
the compensation is officially being branded as " humanitarian aid " to avoid legal disputes . a spokesman for the german defense ministry told the associated press on thursday that an independent local mediator had met with village elders to identify the families of the 91 afghans who were killed , as well as 11 other afghans seriously injured in the attack .
according to the online edition of stern news magazine , the afghanistan independent human rights commission was also involved .
' long overdue ' an official report by the nato-led international security assistance force in afghanistan said last september 's attack , ordered by a german commander on two fuel trucks hijacked by the taliban in the kunduz region , killed or injured up to 142 people .
many of them were civilians . " the compensation is long overdue , " bernhard docke , a lawyer for the victims , told news agency dpa .
" it 's a shame that it took so long . "
however , docke believes $ 5,000 is not an adequate amount , and said he plans to negotiate whether further claims can be enforced .
the ministry expects to finalize the payments later in august .
the total bill for german taxpayers will likely be about $ 500,000 .

club president asare bediako brempong and his fellow members meet regularly to listen to deutsche welle programmes .
in his latest club report asare informed us : “ we have weekly discussions of events in germany and europe , e.g. the new discovery of gas in poland and its benefits to eu as well as talks with the staff of a senior high school on events in africa today .
we plan to make an excursion to kintampo waterfalls and are thinking of printing dw shirts from our weekly contributions . ” shivendu paul is the president of the metali listeners ’ club in murshidabad , west bengal , india and sent in the club ’ s latest report , informing us that club members have organized a free coaching centre for poor family students .
the club also organizes blood donations when the government blood bank is not in a position to do so , making sure that children suffering from thalassemia receive blood transfusions when necessary . members are also working together with the murshidabad eye care and donation society in connection with cornea replacement .
shivendu paul also went on to write : “ we listen to various programmes from different international radio stations , analysing the contents and creativity and we pass on our findings to the broadcasters in question .
we hold a dx meeting each month and carry out social activities .
we celebrated the 150th birth date of the poet rabindranath tagore with a cultural programme .
around 150 people joined in and local children as well as our coaching centre students participated by reciting the poems and singing the songs of that noble poet . ” mrefe akpotu of the dw listeners ’ club in warri , delta state / nigeria continues to mail us , letting us know that he and his fellow members are doing quite well and that club activities are moving on smoothly . ”
mrefe also wrote : “ we have opened up a new chapter monitoring what the papers say about our area being the heart beat of the restive niger delta region of nigeria .
and we have a mouthful of slips and details to pass on to our people .
the main aim of this venture is just to sensitize them on the need to watch out for underground plans to make the area unsafe . we also collate details from various shortwave stations and satellite tv using our various cable connections and dishes . ” jaisakthivel , president of the ardic dx club in terunelveli , tamil nadu , india , informed us that he has been made assistant professor in the department of communication at the manonmaniam sundaranar university and we congratulate him on his new post .

for this purpose our club conducted a meeting on the topic “ future of broadcasting ” .
the meeting was held in the university .
most of our club members participated and some of the all india radio technical department staff also joined us .
the first august week is the world breast feeding week .
for that our club plans to organize a public awareness campaign in tirunelveli .
members are writing the script for the skit .
we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .
if we are successful , we will have saved lives thereby contributing to progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals .
in india , for example , this means 250,000 neonates can be saved from death annually by just this one act .
initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is thus the first and most vital step towards reducing infant and under-five mortality . ” the last club in this month ’ s club corner is the deutsche welle listeners ’ club in gboko / benue state , nigeria .
club president tanko b. marbo , informed us of their last general meeting , which was attended by 27 members and he had this to add : “ concerning dw programmes , club members still commend the superb quality of dw-radio programmes and their presentation .
top of the list includes newslink , inside europe , pulse , art on the air , world in progress , sports report , inbox and spectrum . we have not given up on our adult literacy classes , basic health care or enlightenment and income-generation skills- acquisition programmes . ” as usual , many thanks to all club members who manage to put in so much time caring for others as well as listening to our programs , discussing them with fellow members - and contacting us .

most of our club members participated and some of the all india radio technical department staff also joined us .
the first august week is the world breast feeding week .

members are writing the script for the skit .
we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .
if we are successful , we will have saved lives thereby contributing to progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals .
in india , for example , this means 250,000 neonates can be saved from death annually by just this one act .
initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is thus the first and most vital step towards reducing infant and under-five mortality . ” the last club in this month ’ s club corner is the deutsche welle listeners ’ club in gboko / benue state , nigeria .

club president asare bediako brempong and his fellow members meet regularly to listen to deutsche welle programmes .
in his latest club report asare informed us : “ we have weekly discussions of events in germany and europe , e.g. the new discovery of gas in poland and its benefits to eu as well as talks with the staff of a senior high school on events in africa today .
we plan to make an excursion to kintampo waterfalls and are thinking of printing dw shirts from our weekly contributions . ” shivendu paul is the president of the metali listeners ’ club in murshidabad , west bengal , india and sent in the club ’ s latest report , informing us that club members have organized a free coaching centre for poor family students .
the club also organizes blood donations when the government blood bank is not in a position to do so , making sure that children suffering from thalassemia receive blood transfusions when necessary . members are also working together with the murshidabad eye care and donation society in connection with cornea replacement .
shivendu paul also went on to write : “ we listen to various programmes from different international radio stations , analysing the contents and creativity and we pass on our findings to the broadcasters in question .
we hold a dx meeting each month and carry out social activities .
we celebrated the 150th birth date of the poet rabindranath tagore with a cultural programme .
around 150 people joined in and local children as well as our coaching centre students participated by reciting the poems and singing the songs of that noble poet . ” mrefe akpotu of the dw listeners ’ club in warri , delta state / nigeria continues to mail us , letting us know that he and his fellow members are doing quite well and that club activities are moving on smoothly . ”
mrefe also wrote : “ we have opened up a new chapter monitoring what the papers say about our area being the heart beat of the restive niger delta region of nigeria .
and we have a mouthful of slips and details to pass on to our people .
the main aim of this venture is just to sensitize them on the need to watch out for underground plans to make the area unsafe . we also collate details from various shortwave stations and satellite tv using our various cable connections and dishes . ” jaisakthivel , president of the ardic dx club in terunelveli , tamil nadu , india , informed us that he has been made assistant professor in the department of communication at the manonmaniam sundaranar university and we congratulate him on his new post .
jaisakthivel also sent in the following report after the july club meeting had taken place on the university campus . “ this month we concentrated on the new technology of drm and dab .
here in india most of our club members and the short wave listeners don ’ t know about this technology .
for this purpose our club conducted a meeting on the topic “ future of broadcasting ” .
the meeting was held in the university .
most of our club members participated and some of the all india radio technical department staff also joined us .
the first august week is the world breast feeding week .
for that our club plans to organize a public awareness campaign in tirunelveli .
members are writing the script for the skit .
we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .
if we are successful , we will have saved lives thereby contributing to progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals .
in india , for example , this means 250,000 neonates can be saved from death annually by just this one act .
initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is thus the first and most vital step towards reducing infant and under-five mortality . ” the last club in this month ’ s club corner is the deutsche welle listeners ’ club in gboko / benue state , nigeria .
club president tanko b. marbo , informed us of their last general meeting , which was attended by 27 members and he had this to add : “ concerning dw programmes , club members still commend the superb quality of dw-radio programmes and their presentation .

we hold a dx meeting each month and carry out social activities .
we celebrated the 150th birth date of the poet rabindranath tagore with a cultural programme .
around 150 people joined in and local children as well as our coaching centre students participated by reciting the poems and singing the songs of that noble poet . ” mrefe akpotu of the dw listeners ’ club in warri , delta state / nigeria continues to mail us , letting us know that he and his fellow members are doing quite well and that club activities are moving on smoothly . ”
mrefe also wrote : “ we have opened up a new chapter monitoring what the papers say about our area being the heart beat of the restive niger delta region of nigeria .
and we have a mouthful of slips and details to pass on to our people .
the main aim of this venture is just to sensitize them on the need to watch out for underground plans to make the area unsafe . we also collate details from various shortwave stations and satellite tv using our various cable connections and dishes . ” jaisakthivel , president of the ardic dx club in terunelveli , tamil nadu , india , informed us that he has been made assistant professor in the department of communication at the manonmaniam sundaranar university and we congratulate him on his new post .
jaisakthivel also sent in the following report after the july club meeting had taken place on the university campus . “ this month we concentrated on the new technology of drm and dab .
here in india most of our club members and the short wave listeners don ’ t know about this technology .
for this purpose our club conducted a meeting on the topic “ future of broadcasting ” .
the meeting was held in the university .
most of our club members participated and some of the all india radio technical department staff also joined us .
the first august week is the world breast feeding week .
for that our club plans to organize a public awareness campaign in tirunelveli .
members are writing the script for the skit .
we have an opportunity to inform people of the benefits that early and exclusive breastfeeding provides to both families and nations .
if we are successful , we will have saved lives thereby contributing to progress towards the achievement of the millennium development goals .
in india , for example , this means 250,000 neonates can be saved from death annually by just this one act .
initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth is thus the first and most vital step towards reducing infant and under-five mortality . ” the last club in this month ’ s club corner is the deutsche welle listeners ’ club in gboko / benue state , nigeria .
club president tanko b. marbo , informed us of their last general meeting , which was attended by 27 members and he had this to add : “ concerning dw programmes , club members still commend the superb quality of dw-radio programmes and their presentation .
top of the list includes newslink , inside europe , pulse , art on the air , world in progress , sports report , inbox and spectrum . we have not given up on our adult literacy classes , basic health care or enlightenment and income-generation skills- acquisition programmes . ” as usual , many thanks to all club members who manage to put in so much time caring for others as well as listening to our programs , discussing them with fellow members - and contacting us .
well done and keep up the good work . we would like to mention the fact that , here at the english service , all active clubs are considered to be part of our deutsche welle family – and all are appreciated by us .
there is no registration list .
all the best to all our listeners ' clubs wherever you may be .
