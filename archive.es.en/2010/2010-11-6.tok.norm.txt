meanwhile , a journalist for a leading newspaper has been severely beaten and is in a coma . russian president dmitry medvedev overturned a bill to restrict freedom of assembly saturday , in a move that surprised russia 's rights activists . medvedev vetoed a bill passed by russian parliament in october that would make it illegal for those convicted of planning illegal rallies in the past to organize new demonstrations . in an open letter to the two chambers of parliament , medvedev explained his decision by saying that the amendment contradicted the right to assembly guaranteed by the russian constitution . " the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .
afterwards pilgrims line up for the rubber stamp proving they 've walked the last 100 kilometers or bicycled or rode at least the last 200 kilometers to santiago de compostella .
the certificate or compostela also carries an indulgence , allowing the forgiveness of sins and shortening the time spent in purgatory .

all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .
afterwards pilgrims line up for the rubber stamp proving they 've walked the last 100 kilometers or bicycled or rode at least the last 200 kilometers to santiago de compostella .
the certificate or compostela also carries an indulgence , allowing the forgiveness of sins and shortening the time spent in purgatory .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .
they do n't see the bailout package as a result of our debt crisis , they find it to be the other way round : the crisis comes as a result of the bailout package , they say .
but this is simply not true . " challenges from within polls show papandreou is more popular than samaras , but they also point to a defeat for many government-backed candidates in the local vote .
gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .
" the prime minister was forced to take the challenge and attack his opponents .
he just had to react , for he knew that growing opposition to the bailout deal might cost him his job . " opposition is growing even within the governing socialist party .
deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos recently implied that debt restructuring for greece - which may be the only alternative to default - is not completely off the table .
jannis michas , a close ally of papandreou who is running for mayor in the city of piraeus , took this idea and called for restructuring of the city 's debt . new reality for greece maria xirotyri , a greek-australian businesswoman who runs her own consulting business in athens , said people in greece need to adjust to a new reality .
she said the current troubles are due to previous governments making the wrong decisions , and that today she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amid massive public unrest , the government has little reason for optimism " we have reduced our prices and we have created better paying conditions for our customers , " she said .
" so in terms of the company we are okay .
generally though , the feeling is one of anxiety and worrying and disappointment . " for the government , there is not much reason to be optimistic .

" the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .
afterwards pilgrims line up for the rubber stamp proving they 've walked the last 100 kilometers or bicycled or rode at least the last 200 kilometers to santiago de compostella .
the certificate or compostela also carries an indulgence , allowing the forgiveness of sins and shortening the time spent in purgatory .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 06.11.2010 pope treads the pilgrim path to santiago de compostela großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of pilgrims set out on the st james way each year as pope benedict xvi visits santiago de compostela on saturday , he joins a long line of pilgrims who make their way to the third most holy place in the roman catholic world after jerusalem and rome . there are many ways to santiago de compostela .
in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .
afterwards pilgrims line up for the rubber stamp proving they 've walked the last 100 kilometers or bicycled or rode at least the last 200 kilometers to santiago de compostella .
the certificate or compostela also carries an indulgence , allowing the forgiveness of sins and shortening the time spent in purgatory .

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .

the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

the inspections were advised by the british engine manufacturer . a qantas airways plane made an emergency landing in singapore on friday , less two days after another of the australian carrier 's jets had to land prematurely due to engine failure . the boeing 747-400 aircraft , with 412 people on board headed to sydney , returned to the airport 20 minutes after takeoff in a move qantas ' head alan joyce said was a " mechanical failure of the engine .

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .
they do n't see the bailout package as a result of our debt crisis , they find it to be the other way round : the crisis comes as a result of the bailout package , they say .
but this is simply not true . " challenges from within polls show papandreou is more popular than samaras , but they also point to a defeat for many government-backed candidates in the local vote .
gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .
" the prime minister was forced to take the challenge and attack his opponents .
he just had to react , for he knew that growing opposition to the bailout deal might cost him his job . " opposition is growing even within the governing socialist party .
deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos recently implied that debt restructuring for greece - which may be the only alternative to default - is not completely off the table .
jannis michas , a close ally of papandreou who is running for mayor in the city of piraeus , took this idea and called for restructuring of the city 's debt . new reality for greece maria xirotyri , a greek-australian businesswoman who runs her own consulting business in athens , said people in greece need to adjust to a new reality .
she said the current troubles are due to previous governments making the wrong decisions , and that today she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amid massive public unrest , the government has little reason for optimism " we have reduced our prices and we have created better paying conditions for our customers , " she said .
" so in terms of the company we are okay .
generally though , the feeling is one of anxiety and worrying and disappointment . " for the government , there is not much reason to be optimistic .
right after regional elections , a group of international experts will visit athens with a view to the 2011 budget . at the same time , the eu statistics agency eurostat may once again revise greece 's deficit figures .
many believe that by the end of the year the government may have to introduce additional austerity measures to meet targets . author : jannis papadimitriou , athens -lrb- acb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .

the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .
working nation in a separate media interview , the chancellor said full employment in germany was a realistic target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .
she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

meanwhile , a journalist for a leading newspaper has been severely beaten and is in a coma . russian president dmitry medvedev overturned a bill to restrict freedom of assembly saturday , in a move that surprised russia 's rights activists . medvedev vetoed a bill passed by russian parliament in october that would make it illegal for those convicted of planning illegal rallies in the past to organize new demonstrations . in an open letter to the two chambers of parliament , medvedev explained his decision by saying that the amendment contradicted the right to assembly guaranteed by the russian constitution . " the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .
working nation in a separate media interview , the chancellor said full employment in germany was a realistic target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .
she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .
working nation in a separate media interview , the chancellor said full employment in germany was a realistic target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .
she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .

she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

meanwhile , a journalist for a leading newspaper has been severely beaten and is in a coma . russian president dmitry medvedev overturned a bill to restrict freedom of assembly saturday , in a move that surprised russia 's rights activists . medvedev vetoed a bill passed by russian parliament in october that would make it illegal for those convicted of planning illegal rallies in the past to organize new demonstrations . in an open letter to the two chambers of parliament , medvedev explained his decision by saying that the amendment contradicted the right to assembly guaranteed by the russian constitution . " the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .
afterwards pilgrims line up for the rubber stamp proving they 've walked the last 100 kilometers or bicycled or rode at least the last 200 kilometers to santiago de compostella .
the certificate or compostela also carries an indulgence , allowing the forgiveness of sins and shortening the time spent in purgatory .

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

meanwhile , a journalist for a leading newspaper has been severely beaten and is in a coma . russian president dmitry medvedev overturned a bill to restrict freedom of assembly saturday , in a move that surprised russia 's rights activists . medvedev vetoed a bill passed by russian parliament in october that would make it illegal for those convicted of planning illegal rallies in the past to organize new demonstrations . in an open letter to the two chambers of parliament , medvedev explained his decision by saying that the amendment contradicted the right to assembly guaranteed by the russian constitution . " the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , a journalist for a leading newspaper has been severely beaten and is in a coma . russian president dmitry medvedev overturned a bill to restrict freedom of assembly saturday , in a move that surprised russia 's rights activists . medvedev vetoed a bill passed by russian parliament in october that would make it illegal for those convicted of planning illegal rallies in the past to organize new demonstrations . in an open letter to the two chambers of parliament , medvedev explained his decision by saying that the amendment contradicted the right to assembly guaranteed by the russian constitution . " the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .
working nation in a separate media interview , the chancellor said full employment in germany was a realistic target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .
she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .

he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .

gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .
working nation in a separate media interview , the chancellor said full employment in germany was a realistic target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .
she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .
they do n't see the bailout package as a result of our debt crisis , they find it to be the other way round : the crisis comes as a result of the bailout package , they say .
but this is simply not true . " challenges from within polls show papandreou is more popular than samaras , but they also point to a defeat for many government-backed candidates in the local vote .
gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .
" the prime minister was forced to take the challenge and attack his opponents .
he just had to react , for he knew that growing opposition to the bailout deal might cost him his job . " opposition is growing even within the governing socialist party .
deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos recently implied that debt restructuring for greece - which may be the only alternative to default - is not completely off the table .
jannis michas , a close ally of papandreou who is running for mayor in the city of piraeus , took this idea and called for restructuring of the city 's debt . new reality for greece maria xirotyri , a greek-australian businesswoman who runs her own consulting business in athens , said people in greece need to adjust to a new reality .
she said the current troubles are due to previous governments making the wrong decisions , and that today she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amid massive public unrest , the government has little reason for optimism " we have reduced our prices and we have created better paying conditions for our customers , " she said .
" so in terms of the company we are okay .
generally though , the feeling is one of anxiety and worrying and disappointment . " for the government , there is not much reason to be optimistic .
right after regional elections , a group of international experts will visit athens with a view to the 2011 budget . at the same time , the eu statistics agency eurostat may once again revise greece 's deficit figures .
many believe that by the end of the year the government may have to introduce additional austerity measures to meet targets . author : jannis papadimitriou , athens -lrb- acb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , a journalist for a leading newspaper has been severely beaten and is in a coma . russian president dmitry medvedev overturned a bill to restrict freedom of assembly saturday , in a move that surprised russia 's rights activists . medvedev vetoed a bill passed by russian parliament in october that would make it illegal for those convicted of planning illegal rallies in the past to organize new demonstrations . in an open letter to the two chambers of parliament , medvedev explained his decision by saying that the amendment contradicted the right to assembly guaranteed by the russian constitution . " the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian police are quick to break up opposition protests deemed unauthorized however , the kremlin said the president had not entirely rejected the idea of an amendment to the constitution 's freedom of assembly clause . activists pleased human rights activists and members of the opposition welcomed the announcement by the president – who is not known for promoting freedom of expression . " we do n't need this law , " said lyudmila alexeyeva , leader of the human rights organization moscow helsinki group , according to the news agency interfax .
" in russia the right to stage demonstrations is already restricted enough . " veteran campaigner and the head of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva , said the new law would have limited the people 's right to freedom of assembly . " it is sensible that our president saw all the risks in the bill for the authorities and the senselessness of the law , " she added . russian police have regularly cracked down on opposition demonstrations deemed to be unauthorized .
however , some observers have detected a new climate of tolerance since moscow mayor yuri luzhkov was ousted in september . the kremlin surprised many last month by clearly stating that authorities would not stop opposition protests of 200 people in central moscow . journalist in a coma after beating yet , even as the kremlin relaxed its stance on opposition rallies , the bludgeoning of a russian journalist suggested the country still has a long way to go in protecting freedom of expression . oleg kashin , a political journalist with the kommersant daily , was beaten friday night near his home .
doctors induced a coma after kashin was admitted to hospital with two broken legs , a damaged skull and a fractured jaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oleg kashin 's editor said the attack was likely linked to his coverage of opposition groups the assailants did not steal kashin 's wallet or telephone – indications that the crime was related to his work , according to kommersant editor mikhail mikhailin . president dmitry medvedev ordered the prosecutor general and interior minister to " take special control of the investigation , " a kremlin spokesman said . journalist rights groups have criticized russian authorities for failing to solve a number of high-profile murders of media workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 06.11.2010 greek regional elections to test government 's support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou 's government was elected just a year ago greek socialist prime minister george papandreou has been facing a wave of protests due to unpopular austerity measures .
after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .
they do n't see the bailout package as a result of our debt crisis , they find it to be the other way round : the crisis comes as a result of the bailout package , they say .
but this is simply not true . " challenges from within polls show papandreou is more popular than samaras , but they also point to a defeat for many government-backed candidates in the local vote .
gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .
" the prime minister was forced to take the challenge and attack his opponents .
he just had to react , for he knew that growing opposition to the bailout deal might cost him his job . " opposition is growing even within the governing socialist party .
deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos recently implied that debt restructuring for greece - which may be the only alternative to default - is not completely off the table .
jannis michas , a close ally of papandreou who is running for mayor in the city of piraeus , took this idea and called for restructuring of the city 's debt . new reality for greece maria xirotyri , a greek-australian businesswoman who runs her own consulting business in athens , said people in greece need to adjust to a new reality .
she said the current troubles are due to previous governments making the wrong decisions , and that today she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amid massive public unrest , the government has little reason for optimism " we have reduced our prices and we have created better paying conditions for our customers , " she said .
" so in terms of the company we are okay .
generally though , the feeling is one of anxiety and worrying and disappointment . " for the government , there is not much reason to be optimistic .
right after regional elections , a group of international experts will visit athens with a view to the 2011 budget . at the same time , the eu statistics agency eurostat may once again revise greece 's deficit figures .
many believe that by the end of the year the government may have to introduce additional austerity measures to meet targets . author : jannis papadimitriou , athens -lrb- acb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 06.11.2010 greek regional elections to test government 's support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou 's government was elected just a year ago greek socialist prime minister george papandreou has been facing a wave of protests due to unpopular austerity measures .
after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .
they do n't see the bailout package as a result of our debt crisis , they find it to be the other way round : the crisis comes as a result of the bailout package , they say .
but this is simply not true . " challenges from within polls show papandreou is more popular than samaras , but they also point to a defeat for many government-backed candidates in the local vote .
gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .
" the prime minister was forced to take the challenge and attack his opponents .
he just had to react , for he knew that growing opposition to the bailout deal might cost him his job . " opposition is growing even within the governing socialist party .
deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos recently implied that debt restructuring for greece - which may be the only alternative to default - is not completely off the table .
jannis michas , a close ally of papandreou who is running for mayor in the city of piraeus , took this idea and called for restructuring of the city 's debt . new reality for greece maria xirotyri , a greek-australian businesswoman who runs her own consulting business in athens , said people in greece need to adjust to a new reality .
she said the current troubles are due to previous governments making the wrong decisions , and that today she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amid massive public unrest , the government has little reason for optimism " we have reduced our prices and we have created better paying conditions for our customers , " she said .
" so in terms of the company we are okay .
generally though , the feeling is one of anxiety and worrying and disappointment . " for the government , there is not much reason to be optimistic .
right after regional elections , a group of international experts will visit athens with a view to the 2011 budget . at the same time , the eu statistics agency eurostat may once again revise greece 's deficit figures .
many believe that by the end of the year the government may have to introduce additional austerity measures to meet targets . author : jannis papadimitriou , athens -lrb- acb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her comments come days before economic experts are due to unveil their expectations for germany 's future fiscal health .
" i am convinced that the ' five wise men ' -lrb- on the council of economic experts -rrb- ... will probably predict a stable period of growth in the coming years , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
the experts will present their annual analysis and predictions on wednesday .
working nation in a separate media interview , the chancellor said full employment in germany was a realistic target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment figures in germany have been dropping " i want to approach the goal of work for all , step by step , " merkel told the news magazine focus , adding that finding positions for all job-seekers was not just a utopian ideal .
she said the government spent 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.1 billion -rrb- annually on unemployment benefits for some two million people who were fit to work .
the number of unemployed in germany sunk to 2.9 million in october , the lowest level since 1992 .
" we must , and can , return these people to work , " merkel said , identifying the long-term unemployed , single parents , young germans with immigrant backgrounds and seniors as those capable of returning to the workforce .
however , the federal labor agency says full employment is still a fair way off , calculating it would not be possible until 2020 .
merkel went on to warn that the economic crisis was not yet over in the united states or the european union - in contrast with asia where she said the situation looked stable .
" the worst is behind us , but we can not yet talk about a stable global economic situation , " the chancellor said , stressing that the eu needed a stronger culture of stability to secure the euro currency .

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the law ... has aspects which would impede the realization of the constitutional right of citizens to hold gatherings , meetings , demonstrations , marches and pickets , " he wrote . demonstrations , medvedev added in the letter , were " one of the most effective forms of influence on the actions of the state .

in fact some people say the way begins at your front door .
that certainly was the case with the very first pilgrim to set off from the city of oviedo in the 9th century .
today the road he took is known as the camino primitivo or the original way and is 370 kilometers -lrb- 230 miles -rrb- long .
that first pilgrim was king alfons ii of asturias .
he was one of the founders of the first basilica built over the tomb of the apostle .
other popular roads to santiago are the northern way or camino del norte -lrb- 825 kilometers -rrb- that starts in the basque city of irun and pretty much follows the coast until ribadeo when it swings south .
the most popular is the french way or camino frances -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- from st. jean- pied-du-port in france to roncesvalles in spain then through burgos and leon .
although today the northern and french ways are more popular , the camino primitivo is again attracting pilgrims because it is not as crowded and the hostels rarely full .
gabriela broda , from poland says she chose the original way because she wanted to make sure of always finding a bed to sleep in at night .
the 31 year old said it was her first pilgrimage .
" i want to find peace within myself and make sure that everything goes all right in my life , " she said .
for religious pilgrims like gabriela broda the way is a spiritual journey but for many modern pilgrims the camino is just another way to prove their fitness .
many now spend as much as six weeks on the road , carrying their backpacks just for the fun of it .
" it 's a challenging walk but a thoroughly enjoyable one , " said alistair templeton from manchester who came to santiago along the english way from ferrol -lrb- 110 kilometers -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral was built on the spot where the remains of the apostle james were said to have been found rest for weary travelers along the way pilgrims stay at public or private hostels .
cornellana , near salas is a former monastery that offers very simple accommodations in bunk beds .
pilgrims donate what they can afford to pay , usually three to six euros -lrb- $ 4-8 -rrb- for a bed without fresh linen , and the use of the showers and a communal kitchen .
one of the best private hostels is run by donna herminia .
it is about 11 kilometers from tineo and attracts a lot of international pilgrims .
" i found out about this from another pilgrim who 'd done the route before , " said adrian arm from thun in switzerland .
adrian is typical of the young professionals who do the pilgrimage for its physical challenge . at donna herminia 's bar and private hostel a bunk bed with clean sheets costs 10 euros and pilgrims can use the washing machine .
the shop sells everything from whole serrano hams to sausages , fresh fruit and washing detergent .
" we are open 25 hours a day , " said donna herminia , a round lady with boundless energy and a smile for everyone .
for another 10 euros pilgrims get the daily menu which includes local sausages and air-dried beef , cheese , a bottle of wine , vegetable soup and the stew-of-the-day plus dessert .
" after a few days on the road , your problems do n't seem very important , " said salvador ferandellaroba from madrid .
" you start out with your head full but after a while all you can think of is putting one foot in front of the other and life becomes just a matter of finding where to sleep and getting enough to eat .
suddenly it 's very simple and you do n't care anymore about the problems with your boss or the woman waiting for you back home . "
bildunterschrift : spanish queen sofia is another famous visitor to have given the traditional hug to the image of apostle santiago historic sites ceramic signs showing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background mark the way .
the road passes through spectacular mountain scenery and towns like a fonsagrada where pilgrims can sip from the miraculous fountain -lrb- fons sacrata -rrb- which gave the town its name .
st. james himself was said to have stopped by and repaid an impoverished widow for her hospitality by turning the water in the fountain into milk .
one of the most spectacular cities along the way is lugo or lucus augusti in roman times .
the camino enters the ancient city through the gate of saint peter through the roman wall built between the 3rd and 4th centuries .
the wall , an unesco world heritage site , has 10 gates and a perimeter of 2,240 meters circling the old town .
all the various ways end in santiago de compostela where pilgrims run the gamut of stalls selling scallop shells , wooden staffs and useless plastic souvenirs .
it is truly difficult to leave the city without buying something with a scallop on it .
the tradition goes back to the middle ages where medieval pilgrims stopped off in the barrio de los conchieros to buy a scallop and eat it .
then they 'd stick the shell in the brim of their hat as proof that they 'd made the journey to santiago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legend has it that st james also preached at santiago de compostela the end of the road church officials at the archdioceses of santiago estimate that more than 200,000 people will make their way – for whatever reason – to santiago de compostela this year .
in 2004 , the last holy year , some 180,000 pilgrims walked or bicycled to the holy city .
once in santiago , pilgrims gather in the central square called praza do obradoiro .
there , pilgrims mingle and listen to the cocktail of exotic sounds led by the galician bagpipers who love playing their instruments in the echoing stone archways of the square .
didgeridoo-playing australians compete with the keening wail and church bells round off the whole in a symphony unique to santiago .
one of the most striking buildings on the obradoiro square is the 15th century hospital built by the catholic kings isabella and ferdinand in the same year columbus sailed to the americas .
the platersque pile is now one of spain 's most luxurious hotels .
" we still welcome the first ten pilgrims who come to the hotel and offer them a free breakfast , lunch or dinner , " said alvaro martìnez serra , assistant manager of the hotel .
afterwards pilgrims line up for the rubber stamp proving they 've walked the last 100 kilometers or bicycled or rode at least the last 200 kilometers to santiago de compostella .
the certificate or compostela also carries an indulgence , allowing the forgiveness of sins and shortening the time spent in purgatory .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance afghanistan -pipe- 06.11.2010 russia edges closer to afghanistan role in response to nato requests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far russia has observed afghanistan from a distance with the us and nato searching for answers to the myriad problems in afghanistan , a cautious shift in russia 's thinking may lead to moscow offering much-needed logistical and strategic support to the faltering mission . with nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen holding talks with russian president dmitry medvedev recently on the prospect of increased russian involvement in afghanistan , the nato summit later this month could take on a new significance in the context of the war in afghanistan should new initiatives between the former cold war foes be agreed . medvedev has been invited to the summit in lisbon on november 19-20 and is expected be sounded out on a number of proposed nato-russian initiatives on afghanistan that have been added to the agenda .
the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benedict lamented the belief in europe that a christian society was incongruous with freedom .
" europe must open itself to god , must come to meet him without fear , " he told 7,000 pilgrims from a vast white stage , dressed in a sweeping zigzag of purple flowers , at a giant open-air mass in santiago de compostela 's plaza obradoiro .
" tragically , above all in 19th century europe , the conviction grew that god is somehow man 's antagonist and an enemy of his freedom , " said the pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope conducted a mass in santiago " as a result , there was an attempt to obscure the true biblical faith in the god who sent into the world his son jesus christ , so that no one should perish but that all might have eternal life . "
changing land earlier , while en route to santiago , the 83-year-old pontiff told reporters that the anticlericalism seen now in spain was reminiscent of the 1930s , when the church suffered under violence and persecution as the country fell into to civil war .
" spain saw in the 1930s the birth of a strong and aggressive anticlericalism , " he told reporters on the plane from rome to spain 's holiest city , santiago de compostela , which is said to hold the remains of st james the apostle .
" the clash between faith and modernity is happening again and it is very strong today , " he said as he embarked on the two-day visit to bolster the church against social change in spain and europe including easy divorce , abortion and gay marriage .
once among europe 's most catholic countries , spanish society has witnessed rapid secularization in recent years .
the image of the church in spain was also heavily damaged for its close association with the country 's long-time dictator francisco franco .
in eight years the proportion of spaniards who describe themselves as roman catholic has dropped to 73 percent from 80 percent and those attending weekly mass to 13 percent from 20 percent .
however , thousands still turned out to hail the arrival of benedict in santiago , showering confetti and chanting " viva el papa . "
the pontiff will spend saturday in santiago de compostela before heading to barcelona in the evening and then on sunday sanctifying antoni gaudi 's unfinished masterpiece , the sagrada familia church .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .

the us and britain originally planned to pressure the europeans to provide more assistance in afghanistan at the summit but it appears that plan has now been extended to include discussions with medvedev over russia 's involvement . nato chiefs have been preparing plans to approach the russians with proposals regarding the expansion of transit routes to afghanistan , the supply of russian helicopters to the afghan military and the training of afghan soldiers and counter-narcotics units . nato officials believe that shared goals - specifically the desire to deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan , the destruction of the country 's heroin industry and the consolidation of a democratic system of government - will help persuade the russians to return to afghanistan for the first time since the defeated occupying soviet forces left the country in 1989 after a decade of war . russia takes first tentative steps in helping nato in afghanistan the signs from russia have so far been encouraging .
russian and us operatives were involved in an unprecedented joint anti-narcotics operation in afghanistan recently while russia started shipping small arms to afghanistan 's police forces earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's use of choppers in afghanistan could benefit nato nato hopes that russia will follow this up by responding to requests to supply helicopters and crews to train afghan pilots .
nato planners consider russian helicopters to be better-suited to afghanistan 's landscape and the nature of the war , and that russian crews , which gained considerable experience in flying helicopter gunships during the soviet occupation , can provide afghan pilots with better training for the conflicts they face . " russia is more active in afghanistan than a year ago , " stanislav secrieru , associate researcher at the center for east european and asian studies in bucharest , told deutsche welle . " however , this does not come as a result of a shift in perceptions about nato in moscow , which are likely to remain suspicious for some time .
partially it is an effect of the us reset policy with russia .
thus , moscow sees the opportunity to reciprocate to nato and the us cooperative overtures . " despite a cautious shift toward involvement in afghanistan , the stumbling block to russia fully committing to a role in the war will be any request to put russian ground troops into action in the country . memory of afghan occupation and defeat haunts russia the defeat to the mujahedeen in the late-1980s is still an open sore for the russian military and while moscow may consider sending soldiers to train afghan national security forces and border patrols , it is very unlikely that any troops will be deployed in the country in an offensive capability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is unwilling to commit ground troops to the mission " russia does n't want to be involved in afghanistan , " alain deletroz , the european vice president of the international crisis group think-tank , told deutsche welle .
" it had its time there and it has enough of it .
but it does n't want to see nato losing and the taliban back , with their potential to create troubles in the rest of central asia and even in the north caucasus . " to have russian military trainers on the ground in afghanistan and in the border regions , along with russian hardware supplying the afghan forces , would be a small yet significant victory for nato and the us .
should the russians agree to improved air and land supply and transit arrangements via central asian states such as kyrgyzstan and tajikistan , both nato and the us could rightly celebrate an even greater success . russian opposition to routes through its territory and former soviet states has meant that nato has had to make use of more dangerous supply routes through pakistan which has led to increased attacks on supply convoys and combat deaths .
the situation has been made more difficult by a recent pakistani government decision to temporarily close the khyber pass . russian involvement could ease some of obama 's afghan worries any change of direction over afghanistan by russia could be seen as a victory for beleaguered us president barack obama .
after getting a bloody nose in the midterm elections in which republicans captured control of the house of representatives from his democrats , obama is desperate for good news , especially in afghanistan .
support for the on-going operation is faltering back in the us and obama 's perceived inability to bring an end to the conflict amost certainly contributed to his party ’ s battering at the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama needs medvedev but russia has its own goals nato cooperation with russia is also seen by the obama administration as a crucial part of his plans to ' reset ' the relationship with moscow after the post-cold war depths plumbed by george w. bush and vladimir putin .
good relations with russia are integral to obama 's belief that us and global security hinges on cooperation between the two nations . " since the reset button has been pushed , cooperation between the us and russia in afghanistan has intensified , " secrieru said . the united states and nato are under no illusion that russia would be helping out of the goodness of its heart .
russian interests in the region will be always be at the heart of any geo-political decision taken by moscow . " firstly , russia wants security along its southern periphery , " said secrieru .
" secondly , russia has commercial interests in afghanistan .
russian officials have talked about possible implication of russian companies ' in rebuilding afghan infrastructure .
it is also an opportunity to boost russian arms sales .
thirdly , russia wants greater political influence in afghanistan . " " the cold war patterns of thinking are still very much enshrined in the minds of the security services in the us and in moscow , " alain deletroz concluded .
" but the us and nato have no choice : afghanistan 's neighbors must stop playing games with nato if they really want to see the taliban defeated .
moscow is simply realizing that now .
it may be a bit late but better late than never . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 06.11.2010 greek regional elections to test government 's support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou 's government was elected just a year ago greek socialist prime minister george papandreou has been facing a wave of protests due to unpopular austerity measures .
after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .

after only one year in power , he is urging greeks to show their confidence in the government . greek voters go to the polls on sunday in local elections widely seen as crash test for prime minister papandreou and his austerity program , and the vote is set to be the most polarized greek election in years . papandreou has said he may seek a fresh mandate for his government and call early elections if voters do not back socialist candidates .
but with the greek economy shrinking and unemployment at 12 percent , many voters are expected to abstain and turn their backs on the political system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many voters are unhappy with papandreou and conservative samaras according to electoral law an absolute majority of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a candidate to be elected mayor or regional governor on the first round of elections .
this means many municipalities and regions will likely have to hold a second round on november 14 . populist anger on the right antonis samaras , head of the main conservative opposition , also faces a key leadership test .
he refused to back the bailout and now leads the resistance against the austerity program imposed by the european union and the international monetary fund . but voters should not be fooled by the populist rhetoric that greece could bypass the reform program , according to dionysis gousetis , a political analyst in athens . " conservative leader samaras promises to reduce the deficit to near-zero , operating with incorrect statistics , " he told deutsche welle .
" as for the left parties , they simply say we should cheat our creditors .
they do n't see the bailout package as a result of our debt crisis , they find it to be the other way round : the crisis comes as a result of the bailout package , they say .
but this is simply not true . " challenges from within polls show papandreou is more popular than samaras , but they also point to a defeat for many government-backed candidates in the local vote .
gousetis said he believes papandreou has no choice but to raise the stakes for his own party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has had to confront his opponents aggressively " both the right and left opposition have described this vote as a referendum on the government 's austerity program , " he said .
" the prime minister was forced to take the challenge and attack his opponents .
he just had to react , for he knew that growing opposition to the bailout deal might cost him his job . " opposition is growing even within the governing socialist party .
deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos recently implied that debt restructuring for greece - which may be the only alternative to default - is not completely off the table .
jannis michas , a close ally of papandreou who is running for mayor in the city of piraeus , took this idea and called for restructuring of the city 's debt . new reality for greece maria xirotyri , a greek-australian businesswoman who runs her own consulting business in athens , said people in greece need to adjust to a new reality .
she said the current troubles are due to previous governments making the wrong decisions , and that today she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amid massive public unrest , the government has little reason for optimism " we have reduced our prices and we have created better paying conditions for our customers , " she said .
" so in terms of the company we are okay .
generally though , the feeling is one of anxiety and worrying and disappointment . " for the government , there is not much reason to be optimistic .
right after regional elections , a group of international experts will visit athens with a view to the 2011 budget . at the same time , the eu statistics agency eurostat may once again revise greece 's deficit figures .
many believe that by the end of the year the government may have to introduce additional austerity measures to meet targets . author : jannis papadimitriou , athens -lrb- acb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
