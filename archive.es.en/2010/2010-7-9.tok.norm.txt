one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .

but as a city with more hipsters per square mile than most , berlin has a rather diy approach to high-end fashion . i do n't consider myself to be a particularly fashionable person .
i do n't read all the glossy mags , i seldom visit flagship stores , and i certainly do n't talk down my nose to someone wearing something deemed " so last year . " i 'm quite happy to roll out of bed , pull on a tattered , crumpled t-shirt and a pair of yesterday 's socks and go to work . i suppose , thinking about it , by berlin standards i am quite fashionable in the sense that i wear what i want and do n't care a hoot about what anyone thinks . of course the common misconception is that the fashion business is a glitzy , glamorous affair but , like all misconceptions , this is a load of old rubbish and in berlin especially , with its low-budget do-it-yourself approach to everything , it is a particularly shabby affair . the grime behind the glitz i myself have done several photo shoots for glossy magazines and the thrill of being photographed evaporated almost the instant i was dressed like someone who had fallen out of the sky and landed in a jumble sale .
that pretty much sums up a photo shoot ; you arrive at silly o 'clock in the morning , are dressed like an extra from the star wars cantina and have to stand and stand and stand all day long in the most ridiculous poses .

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .
though the case has received widespread media coverage - with one of the spies , anna chapman , becoming a tabloid sensation due to nude photographs of the 28-year-old that have surfaced on the internet - the spy ring appears to have been amateurish and made little impact in the decade since being formed .
" no significant national security benefit would be gained from the prolonged incarceration in the united states of these 10 unlawful agents , " state department spokesman mark toner in response to the quick release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secret agents are prohibited reentrance to the us in exchange for the agents , moscow agreed to release four russians detained in the country for spying for western countries .
a plane carrying the freed western spies has landed in washington .
nuclear expert included in russian pardon a spokesman for president dmitry medvedev confirmed late on thursday that the four russians would be pardoned , including arms control expert igor sutyagin .
a lawyer for sutyagin , who was sent to the frozen wastelands of arkhangelsk in northern russia after being convicted in 2004 , said her client was being flown to vienna .
also to be exchanged was sergei skripal , a former colonel with russian military intelligence sentenced in 2006 to 13 years jail on charges of spying for britain . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of spies from east and west were freed at glienicke the remaining two were alexander zaporozhsky , a former employee of the russian foreign intelligence service who was jailed for 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and a fourth man called gennadi vasilenko .
the exchange of captured agents between western and eastern powers was common practice during the cold war , with the swaps sometimes occurring on the glienicke bridge between east germany and west berlin .
the last high-profile swap took place in 1984 , when us journalist nicholas daniloff was expelled from russia the day before gennady zakharov , a soviet official at the united nations , was sent back to moscow after briefly appearing before a new york court .

the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 09.07.2010 opinion : no sign of a return to the cold war after spy swap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-russia spy affair does not signify a rift between the two countries .
on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.07.2010 german national team jerseys are a hot item in a hot summer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's performance has boosted jersey sales a young , captivating german soccer team competing in the world cup and a hot summer have been a huge boost for sportswear sales in germany .
the national black away jersey has sold out in much of the country . adidas , the official outfitter of the german national team and several others competing in the 2010 world cup , was expecting good sportswear sales in germany but had n't expected them to go quite as wild as they have .
numerous retailers across the country ran out of the official jerseys , particularly the elegant black away ones , just days into the global soccer event .
and that was despite the fact that adidas sold one million of the shirts to retailers worldwide ahead of the tournament , and has delivered an additional 200,000 since the kick-off in june .
' super satisfied ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black jersey of the german national team is sold out in 2006 , when the world cup was held in germany , adidas sold slightly more german jerseys worldwide - 1.5 million .
but this time round , it has done better overall .
figures for the sale of all adidas-sponsored squad shirts have more than doubled to reach a total of 6.5 million .
" we 're super satisfied with sales , " adidas spokeswoman kirsten keck , told deutsche welle .
adidas would probably be even happier if retailers had anticipated the booming demand for german national team jerseys and ordered more from the start , particularly given the none too flexible recommended retail price of 69.95 euros -lrb- $ 88.00 -rrb- .
the home and away sets of jerseys and shorts will be restocked and available until a new line of gear is introduced toward the end of next year , several months ahead of the upcoming european tournament , according to michael lipsky , store manager of the sportarena branch in bonn .
waiting for more " we wo n't reduce the price of the german national team jerseys as these will be current for some time , but we have already dropped prices by an average of 20 percent for the jerseys of national teams that have dropped out of the competition , " lipsky told deutsche welle .
" the black away jerseys sold out quickly , and we 're still waiting to receive more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have dressed up to view the games the bonn branch sold more shirts for the 2010 world cup than for the 2008 european cup , in which the german team played – and lost – against spain in the final , according to lipsky .
" we did n't expect this demand , " he said .
" but when a team plays well , this is reflected in sales .
and the great weather has been a factor , too . "
for the big global and european soccer tournaments organized by soccer 's world-governing body fifa , adidas and other key suppliers like nike and puma urge retailers to place their orders well in advance and not to underestimate demand .
but because retailers typically worry about sitting on large inventories of unsold products , they often err on the side of caution – a practice that has boomeranged for many stores across the country .
sold out " we thought we ordered more than plenty of the jerseys , but they sold out really fast – a lot better than in 2006 , " mo rifi , a sales manager at sport-helmreich in duesseldorf , told deutsche welle .
" all of us are surprised .
we could have sold more . "
rifi says it will take until august to complete the backorders for the popular black jersey .
which all goes to show that if the german national team chooses a black jersey again , it 's better to strike before the team - and the weather - get too hot .

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .

but as a city with more hipsters per square mile than most , berlin has a rather diy approach to high-end fashion . i do n't consider myself to be a particularly fashionable person .
i do n't read all the glossy mags , i seldom visit flagship stores , and i certainly do n't talk down my nose to someone wearing something deemed " so last year . " i 'm quite happy to roll out of bed , pull on a tattered , crumpled t-shirt and a pair of yesterday 's socks and go to work . i suppose , thinking about it , by berlin standards i am quite fashionable in the sense that i wear what i want and do n't care a hoot about what anyone thinks . of course the common misconception is that the fashion business is a glitzy , glamorous affair but , like all misconceptions , this is a load of old rubbish and in berlin especially , with its low-budget do-it-yourself approach to everything , it is a particularly shabby affair . the grime behind the glitz i myself have done several photo shoots for glossy magazines and the thrill of being photographed evaporated almost the instant i was dressed like someone who had fallen out of the sky and landed in a jumble sale .
that pretty much sums up a photo shoot ; you arrive at silly o 'clock in the morning , are dressed like an extra from the star wars cantina and have to stand and stand and stand all day long in the most ridiculous poses .
and what do you get for your labors ?
fifty euros if you 're lucky and a crick in the neck . a mate of mine has been modeling part time for years and has done high profile shoots for heavyweights like gq , men 's health , vogue , etc .
combined income : around 340 euros .
he told me a particularly grim photo shoot story : " we shot in an empty apartment in february .
there was no heating , no coffee , nothing .
we were being photographed in vests and underwear .
of course we were freezing .
i remember the stylist putting make-up on my knees because they were turning blue .
i think they paid us an extra 30 euros sufferance money ! " so where 's the rosy warm glow of fame and fortune here , then ?
not exactly the sort of thing you can imagine naomi campbell or heidi klum having to put up with really , is it ? bildunterschrift : kraftwerk may well have sung about ' the model ' but is the industry really that glamorous ? just for the thrill of it another friend of mine is a photographer and has a wealth of similar horror stories .
his summary of working in the fashion business in berlin is that it is badly paid - " like every job here " - and is of the opinion that " we 're all more or less expected to do these jobs - photographers , stylists and models alike - for the thrill of it . " it seems the fashion business , like a lot of other jobs here in germany 's capital , has a large degree of play-acting attached to it .
it 's cheap to live here ; you do n't need a lot of money to survive , so why should you be paid a fair wage for doing a day 's work ?
surely , you should be grateful your face is going to be splashed on the pages of j 'n'c magazine ?
surely my landlords would be happier to get their rent this month , more like . the fact remains that for all its punky , streetwise trendiness , berlin just is n't a major player when it comes to high-end fashion .
even the annual fashion week is sponsored by mercedes-benz and you do n't need me to tell you that is a car company .
when was the last time you were at a party and heard , " oh , nice dress .
who is it ? " and the reply came , " well , actually it 's a mercedes-benz . " fashionably absent new york , london , milan ; these are the places where the hot shots hang out , do their stuff and , more importantly , make their money .
berlin is just a halfway house ; an exciting city with no real fashion industry - and , hence , no money - where all these bigwigs can assemble for a few days of getting drunk without actually having to prove anything .
and of course all the youngsters with very tentative links to a very shaky industry can wow all their friends with tales of who they met at these dazzlingly glamorous parties . as fashion week wraps up for another year , i myself wo n't shed a tear .
it does n't exactly have the wow factor among my circle of friends , fashion week being a bit akin to the annual christmas dinner for the cockles and winkles appreciation society ; it 's only really interesting if you 're in it . i did n't go to a single party , i did n't see a single runway show , i did n't meet a single up-and-coming new designer .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .
though the case has received widespread media coverage - with one of the spies , anna chapman , becoming a tabloid sensation due to nude photographs of the 28-year-old that have surfaced on the internet - the spy ring appears to have been amateurish and made little impact in the decade since being formed .
" no significant national security benefit would be gained from the prolonged incarceration in the united states of these 10 unlawful agents , " state department spokesman mark toner in response to the quick release .

a plane carrying the freed western spies has landed in washington .
nuclear expert included in russian pardon a spokesman for president dmitry medvedev confirmed late on thursday that the four russians would be pardoned , including arms control expert igor sutyagin .
a lawyer for sutyagin , who was sent to the frozen wastelands of arkhangelsk in northern russia after being convicted in 2004 , said her client was being flown to vienna .
also to be exchanged was sergei skripal , a former colonel with russian military intelligence sentenced in 2006 to 13 years jail on charges of spying for britain . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of spies from east and west were freed at glienicke the remaining two were alexander zaporozhsky , a former employee of the russian foreign intelligence service who was jailed for 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and a fourth man called gennadi vasilenko .
the exchange of captured agents between western and eastern powers was common practice during the cold war , with the swaps sometimes occurring on the glienicke bridge between east germany and west berlin .
the last high-profile swap took place in 1984 , when us journalist nicholas daniloff was expelled from russia the day before gennady zakharov , a soviet official at the united nations , was sent back to moscow after briefly appearing before a new york court .

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .
unfortunately , just as my book was going into print , two scandals relating to the ' egg and milk project ' hit the headlines in shanxi province , where hundreds of children became ill .
i am really losing hope for food safety in china . " food is the people 's heaven , a chinese saying goes .
but it seems this heaven has turned into hell for many chinese consumers . author : miao tian editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .
unfortunately , just as my book was going into print , two scandals relating to the ' egg and milk project ' hit the headlines in shanxi province , where hundreds of children became ill .
i am really losing hope for food safety in china . " food is the people 's heaven , a chinese saying goes .
but it seems this heaven has turned into hell for many chinese consumers . author : miao tian editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 09.07.2010 scars of srebrenica still visible 15 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this cemetary in srebrenica is a memorial to the massacre it 's been 15 years since the massacre of srebrenica left thousands of bosnian muslims dead .
the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .
though the case has received widespread media coverage - with one of the spies , anna chapman , becoming a tabloid sensation due to nude photographs of the 28-year-old that have surfaced on the internet - the spy ring appears to have been amateurish and made little impact in the decade since being formed .
" no significant national security benefit would be gained from the prolonged incarceration in the united states of these 10 unlawful agents , " state department spokesman mark toner in response to the quick release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secret agents are prohibited reentrance to the us in exchange for the agents , moscow agreed to release four russians detained in the country for spying for western countries .
a plane carrying the freed western spies has landed in washington .
nuclear expert included in russian pardon a spokesman for president dmitry medvedev confirmed late on thursday that the four russians would be pardoned , including arms control expert igor sutyagin .
a lawyer for sutyagin , who was sent to the frozen wastelands of arkhangelsk in northern russia after being convicted in 2004 , said her client was being flown to vienna .
also to be exchanged was sergei skripal , a former colonel with russian military intelligence sentenced in 2006 to 13 years jail on charges of spying for britain . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of spies from east and west were freed at glienicke the remaining two were alexander zaporozhsky , a former employee of the russian foreign intelligence service who was jailed for 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and a fourth man called gennadi vasilenko .
the exchange of captured agents between western and eastern powers was common practice during the cold war , with the swaps sometimes occurring on the glienicke bridge between east germany and west berlin .
the last high-profile swap took place in 1984 , when us journalist nicholas daniloff was expelled from russia the day before gennady zakharov , a soviet official at the united nations , was sent back to moscow after briefly appearing before a new york court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.07.2010 afghan mission sparks heated german parliamentary debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said that the afghanistan mission was necessary the german parliament marked its last day before the summer break on friday with a heated debate on nato 's afghanistan mission , as foreign minister guido westerwelle 's comments sparked outrage in the opposition . a promise from german foreign minister guido westerwelle , that planned cuts in the defense budget would not affect the military mission in afghanistan , sparked some outrage in the opposition during a stormy debate in the bundestag , germany 's parliament on friday .
but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 09.07.2010 in berlin , fashion is a shabby affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week sees the berlin glitterati in a fever as yet again the german capital hosts fashion week .
but as a city with more hipsters per square mile than most , berlin has a rather diy approach to high-end fashion . i do n't consider myself to be a particularly fashionable person .
i do n't read all the glossy mags , i seldom visit flagship stores , and i certainly do n't talk down my nose to someone wearing something deemed " so last year . " i 'm quite happy to roll out of bed , pull on a tattered , crumpled t-shirt and a pair of yesterday 's socks and go to work . i suppose , thinking about it , by berlin standards i am quite fashionable in the sense that i wear what i want and do n't care a hoot about what anyone thinks . of course the common misconception is that the fashion business is a glitzy , glamorous affair but , like all misconceptions , this is a load of old rubbish and in berlin especially , with its low-budget do-it-yourself approach to everything , it is a particularly shabby affair . the grime behind the glitz i myself have done several photo shoots for glossy magazines and the thrill of being photographed evaporated almost the instant i was dressed like someone who had fallen out of the sky and landed in a jumble sale .
that pretty much sums up a photo shoot ; you arrive at silly o 'clock in the morning , are dressed like an extra from the star wars cantina and have to stand and stand and stand all day long in the most ridiculous poses .
and what do you get for your labors ?
fifty euros if you 're lucky and a crick in the neck . a mate of mine has been modeling part time for years and has done high profile shoots for heavyweights like gq , men 's health , vogue , etc .
combined income : around 340 euros .
he told me a particularly grim photo shoot story : " we shot in an empty apartment in february .
there was no heating , no coffee , nothing .
we were being photographed in vests and underwear .
of course we were freezing .
i remember the stylist putting make-up on my knees because they were turning blue .
i think they paid us an extra 30 euros sufferance money ! " so where 's the rosy warm glow of fame and fortune here , then ?
not exactly the sort of thing you can imagine naomi campbell or heidi klum having to put up with really , is it ? bildunterschrift : kraftwerk may well have sung about ' the model ' but is the industry really that glamorous ? just for the thrill of it another friend of mine is a photographer and has a wealth of similar horror stories .
his summary of working in the fashion business in berlin is that it is badly paid - " like every job here " - and is of the opinion that " we 're all more or less expected to do these jobs - photographers , stylists and models alike - for the thrill of it . " it seems the fashion business , like a lot of other jobs here in germany 's capital , has a large degree of play-acting attached to it .
it 's cheap to live here ; you do n't need a lot of money to survive , so why should you be paid a fair wage for doing a day 's work ?
surely , you should be grateful your face is going to be splashed on the pages of j 'n'c magazine ?
surely my landlords would be happier to get their rent this month , more like . the fact remains that for all its punky , streetwise trendiness , berlin just is n't a major player when it comes to high-end fashion .
even the annual fashion week is sponsored by mercedes-benz and you do n't need me to tell you that is a car company .
when was the last time you were at a party and heard , " oh , nice dress .
who is it ? " and the reply came , " well , actually it 's a mercedes-benz . " fashionably absent new york , london , milan ; these are the places where the hot shots hang out , do their stuff and , more importantly , make their money .
berlin is just a halfway house ; an exciting city with no real fashion industry - and , hence , no money - where all these bigwigs can assemble for a few days of getting drunk without actually having to prove anything .
and of course all the youngsters with very tentative links to a very shaky industry can wow all their friends with tales of who they met at these dazzlingly glamorous parties . as fashion week wraps up for another year , i myself wo n't shed a tear .
it does n't exactly have the wow factor among my circle of friends , fashion week being a bit akin to the annual christmas dinner for the cockles and winkles appreciation society ; it 's only really interesting if you 're in it . i did n't go to a single party , i did n't see a single runway show , i did n't meet a single up-and-coming new designer .
and that , i suppose , is the really fashionable thing ; being invited to all of this stuff , and not bothering to turn up . neale lytollis was invited to appear in a runway show at this year ’ s fashion week but had to say no ; he was washing his hair . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 09.07.2010 opinion : no sign of a return to the cold war after spy swap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-russia spy affair does not signify a rift between the two countries .
on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "

like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .

this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.07.2010 german national team jerseys are a hot item in a hot summer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's performance has boosted jersey sales a young , captivating german soccer team competing in the world cup and a hot summer have been a huge boost for sportswear sales in germany .
the national black away jersey has sold out in much of the country . adidas , the official outfitter of the german national team and several others competing in the 2010 world cup , was expecting good sportswear sales in germany but had n't expected them to go quite as wild as they have .
numerous retailers across the country ran out of the official jerseys , particularly the elegant black away ones , just days into the global soccer event .
and that was despite the fact that adidas sold one million of the shirts to retailers worldwide ahead of the tournament , and has delivered an additional 200,000 since the kick-off in june .
' super satisfied ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black jersey of the german national team is sold out in 2006 , when the world cup was held in germany , adidas sold slightly more german jerseys worldwide - 1.5 million .
but this time round , it has done better overall .
figures for the sale of all adidas-sponsored squad shirts have more than doubled to reach a total of 6.5 million .
" we 're super satisfied with sales , " adidas spokeswoman kirsten keck , told deutsche welle .
adidas would probably be even happier if retailers had anticipated the booming demand for german national team jerseys and ordered more from the start , particularly given the none too flexible recommended retail price of 69.95 euros -lrb- $ 88.00 -rrb- .
the home and away sets of jerseys and shorts will be restocked and available until a new line of gear is introduced toward the end of next year , several months ahead of the upcoming european tournament , according to michael lipsky , store manager of the sportarena branch in bonn .
waiting for more " we wo n't reduce the price of the german national team jerseys as these will be current for some time , but we have already dropped prices by an average of 20 percent for the jerseys of national teams that have dropped out of the competition , " lipsky told deutsche welle .
" the black away jerseys sold out quickly , and we 're still waiting to receive more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have dressed up to view the games the bonn branch sold more shirts for the 2010 world cup than for the 2008 european cup , in which the german team played – and lost – against spain in the final , according to lipsky .
" we did n't expect this demand , " he said .
" but when a team plays well , this is reflected in sales .
and the great weather has been a factor , too . "
for the big global and european soccer tournaments organized by soccer 's world-governing body fifa , adidas and other key suppliers like nike and puma urge retailers to place their orders well in advance and not to underestimate demand .
but because retailers typically worry about sitting on large inventories of unsold products , they often err on the side of caution – a practice that has boomeranged for many stores across the country .
sold out " we thought we ordered more than plenty of the jerseys , but they sold out really fast – a lot better than in 2006 , " mo rifi , a sales manager at sport-helmreich in duesseldorf , told deutsche welle .
" all of us are surprised .
we could have sold more . "
rifi says it will take until august to complete the backorders for the popular black jersey .
which all goes to show that if the german national team chooses a black jersey again , it 's better to strike before the team - and the weather - get too hot .

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

european aerospace giant eads has confirmed it has made a bid for a massive us military contract for tanker refueling aircraft . european aerospace giant eads has confirmed it has made a bid for a massive us military contract for tanker refueling aircraft .
arch rival boeing is expected to submit its proposal on friday .
the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- bid to win the contract to build a new fleet of us air force aerial-refueling planes did not come as a surprise .
back in april , the pentagon announced it was willing to extend the bidding deadline to july 9 in order to allow the airbus parent company more time to consider submitting an offer .
eads north america chairman ralph crosby responded at the time by saying the deal , worth up to 39 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- , was a " hell of an opportunity " for the company .
an opportunity it has now seized .
speaking to reporters on thursday , crosby said the eads 8000-page proposal would prove its tanker 's " unequalled capabilities . "
he said his company was proud of its offering , which he described as " the only one in this competition that is flying and refueling today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refuelling in mid-flight a successful eads bid will see the european giant make a military version of the airbus a330 commercial passenger plane to replace the boeing-built fleet , now an average of 50 years-old .
stiff competition but airbus is not in the running alone for the construction of 179 aerial-refueling tankers .
boeing , which is the pentagon 's second largest supplier by sales , is expected to submit an offer based on its 767-passenger jet on friday .
earlier , us aerospace said it was also planning a last-minute bid in collaboration with russian-ukrainian manufacturer antonov .
but given the american company 's financial woes and the fact that antonov has yet to confirm its involvement in the project , there is some doubt about the seriousness of the unexpected announcement .
aviation expert cord schellenberg told deutsche welle that even if there is a third bid , he does n't see us aerospace as a serious contender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-subsidized : airbus a380 " this is a race between boeing and airbus , " he said , adding that although there was no clear favorite , there was a good chance that geography would play the deciding hand .
" the us administration has to decide whether they are willing to accept a european manufacturer or not , " schellenberg said , adding that american lobbyists were pushing very hard for home-designed and home-produced tankers .
born in the u.s.a. there has been much lament about the potential implications of the lucrative contract falling into european hands , and topping the list is the ever-present issue of americans losing jobs .
eads however , says that if it wins the bidding war , the aircraft would be assembled at a new facility in alabama , thereby creating jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing provides plenty of americans with jobs as strategic as such a pledge might be , schellenberg says its not enough for the military minds that want uncle sam 's stamp everywhere .
" they think they should buy american and not only aircraft produced in the us , " schellenberg said .
" they should by designed by and come from an american company as well . "
an eye for an eye transatlantic rivals , boeing and airbus have been locked in a bitter fight for the tanker deal since 2003 .
that year , the contract was awarded to boeing but the decision was overturned after the revelation of a conflict of interest .
then in 2008 , it went to airbus but was withdrawn again after the us government accountability office found the offers had been incorrectly analyzed .
with that kind of history , the two companies are watching each other with eagle eyes , waiting to trip one another up whenever the opportunity arises .
last week , the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- responded to a us complaint over subsidies to airbus , ruling that state support had helped airbus get its flagship a380 airborne .
in a tit-for-tat countersuit , the european union has the wto looking into allegations of improper us federal , state and local subsidies to boeing .
an interim report on the case had originally been expected by next week but an announcement on thursday put the date back to mid-september .
eads , the parent company of airbus , had been hoping that the report would deflect some of the negative attention focused on it after last week 's ruling , and the eu and airbus criticized the delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing and airbus : chalk and cheese " the time lag between this case and the united states ' case against support to airbus … has constantly increased over the six years this dispute has been running and the gap is now at nearly a year , " the eu 's executive commission said .
but ralph crosby rejected any talk of the subsidies in the context of the tanker deal .
" we are spending all our time on relatively arcane and inconsequential issues , " he told reporters , adding that the only real issue was how well the respective proposals meet the needs of the pentagon .
" it is the defense acquisition for the remainder of the century , " he said .
cord schellenberg agrees that it would make sense to forget geographical and political issues and to focus instead on business .
" the question is who is offering the better aircraft at the better price ? " he said .
" that is what the state should be looking for , especially as this is a tanker and not a war aircraft . "
the us air force is expected to announce its decision in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .
though the case has received widespread media coverage - with one of the spies , anna chapman , becoming a tabloid sensation due to nude photographs of the 28-year-old that have surfaced on the internet - the spy ring appears to have been amateurish and made little impact in the decade since being formed .
" no significant national security benefit would be gained from the prolonged incarceration in the united states of these 10 unlawful agents , " state department spokesman mark toner in response to the quick release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secret agents are prohibited reentrance to the us in exchange for the agents , moscow agreed to release four russians detained in the country for spying for western countries .
a plane carrying the freed western spies has landed in washington .
nuclear expert included in russian pardon a spokesman for president dmitry medvedev confirmed late on thursday that the four russians would be pardoned , including arms control expert igor sutyagin .
a lawyer for sutyagin , who was sent to the frozen wastelands of arkhangelsk in northern russia after being convicted in 2004 , said her client was being flown to vienna .
also to be exchanged was sergei skripal , a former colonel with russian military intelligence sentenced in 2006 to 13 years jail on charges of spying for britain . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of spies from east and west were freed at glienicke the remaining two were alexander zaporozhsky , a former employee of the russian foreign intelligence service who was jailed for 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and a fourth man called gennadi vasilenko .
the exchange of captured agents between western and eastern powers was common practice during the cold war , with the swaps sometimes occurring on the glienicke bridge between east germany and west berlin .
the last high-profile swap took place in 1984 , when us journalist nicholas daniloff was expelled from russia the day before gennady zakharov , a soviet official at the united nations , was sent back to moscow after briefly appearing before a new york court .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

it expired on june 30 . renewal had been in doubt following a row between google and the chinese authorities .
after complaining that its e-mail service had been hacked in china , google in january threatened to pull out of china completely and announced it would not continue censoring search results , as required under chinese regulations .
from march onwards , the company automatically redirected the users of its chinese page google.cn to the uncensored chinese-language google page based in hong kong -lrb- google.com.hk -rrb- .
google 's operations have faced other problems in china .
its video sharing platform youtube is banned there , for example .
but as china is a huge and rapidly growing internet market , google did n't want to be completely shut out from it either .
google 's compromise retaining an internet content provider 's licence in china therefore became crucial .
in the course of negotiations about the extension , google agreed to implement a compromise : visitors to google.cn are no longer automatically redirected to the hong kong page , but a link to google.com.hk is displayed in big letters immediately underneath the search window .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many websites are blocked by the government in china the whole fight is more about taking a stance than about making a real difference : chinese users will still have an incentive to use the uncensored hong kong-based search engine .
on the other hand , even search results that chinese users find via google hong kong are not accessible to them if the sites are blocked by the chinese authorities .
the links simply wo n't open .
facebook is a security threat : report meanwhile , a top chinese think tank has claimed that social networking sites like facebook pose a threat to national security .
in its annual report on the development of new media in china , the beijing-based chinese academy of social sciences -lrb- cass -rrb- said western countries including the us were using these websites to stir up political unrest in china .
the report mentioned - by way of example - last year 's rioting in the northwestern xinjiang region and claimed that overseas separatist groups had used facebook as a rallying point. tb / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it expired on june 30 . renewal had been in doubt following a row between google and the chinese authorities .
after complaining that its e-mail service had been hacked in china , google in january threatened to pull out of china completely and announced it would not continue censoring search results , as required under chinese regulations .
from march onwards , the company automatically redirected the users of its chinese page google.cn to the uncensored chinese-language google page based in hong kong -lrb- google.com.hk -rrb- .
google 's operations have faced other problems in china .
its video sharing platform youtube is banned there , for example .
but as china is a huge and rapidly growing internet market , google did n't want to be completely shut out from it either .
google 's compromise retaining an internet content provider 's licence in china therefore became crucial .
in the course of negotiations about the extension , google agreed to implement a compromise : visitors to google.cn are no longer automatically redirected to the hong kong page , but a link to google.com.hk is displayed in big letters immediately underneath the search window .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many websites are blocked by the government in china the whole fight is more about taking a stance than about making a real difference : chinese users will still have an incentive to use the uncensored hong kong-based search engine .
on the other hand , even search results that chinese users find via google hong kong are not accessible to them if the sites are blocked by the chinese authorities .
the links simply wo n't open .
facebook is a security threat : report meanwhile , a top chinese think tank has claimed that social networking sites like facebook pose a threat to national security .
in its annual report on the development of new media in china , the beijing-based chinese academy of social sciences -lrb- cass -rrb- said western countries including the us were using these websites to stir up political unrest in china .
the report mentioned - by way of example - last year 's rioting in the northwestern xinjiang region and claimed that overseas separatist groups had used facebook as a rallying point. tb / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "

at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 09.07.2010 women vanish from turkey 's working world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf hurts the chances of many job-seekers turkey prides itself on being a modern country with equal rights for women .
but when it comes to women in the workplace , there seems to be a problem .
a ban on headscarves may be part of it . according to world bank and oecd figures , fewer women work in turkey than in any other country from europe to central asia , including most muslim countries .
while women 's participation in the labor market has been rising steadily in other countries , it 's been falling in turkey for decades .
now the percentage of women in the turkish labor force is lower than in afghanistan and algeria .
only one in five turkish women work - down from one in three in the 1980s .
female university graduates and professional women have also withdrawn from the turkish labor market over the past couple of decades - a trend the world bank has dubbed " a puzzle . "
neslihan akbulut , a 27-year-old turkish sociologist , sees nothing puzzling about it .
akbulut graduated from university in sweden with a masters degree and returned to turkey to find a job .
" at first , i went after jobs that would match my qualifications , " akbulut said , " but of course no one would hire me .
then i applied for lesser positions in my field , then to lower jobs outside my field , even in a shop , but i was not hired . "
now she earns a nominal wage working as secretary for an ngo that defends the rights of women who wear headscarves - like her .
headscarf hurdle seventy percent of turkish women wear headscarves , making them ineligible for employment by the state .
headscarves were banned in all public offices and universities after the 1980 military coup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with an education , women looking for work in turkey have a tough time but women do n't fare much better in the private sector , according to dilek cindoglu , a professor of sociology at ankara 's bilkent university , who carried out the first scientific study of the problem .
" professional women in headscarves are discriminated against in the workplace , " cindoglu said .
" even a secretary in a small business must visit the public tax office occasionally or run errands to other government offices or to clients .
women in headscarves can not go to all these places .
so the public ban on headscarves definitely affects the private sector as well . "
this " spillover effect , " as she calls it , means that lawyers in headscarves can not enter a courtroom , and journalists in headscarves are barred from parliament .
cindoglu found obstacles to women in headscarves in almost every profession , albeit to varying degrees .
her findings echo nesluhan akbulut 's experience .
" companies worry about their image , " akbulut said .
" as a sociologist , i applied for a job as pollster in a polling company , but they told me they could n't afford to send out an interviewer in a headscarf - it would prejudice the interviewees . "
better chances abroad when professional women in headscarves are hired , they are often tucked away out of sight in back rooms and paid significantly less than men or bareheaded women , according to professor cindoglu 's findings .
that 's something akbulut is not prepared to accept any longer .
" i can not work in my profession here , " she said .
" at best i can continue to work as a secretary , but that is not how i want to live my life .
my husband and i have therefore decided to leave turkey and live abroad . "
akbulut wo n't be alone in leaving the country .
an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 young turkish women are currently studying at universities abroad because they are barred from entering universities in their own country .
given their lack of professional prospects in turkey , many never return .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 09.07.2010 scars of srebrenica still visible 15 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this cemetary in srebrenica is a memorial to the massacre it 's been 15 years since the massacre of srebrenica left thousands of bosnian muslims dead .
the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .

the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "

" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .

dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .

rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 09.07.2010 fashionistas wilt in sweltering berlin during fashion week großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new view , after nearly a month of shin guard-clad legs this season , berlin fashion week has to compete with the fifa world cup .
but as dw 's susan stone found out , there 's plenty of rivalry at the show , with guests scrambling for free stuff and designers vying for attention . berlin fashion week officially lasts 4 days , but it sometimes it feels like a month .
the fledgling event , which celebrates its third birthday this summer , is crammed full of on- and off-site runway shows , parties , presentations , trade shows , concerts , and - even models on bikes ! from internationally known names like boss black , calvin klein , and g-star to local favorites including kaviar gauche , esther perbant and lala berlin , there 's plenty to see . and there 's star watching too - celebrities including zoe saldana , diane kruger , milla jovovich , and boris becker are on hand for the festivities . but just because the guests look good does n't mean they 're all well behaved . unfortunately , pushing , shoving , and stepping on toes can happen to the best of us .
many designers kindly treat guests to a " goodie bag " or other gift - sometimes a notebook , sometimes a tote-bag , and on occasion truly odd or generous items like boxing gloves , a porcelain coffee cup , or silver jewelry . the swag is often confined to just the first row or two , leading to some bag-jacking .
last year at the show of one designer -lrb- who will remain nameless -rrb- , third row guests grabbed first-row gifts -lrb- a brand-name hair-styling appliance -rrb- and covertly shoved them into bags and under seats , sometimes nabbing two for themselves ! at least there 's plenty of free water , energy drinks , and beer to go around . bildunterschrift : models on bikes stage an impromptu fashion show for the label reality studio sweaty stilettos and smeared mascara with sweltering temperatures of 30 degrees celsius predicted for the end of the week , berlin starts to droop . " it 's not so good for photos , " confided one street style blogger , noting that sweaty fashionistas do n't make for the freshest of images . funnily enough , the official fashion week bag given to accredited journalists include a box of fabric underarm clothing protector shields - a decidedly unglamorous but practical addition to hairspray and a mini cocktail shaker . still , a few fashionistas managed to wear opaque black tights with their trendy clogs , long sleeve silk blouses and elegant trousers without passing out in the heat . bildunterschrift : the press was welcomed with useful perks - like underarm sweat protectors competition from the pitch as if an overbooked schedule and steamy weather was n't enough , the fifa world cup is also vying for our attentions , with the final and third place games taking place this weekend . trade show bread & butter is playing to the crowd , offering up an outdoor stadium-style grandstand for 3,000 viewers , complete with a 60-square-meter television screen , and - of course - lots of beer . the semi-final match between germany and spain took place on the opening night of fashion week .
it 's tempting to imagine a similar head to head from the catwalk - custo barcelona against boss black , perhaps ? designer guido maria kretschmer , whose label is appropriately based in muenster -lrb- germany -rrb- and mallorca -lrb- spain -rrb- , presented the perhaps presciently titled collection " dancing with myself " right before kick-off .
but german efficiency insured that the models left the catwalk before the players hit the field . off site , it was world cup versus the world of calvin klein , as guests at the designer 's perfectly produced party and presentation turned their backs on underwear models -lrb- some sans underwear -rrb- to watch the game . later , those rooting for the home team could drown their sorrows and party until dawn .
one berlin journalist remarked as the game ended , " now we can concentrate on fashion for the rest of the week ! " bildunterschrift : pitch or catwalk ?
for some , an easy choice author : susan stone editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

but as dw 's susan stone found out , there 's plenty of rivalry at the show , with guests scrambling for free stuff and designers vying for attention . berlin fashion week officially lasts 4 days , but it sometimes it feels like a month .
the fledgling event , which celebrates its third birthday this summer , is crammed full of on- and off-site runway shows , parties , presentations , trade shows , concerts , and - even models on bikes ! from internationally known names like boss black , calvin klein , and g-star to local favorites including kaviar gauche , esther perbant and lala berlin , there 's plenty to see . and there 's star watching too - celebrities including zoe saldana , diane kruger , milla jovovich , and boris becker are on hand for the festivities . but just because the guests look good does n't mean they 're all well behaved . unfortunately , pushing , shoving , and stepping on toes can happen to the best of us .
many designers kindly treat guests to a " goodie bag " or other gift - sometimes a notebook , sometimes a tote-bag , and on occasion truly odd or generous items like boxing gloves , a porcelain coffee cup , or silver jewelry . the swag is often confined to just the first row or two , leading to some bag-jacking .
last year at the show of one designer -lrb- who will remain nameless -rrb- , third row guests grabbed first-row gifts -lrb- a brand-name hair-styling appliance -rrb- and covertly shoved them into bags and under seats , sometimes nabbing two for themselves ! at least there 's plenty of free water , energy drinks , and beer to go around . bildunterschrift : models on bikes stage an impromptu fashion show for the label reality studio sweaty stilettos and smeared mascara with sweltering temperatures of 30 degrees celsius predicted for the end of the week , berlin starts to droop . " it 's not so good for photos , " confided one street style blogger , noting that sweaty fashionistas do n't make for the freshest of images . funnily enough , the official fashion week bag given to accredited journalists include a box of fabric underarm clothing protector shields - a decidedly unglamorous but practical addition to hairspray and a mini cocktail shaker . still , a few fashionistas managed to wear opaque black tights with their trendy clogs , long sleeve silk blouses and elegant trousers without passing out in the heat . bildunterschrift : the press was welcomed with useful perks - like underarm sweat protectors competition from the pitch as if an overbooked schedule and steamy weather was n't enough , the fifa world cup is also vying for our attentions , with the final and third place games taking place this weekend . trade show bread & butter is playing to the crowd , offering up an outdoor stadium-style grandstand for 3,000 viewers , complete with a 60-square-meter television screen , and - of course - lots of beer . the semi-final match between germany and spain took place on the opening night of fashion week .
it 's tempting to imagine a similar head to head from the catwalk - custo barcelona against boss black , perhaps ? designer guido maria kretschmer , whose label is appropriately based in muenster -lrb- germany -rrb- and mallorca -lrb- spain -rrb- , presented the perhaps presciently titled collection " dancing with myself " right before kick-off .
but german efficiency insured that the models left the catwalk before the players hit the field . off site , it was world cup versus the world of calvin klein , as guests at the designer 's perfectly produced party and presentation turned their backs on underwear models -lrb- some sans underwear -rrb- to watch the game . later , those rooting for the home team could drown their sorrows and party until dawn .
one berlin journalist remarked as the game ended , " now we can concentrate on fashion for the rest of the week ! " bildunterschrift : pitch or catwalk ?

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .
though the case has received widespread media coverage - with one of the spies , anna chapman , becoming a tabloid sensation due to nude photographs of the 28-year-old that have surfaced on the internet - the spy ring appears to have been amateurish and made little impact in the decade since being formed .
" no significant national security benefit would be gained from the prolonged incarceration in the united states of these 10 unlawful agents , " state department spokesman mark toner in response to the quick release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secret agents are prohibited reentrance to the us in exchange for the agents , moscow agreed to release four russians detained in the country for spying for western countries .
a plane carrying the freed western spies has landed in washington .
nuclear expert included in russian pardon a spokesman for president dmitry medvedev confirmed late on thursday that the four russians would be pardoned , including arms control expert igor sutyagin .
a lawyer for sutyagin , who was sent to the frozen wastelands of arkhangelsk in northern russia after being convicted in 2004 , said her client was being flown to vienna .
also to be exchanged was sergei skripal , a former colonel with russian military intelligence sentenced in 2006 to 13 years jail on charges of spying for britain . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of spies from east and west were freed at glienicke the remaining two were alexander zaporozhsky , a former employee of the russian foreign intelligence service who was jailed for 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and a fourth man called gennadi vasilenko .
the exchange of captured agents between western and eastern powers was common practice during the cold war , with the swaps sometimes occurring on the glienicke bridge between east germany and west berlin .
the last high-profile swap took place in 1984 , when us journalist nicholas daniloff was expelled from russia the day before gennady zakharov , a soviet official at the united nations , was sent back to moscow after briefly appearing before a new york court .

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .

they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european aerospace giant eads has confirmed it has made a bid for a massive us military contract for tanker refueling aircraft . european aerospace giant eads has confirmed it has made a bid for a massive us military contract for tanker refueling aircraft .
arch rival boeing is expected to submit its proposal on friday .
the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- bid to win the contract to build a new fleet of us air force aerial-refueling planes did not come as a surprise .
back in april , the pentagon announced it was willing to extend the bidding deadline to july 9 in order to allow the airbus parent company more time to consider submitting an offer .
eads north america chairman ralph crosby responded at the time by saying the deal , worth up to 39 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- , was a " hell of an opportunity " for the company .
an opportunity it has now seized .
speaking to reporters on thursday , crosby said the eads 8000-page proposal would prove its tanker 's " unequalled capabilities . "
he said his company was proud of its offering , which he described as " the only one in this competition that is flying and refueling today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refuelling in mid-flight a successful eads bid will see the european giant make a military version of the airbus a330 commercial passenger plane to replace the boeing-built fleet , now an average of 50 years-old .
stiff competition but airbus is not in the running alone for the construction of 179 aerial-refueling tankers .
boeing , which is the pentagon 's second largest supplier by sales , is expected to submit an offer based on its 767-passenger jet on friday .
earlier , us aerospace said it was also planning a last-minute bid in collaboration with russian-ukrainian manufacturer antonov .
but given the american company 's financial woes and the fact that antonov has yet to confirm its involvement in the project , there is some doubt about the seriousness of the unexpected announcement .
aviation expert cord schellenberg told deutsche welle that even if there is a third bid , he does n't see us aerospace as a serious contender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-subsidized : airbus a380 " this is a race between boeing and airbus , " he said , adding that although there was no clear favorite , there was a good chance that geography would play the deciding hand .
" the us administration has to decide whether they are willing to accept a european manufacturer or not , " schellenberg said , adding that american lobbyists were pushing very hard for home-designed and home-produced tankers .
born in the u.s.a. there has been much lament about the potential implications of the lucrative contract falling into european hands , and topping the list is the ever-present issue of americans losing jobs .
eads however , says that if it wins the bidding war , the aircraft would be assembled at a new facility in alabama , thereby creating jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing provides plenty of americans with jobs as strategic as such a pledge might be , schellenberg says its not enough for the military minds that want uncle sam 's stamp everywhere .
" they think they should buy american and not only aircraft produced in the us , " schellenberg said .
" they should by designed by and come from an american company as well . "
an eye for an eye transatlantic rivals , boeing and airbus have been locked in a bitter fight for the tanker deal since 2003 .
that year , the contract was awarded to boeing but the decision was overturned after the revelation of a conflict of interest .
then in 2008 , it went to airbus but was withdrawn again after the us government accountability office found the offers had been incorrectly analyzed .
with that kind of history , the two companies are watching each other with eagle eyes , waiting to trip one another up whenever the opportunity arises .
last week , the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- responded to a us complaint over subsidies to airbus , ruling that state support had helped airbus get its flagship a380 airborne .
in a tit-for-tat countersuit , the european union has the wto looking into allegations of improper us federal , state and local subsidies to boeing .
an interim report on the case had originally been expected by next week but an announcement on thursday put the date back to mid-september .
eads , the parent company of airbus , had been hoping that the report would deflect some of the negative attention focused on it after last week 's ruling , and the eu and airbus criticized the delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing and airbus : chalk and cheese " the time lag between this case and the united states ' case against support to airbus … has constantly increased over the six years this dispute has been running and the gap is now at nearly a year , " the eu 's executive commission said .
but ralph crosby rejected any talk of the subsidies in the context of the tanker deal .
" we are spending all our time on relatively arcane and inconsequential issues , " he told reporters , adding that the only real issue was how well the respective proposals meet the needs of the pentagon .
" it is the defense acquisition for the remainder of the century , " he said .
cord schellenberg agrees that it would make sense to forget geographical and political issues and to focus instead on business .
" the question is who is offering the better aircraft at the better price ? " he said .
" that is what the state should be looking for , especially as this is a tanker and not a war aircraft . "
the us air force is expected to announce its decision in november .

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.07.2010 german national team jerseys are a hot item in a hot summer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's performance has boosted jersey sales a young , captivating german soccer team competing in the world cup and a hot summer have been a huge boost for sportswear sales in germany .
the national black away jersey has sold out in much of the country . adidas , the official outfitter of the german national team and several others competing in the 2010 world cup , was expecting good sportswear sales in germany but had n't expected them to go quite as wild as they have .
numerous retailers across the country ran out of the official jerseys , particularly the elegant black away ones , just days into the global soccer event .
and that was despite the fact that adidas sold one million of the shirts to retailers worldwide ahead of the tournament , and has delivered an additional 200,000 since the kick-off in june .
' super satisfied ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black jersey of the german national team is sold out in 2006 , when the world cup was held in germany , adidas sold slightly more german jerseys worldwide - 1.5 million .
but this time round , it has done better overall .
figures for the sale of all adidas-sponsored squad shirts have more than doubled to reach a total of 6.5 million .
" we 're super satisfied with sales , " adidas spokeswoman kirsten keck , told deutsche welle .
adidas would probably be even happier if retailers had anticipated the booming demand for german national team jerseys and ordered more from the start , particularly given the none too flexible recommended retail price of 69.95 euros -lrb- $ 88.00 -rrb- .
the home and away sets of jerseys and shorts will be restocked and available until a new line of gear is introduced toward the end of next year , several months ahead of the upcoming european tournament , according to michael lipsky , store manager of the sportarena branch in bonn .
waiting for more " we wo n't reduce the price of the german national team jerseys as these will be current for some time , but we have already dropped prices by an average of 20 percent for the jerseys of national teams that have dropped out of the competition , " lipsky told deutsche welle .
" the black away jerseys sold out quickly , and we 're still waiting to receive more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have dressed up to view the games the bonn branch sold more shirts for the 2010 world cup than for the 2008 european cup , in which the german team played – and lost – against spain in the final , according to lipsky .
" we did n't expect this demand , " he said .
" but when a team plays well , this is reflected in sales .
and the great weather has been a factor , too . "
for the big global and european soccer tournaments organized by soccer 's world-governing body fifa , adidas and other key suppliers like nike and puma urge retailers to place their orders well in advance and not to underestimate demand .
but because retailers typically worry about sitting on large inventories of unsold products , they often err on the side of caution – a practice that has boomeranged for many stores across the country .
sold out " we thought we ordered more than plenty of the jerseys , but they sold out really fast – a lot better than in 2006 , " mo rifi , a sales manager at sport-helmreich in duesseldorf , told deutsche welle .
" all of us are surprised .
we could have sold more . "
rifi says it will take until august to complete the backorders for the popular black jersey .
which all goes to show that if the german national team chooses a black jersey again , it 's better to strike before the team - and the weather - get too hot .

the home and away sets of jerseys and shorts will be restocked and available until a new line of gear is introduced toward the end of next year , several months ahead of the upcoming european tournament , according to michael lipsky , store manager of the sportarena branch in bonn .
waiting for more " we wo n't reduce the price of the german national team jerseys as these will be current for some time , but we have already dropped prices by an average of 20 percent for the jerseys of national teams that have dropped out of the competition , " lipsky told deutsche welle .
" the black away jerseys sold out quickly , and we 're still waiting to receive more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have dressed up to view the games the bonn branch sold more shirts for the 2010 world cup than for the 2008 european cup , in which the german team played – and lost – against spain in the final , according to lipsky .
" we did n't expect this demand , " he said .
" but when a team plays well , this is reflected in sales .
and the great weather has been a factor , too . "
for the big global and european soccer tournaments organized by soccer 's world-governing body fifa , adidas and other key suppliers like nike and puma urge retailers to place their orders well in advance and not to underestimate demand .
but because retailers typically worry about sitting on large inventories of unsold products , they often err on the side of caution – a practice that has boomeranged for many stores across the country .
sold out " we thought we ordered more than plenty of the jerseys , but they sold out really fast – a lot better than in 2006 , " mo rifi , a sales manager at sport-helmreich in duesseldorf , told deutsche welle .
" all of us are surprised .
we could have sold more . "
rifi says it will take until august to complete the backorders for the popular black jersey .
which all goes to show that if the german national team chooses a black jersey again , it 's better to strike before the team - and the weather - get too hot .

paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 09.07.2010 opinion : no sign of a return to the cold war after spy swap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-russia spy affair does not signify a rift between the two countries .
on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.07.2010 conductor nagano 's decision to leave munich stirs up culture scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagano was apparently asked to say he would n't extend his contract munich 's cultural scene likes scandals .
and it is being turned into a scandal that music director kent nagano announced this week that he will not renew his contract with the bavarian state opera beyond 2013 . kent nagano 's decision may not come as a surprise , but the way it came about rocks the german cultural landscape , and the conductor 's temperately worded statement hints at the tensions between culture and politics that have been running high in the bavarian capital . " it 's not the fact that he is leaving , that upsets me , " opera critic klaus j. kalchschmid told deutsche welle , " but the fact that he was forced to do so by deliberate leaks to the press . " a few days earlier , bavaria 's sueddeutsche zeitung had suggested that nagano received a call from the bavarian secretary for science , research , and art wolfgang heubisch -lrb- a dentist by trade -rrb- , who allegedly told the music director that he would be at liberty to chose the moment when he would announce " his decision " not to renew his contract . no chance to save face the indiscretion meant , of course , that nagano was no longer at liberty to wait with the announcement - even if his departure had been an open secret .
if the operation was designed to let nagano save face and exit gracefully , it failed miserable thanks to the botched execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagano is credited with bringing new repertoire to munich 's main opera house musicologist , professor , and arts writer klaus peter richter deems the affair a tragedy of errors , dating back to earlier political appointments of the directorship of the bavarian state opera ; the crux lies in the relationship between the music director and the manager of the house , he said . manager nikolaus bachler , who declined to comment on nagano 's statement , did n't take up his position until the 2008/2009 season .
nagano had already been at his post for two seasons . " why the interim administration pushed for bachler , knowing full well that he and nagano would not get along , i do n't know , " grumbled richter .
" that was a mistake already . " citing bachler 's controversial brand of aesthetic decisions for the opera house , he said that having made the future of the bavarian opera an either-or situation where one of the two - bachler or nagano - would stay on , was yet another mistake .
he would n't mind seeing a fresh start on both positions . nagano not popular enough the only point that might not be controversial , meanwhile , is the actual departure of kent nagano .
the cosmopolitan californian 's cool and reserved style , musically and socially , never quite fit the munich scene and despite demonstrative applause and standing ovations at saturday 's performance of the mozart opera " don giovanni , " he was n't enthusiastically embraced by the audience and less so critics . klaus kalchschmid , who wrote about saturday 's " don giovanni " in the sueddeutsche zeitung that the overture was shapeless and that tension was lacking throughout , suggests that it 's no wonder that someone who messes mozart or tchaikovsky up every time he tries has a hard time establishing a broad fan base . for kalchschmid , it was one of the most mediocre performances of " don giovanni " he had ever heard .
still , the critic lamented that the press has yet to write a fair piece that assesses the weaknesses and strengths of both nagano and bachler . klaus peter richter sees the latter 's weaknesses in his desire to make opera interesting by adding ever more extra-musical stimuli , a strategy he said will necessary exhaust itself sooner or later .
others , like kalchschmid , are kinder on the controversial productions that bachler has brought to munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachler and nagano have n't made a great team , say critics nagano 's strength , meanwhile , was introducing the munich audiences to repertoire they had otherwise neglected - notably , operas by french composers francis poulenc , maurice ravel and olivier messiaen . better luck next time the upside to the behind-the-scenes operatic politicking is that arts secretary heubisch seems to know better than to try picking a music director himself and will let bachler make the choice this time . wolfram goertz from the german newspaper rheinische post is not the only one who suggests that nikolaus bachler will in that way get a candidate of his liking - most likely the young russian conductor kirill petrenko , who is the former music director of berlin 's comic opera . watching this style of running cultural institutions is little more pleasant than watching sausage being made - a fact that nagano hinted at in his statement this week when he took a dig at the incompetence of culture politics in munich . just earlier this year , the munich philharmonic and the city councilors drove conductor christian thielemann out of town .
ulrich peters , the manager of the smaller munich opera house , the gaertnerplatz theater , was also let go . kalchschmid and richter both shake their heads in embarrassment about this inadvertent musico-political theater , but at least munich gets to enjoy another little scandal . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .
unfortunately , just as my book was going into print , two scandals relating to the ' egg and milk project ' hit the headlines in shanxi province , where hundreds of children became ill .
i am really losing hope for food safety in china . " food is the people 's heaven , a chinese saying goes .
but it seems this heaven has turned into hell for many chinese consumers . author : miao tian editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .

can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .

i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .

the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.07.2010 afghan mission sparks heated german parliamentary debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said that the afghanistan mission was necessary the german parliament marked its last day before the summer break on friday with a heated debate on nato 's afghanistan mission , as foreign minister guido westerwelle 's comments sparked outrage in the opposition . a promise from german foreign minister guido westerwelle , that planned cuts in the defense budget would not affect the military mission in afghanistan , sparked some outrage in the opposition during a stormy debate in the bundestag , germany 's parliament on friday .
but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .
unfortunately , just as my book was going into print , two scandals relating to the ' egg and milk project ' hit the headlines in shanxi province , where hundreds of children became ill .
i am really losing hope for food safety in china . " food is the people 's heaven , a chinese saying goes .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

but when it comes to women in the workplace , there seems to be a problem .
a ban on headscarves may be part of it . according to world bank and oecd figures , fewer women work in turkey than in any other country from europe to central asia , including most muslim countries .
while women 's participation in the labor market has been rising steadily in other countries , it 's been falling in turkey for decades .
now the percentage of women in the turkish labor force is lower than in afghanistan and algeria .
only one in five turkish women work - down from one in three in the 1980s .
female university graduates and professional women have also withdrawn from the turkish labor market over the past couple of decades - a trend the world bank has dubbed " a puzzle . "
neslihan akbulut , a 27-year-old turkish sociologist , sees nothing puzzling about it .
akbulut graduated from university in sweden with a masters degree and returned to turkey to find a job .
" at first , i went after jobs that would match my qualifications , " akbulut said , " but of course no one would hire me .
then i applied for lesser positions in my field , then to lower jobs outside my field , even in a shop , but i was not hired . "
now she earns a nominal wage working as secretary for an ngo that defends the rights of women who wear headscarves - like her .
headscarf hurdle seventy percent of turkish women wear headscarves , making them ineligible for employment by the state .
headscarves were banned in all public offices and universities after the 1980 military coup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with an education , women looking for work in turkey have a tough time but women do n't fare much better in the private sector , according to dilek cindoglu , a professor of sociology at ankara 's bilkent university , who carried out the first scientific study of the problem .
" professional women in headscarves are discriminated against in the workplace , " cindoglu said .
" even a secretary in a small business must visit the public tax office occasionally or run errands to other government offices or to clients .
women in headscarves can not go to all these places .
so the public ban on headscarves definitely affects the private sector as well . "
this " spillover effect , " as she calls it , means that lawyers in headscarves can not enter a courtroom , and journalists in headscarves are barred from parliament .
cindoglu found obstacles to women in headscarves in almost every profession , albeit to varying degrees .
her findings echo nesluhan akbulut 's experience .
" companies worry about their image , " akbulut said .
" as a sociologist , i applied for a job as pollster in a polling company , but they told me they could n't afford to send out an interviewer in a headscarf - it would prejudice the interviewees . "
better chances abroad when professional women in headscarves are hired , they are often tucked away out of sight in back rooms and paid significantly less than men or bareheaded women , according to professor cindoglu 's findings .
that 's something akbulut is not prepared to accept any longer .
" i can not work in my profession here , " she said .
" at best i can continue to work as a secretary , but that is not how i want to live my life .
my husband and i have therefore decided to leave turkey and live abroad . "
akbulut wo n't be alone in leaving the country .
an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 young turkish women are currently studying at universities abroad because they are barred from entering universities in their own country .
given their lack of professional prospects in turkey , many never return .

but when it comes to women in the workplace , there seems to be a problem .
a ban on headscarves may be part of it . according to world bank and oecd figures , fewer women work in turkey than in any other country from europe to central asia , including most muslim countries .
while women 's participation in the labor market has been rising steadily in other countries , it 's been falling in turkey for decades .
now the percentage of women in the turkish labor force is lower than in afghanistan and algeria .
only one in five turkish women work - down from one in three in the 1980s .
female university graduates and professional women have also withdrawn from the turkish labor market over the past couple of decades - a trend the world bank has dubbed " a puzzle . "
neslihan akbulut , a 27-year-old turkish sociologist , sees nothing puzzling about it .
akbulut graduated from university in sweden with a masters degree and returned to turkey to find a job .
" at first , i went after jobs that would match my qualifications , " akbulut said , " but of course no one would hire me .
then i applied for lesser positions in my field , then to lower jobs outside my field , even in a shop , but i was not hired . "
now she earns a nominal wage working as secretary for an ngo that defends the rights of women who wear headscarves - like her .
headscarf hurdle seventy percent of turkish women wear headscarves , making them ineligible for employment by the state .
headscarves were banned in all public offices and universities after the 1980 military coup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with an education , women looking for work in turkey have a tough time but women do n't fare much better in the private sector , according to dilek cindoglu , a professor of sociology at ankara 's bilkent university , who carried out the first scientific study of the problem .
" professional women in headscarves are discriminated against in the workplace , " cindoglu said .
" even a secretary in a small business must visit the public tax office occasionally or run errands to other government offices or to clients .
women in headscarves can not go to all these places .
so the public ban on headscarves definitely affects the private sector as well . "
this " spillover effect , " as she calls it , means that lawyers in headscarves can not enter a courtroom , and journalists in headscarves are barred from parliament .
cindoglu found obstacles to women in headscarves in almost every profession , albeit to varying degrees .
her findings echo nesluhan akbulut 's experience .
" companies worry about their image , " akbulut said .
" as a sociologist , i applied for a job as pollster in a polling company , but they told me they could n't afford to send out an interviewer in a headscarf - it would prejudice the interviewees . "
better chances abroad when professional women in headscarves are hired , they are often tucked away out of sight in back rooms and paid significantly less than men or bareheaded women , according to professor cindoglu 's findings .
that 's something akbulut is not prepared to accept any longer .
" i can not work in my profession here , " she said .
" at best i can continue to work as a secretary , but that is not how i want to live my life .
my husband and i have therefore decided to leave turkey and live abroad . "
akbulut wo n't be alone in leaving the country .
an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 young turkish women are currently studying at universities abroad because they are barred from entering universities in their own country .
given their lack of professional prospects in turkey , many never return .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

he was praised for his " haunting illustration " of 20th century german history . the german academy for language and literature announced on friday that reinhard jirgl will be the recipient of this year 's georg buechner prize , germany 's highest literary honor .
the 57-year-old author , who from the age of 11 lived in then communist east berlin , will receive 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 51,000 -rrb- for the prize that has been awarded to a host of 20th century literary figures , including ingeborg bachmann and heinrich boell .
the academy for language and literature said in a statement that jirgl 's novelistic work was being recognized for its " epic breadth and perceptive illustration of the haunting , sometimes disturbingly suggestive panorama of 20th century german history . "
the statement added that jirgl 's novels offer an " everyday perspective " into the upheaval of postwar germany and make the " voices of the forgotten and the buried " once again audible , in particular in his two main works , " die unvollendeten " -lrb- " the unfinished " -rrb- and " die stille " -lrb- " calm " -rrb- .
the prize will be awarded to jirgl at a ceremony in october in darmstadt , where the german academy for language and literature is located .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .

european aerospace giant eads has confirmed it has made a bid for a massive us military contract for tanker refueling aircraft . european aerospace giant eads has confirmed it has made a bid for a massive us military contract for tanker refueling aircraft .
arch rival boeing is expected to submit its proposal on friday .
the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- bid to win the contract to build a new fleet of us air force aerial-refueling planes did not come as a surprise .
back in april , the pentagon announced it was willing to extend the bidding deadline to july 9 in order to allow the airbus parent company more time to consider submitting an offer .
eads north america chairman ralph crosby responded at the time by saying the deal , worth up to 39 billion euros -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- , was a " hell of an opportunity " for the company .
an opportunity it has now seized .
speaking to reporters on thursday , crosby said the eads 8000-page proposal would prove its tanker 's " unequalled capabilities . "
he said his company was proud of its offering , which he described as " the only one in this competition that is flying and refueling today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refuelling in mid-flight a successful eads bid will see the european giant make a military version of the airbus a330 commercial passenger plane to replace the boeing-built fleet , now an average of 50 years-old .
stiff competition but airbus is not in the running alone for the construction of 179 aerial-refueling tankers .
boeing , which is the pentagon 's second largest supplier by sales , is expected to submit an offer based on its 767-passenger jet on friday .
earlier , us aerospace said it was also planning a last-minute bid in collaboration with russian-ukrainian manufacturer antonov .
but given the american company 's financial woes and the fact that antonov has yet to confirm its involvement in the project , there is some doubt about the seriousness of the unexpected announcement .
aviation expert cord schellenberg told deutsche welle that even if there is a third bid , he does n't see us aerospace as a serious contender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-subsidized : airbus a380 " this is a race between boeing and airbus , " he said , adding that although there was no clear favorite , there was a good chance that geography would play the deciding hand .
" the us administration has to decide whether they are willing to accept a european manufacturer or not , " schellenberg said , adding that american lobbyists were pushing very hard for home-designed and home-produced tankers .
born in the u.s.a. there has been much lament about the potential implications of the lucrative contract falling into european hands , and topping the list is the ever-present issue of americans losing jobs .
eads however , says that if it wins the bidding war , the aircraft would be assembled at a new facility in alabama , thereby creating jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing provides plenty of americans with jobs as strategic as such a pledge might be , schellenberg says its not enough for the military minds that want uncle sam 's stamp everywhere .
" they think they should buy american and not only aircraft produced in the us , " schellenberg said .
" they should by designed by and come from an american company as well . "
an eye for an eye transatlantic rivals , boeing and airbus have been locked in a bitter fight for the tanker deal since 2003 .
that year , the contract was awarded to boeing but the decision was overturned after the revelation of a conflict of interest .
then in 2008 , it went to airbus but was withdrawn again after the us government accountability office found the offers had been incorrectly analyzed .
with that kind of history , the two companies are watching each other with eagle eyes , waiting to trip one another up whenever the opportunity arises .
last week , the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- responded to a us complaint over subsidies to airbus , ruling that state support had helped airbus get its flagship a380 airborne .
in a tit-for-tat countersuit , the european union has the wto looking into allegations of improper us federal , state and local subsidies to boeing .
an interim report on the case had originally been expected by next week but an announcement on thursday put the date back to mid-september .
eads , the parent company of airbus , had been hoping that the report would deflect some of the negative attention focused on it after last week 's ruling , and the eu and airbus criticized the delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing and airbus : chalk and cheese " the time lag between this case and the united states ' case against support to airbus … has constantly increased over the six years this dispute has been running and the gap is now at nearly a year , " the eu 's executive commission said .
but ralph crosby rejected any talk of the subsidies in the context of the tanker deal .
" we are spending all our time on relatively arcane and inconsequential issues , " he told reporters , adding that the only real issue was how well the respective proposals meet the needs of the pentagon .
" it is the defense acquisition for the remainder of the century , " he said .
cord schellenberg agrees that it would make sense to forget geographical and political issues and to focus instead on business .
" the question is who is offering the better aircraft at the better price ? " he said .
" that is what the state should be looking for , especially as this is a tanker and not a war aircraft . "
the us air force is expected to announce its decision in november .

authorities were following up on claims made by a former accountant of liliane bettencourt , the heiress to the l 'oreal empire , that the billionaire 's financial adviser gave 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- in cash to eric woerth , treasurer for the ump party and now also labor minister .
the limit for donations to political parties in france is 7,500 euros .
the cash was allegedly withdrawn at the request of patrice de maistre , bettencourt 's wealth manager , whose premises police searched friday .
" when you have an investigation of this size , several investigations , this type of search is not surprising , " de maistre 's lawyer , pascal wilhelm , told news agency reuters .
sarkozy has denied the claims that his party received secret cash from the 87-year-old bettencourt and said the reports were an effort to smear him .
allies of the embattled french president have also hit back , accusing elements of the country 's media of " fascist " tactics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .

there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 09.07.2010 afghan mission sparks heated german parliamentary debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said that the afghanistan mission was necessary the german parliament marked its last day before the summer break on friday with a heated debate on nato 's afghanistan mission , as foreign minister guido westerwelle 's comments sparked outrage in the opposition . a promise from german foreign minister guido westerwelle , that planned cuts in the defense budget would not affect the military mission in afghanistan , sparked some outrage in the opposition during a stormy debate in the bundestag , germany 's parliament on friday .
but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

his summary of working in the fashion business in berlin is that it is badly paid - " like every job here " - and is of the opinion that " we 're all more or less expected to do these jobs - photographers , stylists and models alike - for the thrill of it . " it seems the fashion business , like a lot of other jobs here in germany 's capital , has a large degree of play-acting attached to it .
it 's cheap to live here ; you do n't need a lot of money to survive , so why should you be paid a fair wage for doing a day 's work ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 09.07.2010 scars of srebrenica still visible 15 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this cemetary in srebrenica is a memorial to the massacre it 's been 15 years since the massacre of srebrenica left thousands of bosnian muslims dead .
the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

nancy greenleese got a taste of it , as she relays in this postcard from italy . i arrive in san giuseppe jato on a gorgeous afternoon .
the piazza is crowded with teenagers licking gelato cones .
older folks play cards outside coffee shops .
on the surface , life is beautiful .
but i 'm here to look beyond the sun-dappled scenery .
this is a stronghold of the mafia group called cosa nostra , or " our thing . "
and their " thing " is n't charity fundraisers .
it 's extortion , drug trafficking and prostitution .
one of the biggest names in the game hails from here - giovanni brusca , nicknamed the pig .
he has confessed to killing about 200 people , but admits he lost count at some point .
brusca is behind bars , but many of his followers are n't .
so , i 'm a little uncomfortable to begin with .
then i start to notice that people are staring at me .
but , i tell myself , it 's a small town and i 'm an outsider .
reliving ' the godfather ' i walk towards an intersection where a half-dozen signs point to nearby towns .
one is corleone - as in michael corleone , " the godfather . "
and , in the real world , it 's another town where the mafia rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corleone is one of the mafia 's strongholds in sicily i 'm feeling on edge .
but i 'm not going to give in to paranoia fueled by silly mob films .
i snap a few photos and head down the street .
but i do n't get far .
" signora !
signora ! " a young police officer calls out .
i freeze .
" why are you taking a picture ? " he asks sharply .
" the people leaving the station : you photographed them . "
i look around .
we are the only two people on the street .
i respond in italian . "
ma , scattava i cartelli stradali ! "
i 'm trying to say that i was photographing the street signs , but i botch it up , referring to myself in the third person like i was a professional athlete .
my fumbling foreigner acts fails to charm him . "

i put my passport in his palm and he directs me toward the station .
inside , he tells me to make myself comfortable .
uh , sure , i think .
i sit on the edge of the plastic chair .
" what are you doing here ? " he asks , quietly , calmly .
i tell him i 'm a reporter .
then i lie and say i 'm here for vacation .
his eyebrows raise .
he does n't believe me .
but i 'm not about to tell him i 'm here reporting on anti-mafia efforts .
the truth is : i do n't trust him .
this is italy .
this is sicily .
while there are many brave and honest police officers , the authorities and the mafia are often entangled .
one palm greases the other .
the locals are caught in the slime - extorted , contorted and wondering whom they can trust .
subtle threats while reporting here , i had met girolamo anselmo , one of many sicilians fighting back against the criminals .
he helps manage a farmer 's cooperative that 's cultivating land confiscated from his mafiosi neighbors .
the farmers are turning the soil from bad to good .
a vineyard and a hotel have already sprouted .
these are honest enterprises offering jobs in italy 's poorest province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy greenleese did not feel welcome in san giuseppe jato i asked anselmo if he 's ever scared .
he immediately says no .
but then admits he has worried about his family 's safety .
why ?
i ask .
well , there was that incident when mafiosi intimidated farm workers who were cultivating the seized land .
his coworkers mentioned the time when the mafia torched the fields .
yet no one woke up to find a horse 's head on their pillow .
the mafia is far more subtle , almost like a recurring nightmare .
they peddle in fear .
before leaving for sicily , friends in rome kept telling me to be careful . " stai attenta , " they said .
even when i asked for directions in sleepy san giuseppe jato , two shop owners repeated the mantra : " stai attenta . "
i 'm now very attentive as my passport number is being written down .
i show the officer my pictures - amateur shots of the street signs .
" signora , " he says , " i 'm so sorry for the mix-up . " he becomes super sweet , like one cannoli too many .
i feel slightly sick .
he 's done what he set out to do : scare me . i 'm not part of " their thing . "
i 'm not welcome .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 09.07.2010 us , russia seal cold war-like spy swap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cold war-style spy swap was apparently planned well ahead of arrests the us has returned 10 russian secret agents in exchange for four westerners held by the kremlin in what 's seen as the most sensational spy swap since the cold war . ten russian secret agents arrived back in moscow via the austrian capital vienna on friday after being deported from new york as part of a spy swap between the kremlin and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pictures of chapman have made their way through the net the agents pled guilty during a brief new york federal court session to acting as illegal agents for the russian government and were subsequently expelled from the united states .
though the case has received widespread media coverage - with one of the spies , anna chapman , becoming a tabloid sensation due to nude photographs of the 28-year-old that have surfaced on the internet - the spy ring appears to have been amateurish and made little impact in the decade since being formed .
" no significant national security benefit would be gained from the prolonged incarceration in the united states of these 10 unlawful agents , " state department spokesman mark toner in response to the quick release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secret agents are prohibited reentrance to the us in exchange for the agents , moscow agreed to release four russians detained in the country for spying for western countries .
a plane carrying the freed western spies has landed in washington .
nuclear expert included in russian pardon a spokesman for president dmitry medvedev confirmed late on thursday that the four russians would be pardoned , including arms control expert igor sutyagin .
a lawyer for sutyagin , who was sent to the frozen wastelands of arkhangelsk in northern russia after being convicted in 2004 , said her client was being flown to vienna .
also to be exchanged was sergei skripal , a former colonel with russian military intelligence sentenced in 2006 to 13 years jail on charges of spying for britain . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of spies from east and west were freed at glienicke the remaining two were alexander zaporozhsky , a former employee of the russian foreign intelligence service who was jailed for 18 years for espionage in 2003 , and a fourth man called gennadi vasilenko .
the exchange of captured agents between western and eastern powers was common practice during the cold war , with the swaps sometimes occurring on the glienicke bridge between east germany and west berlin .
the last high-profile swap took place in 1984 , when us journalist nicholas daniloff was expelled from russia the day before gennady zakharov , a soviet official at the united nations , was sent back to moscow after briefly appearing before a new york court .

dw-world.de opinion : no sign of a return to the cold war after spy swap the us-russia spy affair does not signify a rift between the two countries .
on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

one player in particular will step off the plane in montevideo with his reputation dramatically enhanced : diego forlan .
forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

forlan is more than uruguay 's playmaker , stand-in captain and best player .
he is their talisman .
it may be a matter for debate but it could be argued that it was forlan alone who inspired uruguay to performances at the world cup that other small nations could only dream of .
while other more celebrated stars were wilting under the pressure in between bouts of complaining of tiredness after a long season , forlan showed that even with 67 games under his belt he still had the will and desire to lead one of the unfancied teams at the tournament to heights rarely scaled since the days of uruguay 's 1950 world cup win .
bildunterschrift : forlan 's goals from distance show he is one of the few stars who 've been able to master the jubalani playing off main striker luis suarez in his favored position between midfield and attack , forlan has shown throughout the tournament that he values every moment he is given playing in the shirt of la celeste .
at 31 , his chances to win something with his nation are certainly running out and the almost desperate way he applies himself in every game suggests he is battling the passage of time itself .
his three ' man of the match ' performances are testament to his dedication to the cause .
while his exploits in south africa will have added to his growing status as one of the best attackers in the world , the experience of having superlatives hurled at him is not a new one for diego forlan .
but it was n't always like this .
the striker has known as many bad times as good and as such is unlikely to allow the latest round of praise and attention go to his head .
from figure of fun to world class striker in the light of his recent successes in club football , it may be difficult to imagine forlan as a figure of fun but before his career took off , the uruguayan very nearly sunk without trace before it even began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's terrible form earned him the name diego forlorn after following in his grandfather 's shoes by playing for independiente in argentina , the then 23-year old forlan moved to the english premiership in 2002 , signing for manchester united in an 8.2 million euro -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- deal .
the form which prompted sir alex ferguson to bring forlan to old trafford , however , deserted him on arrival .
it took him eight months and 27 games to score his first goal and his woeful return led to sections of the british press dubbing him " diego forlorn . "
despite winning the english title with man united in the 2002/03 season , forlan was sold to villareal in 2004 with his reputation in tatters .
he was seen as a joke , a failure .
however , an amazing rehabilitation took place during his first season in spain .
forlan ended the campaign as the top scorer in la liga and shared the 2004/5 european golden boot award with thierry henry .
forlan 's form also led the yellow submarine into the champions league for the first time in their history .
forlan hits the heights with atletico madrid forlan moved on to atletico madrid in 2007 to fill the striking vacancy created by local hero fernando torres 's departure to liverpool .
the uruguayan proved to be an inspired signing and in the 2008/09 season , he was once again the top scorer in spain with 32 goals in 33 matches , as well as winning the european golden boot for a second time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's two goals won the europa league final for atletico forlan has gone from strength to strength at atletico and was an integral part of the team that won last season 's europa league title , scoring both of madrid 's goals in the 2-1 defeat of fulham in the final .
this has certainly been forlan 's best year of his career , leading his club to european glory and his country to the last four of the world cup .
he now has the job of leading uruguay to a potential third place finish in south africa with victory over germany in port elizabeth - if he can shake off the thigh injury which led to him being substituted in the semi-final against the dutch .
goal scoring exploits put diego in the shop window it 's even possible that he could finish the tournament with another accolade if he can add to his world cup tally against the germans .
forlan currently has four goals , equal to germany 's miroslav klose who he will face on saturday , and has maintained during the tournament his scoring average of a goal in every 2.5 games for uruguay .
his other main rivals , five-goal stars wesley sneijder of the netherlands and spain 's david villa , meet in the final on sunday .
bildunterschrift : europe 's top clubs will be looking to poach forlan but the striker says he 's happy at atletico madrid it 's unsurprising given the impact he has had in south africa that suitors will soon come calling for his services .
tottenham hotspur and even his old club manchester united are rumored to be interested in bringing him back to england from spain but forlan has said that he is committed to atletico madrid .
anyone witnessing forlan 's commitment at the world cup will know that this means the uruguayan star is going nowhere .

in the finals , paul went with spain , which he picked to beat germany in the semis . after breaking the hearts of german fans by prophesying spain 's victory over germany in the semifinals , paul has made an attempt at reconciliation by picking germany to win saturday 's consolation match against uruguay .
the octopus , who has become a world cup sensation by correctly predicting all six germany games , plumped for the scallop in the container bearing the german flag on friday , without considering even for a second the food in the uruguayan box .
german fans , however , stung by paul 's treachery , have yet to forgive him and would apparently prefer him as sushi .
his aquarium in oberhausen has received death-threat emails saying : " we want paul for the pan . "
after picking germany , the two-year-old oracle then took a rest before predicting the result of the final between spain and the netherlands , opting for a red and yellow fiesta over the dutch oranje .
in response to the threats on paul 's life , meanwhile , spanish industry minister miguel sebastian has called for the creature to be given an " immediate " free transfer to spain to " ensure his protection . "

but when it comes to women in the workplace , there seems to be a problem .
a ban on headscarves may be part of it . according to world bank and oecd figures , fewer women work in turkey than in any other country from europe to central asia , including most muslim countries .
while women 's participation in the labor market has been rising steadily in other countries , it 's been falling in turkey for decades .
now the percentage of women in the turkish labor force is lower than in afghanistan and algeria .
only one in five turkish women work - down from one in three in the 1980s .
female university graduates and professional women have also withdrawn from the turkish labor market over the past couple of decades - a trend the world bank has dubbed " a puzzle . "
neslihan akbulut , a 27-year-old turkish sociologist , sees nothing puzzling about it .
akbulut graduated from university in sweden with a masters degree and returned to turkey to find a job .
" at first , i went after jobs that would match my qualifications , " akbulut said , " but of course no one would hire me .
then i applied for lesser positions in my field , then to lower jobs outside my field , even in a shop , but i was not hired . "
now she earns a nominal wage working as secretary for an ngo that defends the rights of women who wear headscarves - like her .
headscarf hurdle seventy percent of turkish women wear headscarves , making them ineligible for employment by the state .
headscarves were banned in all public offices and universities after the 1980 military coup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with an education , women looking for work in turkey have a tough time but women do n't fare much better in the private sector , according to dilek cindoglu , a professor of sociology at ankara 's bilkent university , who carried out the first scientific study of the problem .
" professional women in headscarves are discriminated against in the workplace , " cindoglu said .
" even a secretary in a small business must visit the public tax office occasionally or run errands to other government offices or to clients .
women in headscarves can not go to all these places .
so the public ban on headscarves definitely affects the private sector as well . "
this " spillover effect , " as she calls it , means that lawyers in headscarves can not enter a courtroom , and journalists in headscarves are barred from parliament .
cindoglu found obstacles to women in headscarves in almost every profession , albeit to varying degrees .
her findings echo nesluhan akbulut 's experience .
" companies worry about their image , " akbulut said .
" as a sociologist , i applied for a job as pollster in a polling company , but they told me they could n't afford to send out an interviewer in a headscarf - it would prejudice the interviewees . "
better chances abroad when professional women in headscarves are hired , they are often tucked away out of sight in back rooms and paid significantly less than men or bareheaded women , according to professor cindoglu 's findings .
that 's something akbulut is not prepared to accept any longer .
" i can not work in my profession here , " she said .
" at best i can continue to work as a secretary , but that is not how i want to live my life .
my husband and i have therefore decided to leave turkey and live abroad . "
akbulut wo n't be alone in leaving the country .
an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 young turkish women are currently studying at universities abroad because they are barred from entering universities in their own country .
given their lack of professional prospects in turkey , many never return .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .

but as a city with more hipsters per square mile than most , berlin has a rather diy approach to high-end fashion . i do n't consider myself to be a particularly fashionable person .
i do n't read all the glossy mags , i seldom visit flagship stores , and i certainly do n't talk down my nose to someone wearing something deemed " so last year . " i 'm quite happy to roll out of bed , pull on a tattered , crumpled t-shirt and a pair of yesterday 's socks and go to work . i suppose , thinking about it , by berlin standards i am quite fashionable in the sense that i wear what i want and do n't care a hoot about what anyone thinks . of course the common misconception is that the fashion business is a glitzy , glamorous affair but , like all misconceptions , this is a load of old rubbish and in berlin especially , with its low-budget do-it-yourself approach to everything , it is a particularly shabby affair . the grime behind the glitz i myself have done several photo shoots for glossy magazines and the thrill of being photographed evaporated almost the instant i was dressed like someone who had fallen out of the sky and landed in a jumble sale .
that pretty much sums up a photo shoot ; you arrive at silly o 'clock in the morning , are dressed like an extra from the star wars cantina and have to stand and stand and stand all day long in the most ridiculous poses .
and what do you get for your labors ?
fifty euros if you 're lucky and a crick in the neck . a mate of mine has been modeling part time for years and has done high profile shoots for heavyweights like gq , men 's health , vogue , etc .
combined income : around 340 euros .
he told me a particularly grim photo shoot story : " we shot in an empty apartment in february .
there was no heating , no coffee , nothing .
we were being photographed in vests and underwear .
of course we were freezing .
i remember the stylist putting make-up on my knees because they were turning blue .
i think they paid us an extra 30 euros sufferance money ! " so where 's the rosy warm glow of fame and fortune here , then ?
not exactly the sort of thing you can imagine naomi campbell or heidi klum having to put up with really , is it ? bildunterschrift : kraftwerk may well have sung about ' the model ' but is the industry really that glamorous ? just for the thrill of it another friend of mine is a photographer and has a wealth of similar horror stories .
his summary of working in the fashion business in berlin is that it is badly paid - " like every job here " - and is of the opinion that " we 're all more or less expected to do these jobs - photographers , stylists and models alike - for the thrill of it . " it seems the fashion business , like a lot of other jobs here in germany 's capital , has a large degree of play-acting attached to it .
it 's cheap to live here ; you do n't need a lot of money to survive , so why should you be paid a fair wage for doing a day 's work ?
surely , you should be grateful your face is going to be splashed on the pages of j 'n'c magazine ?
surely my landlords would be happier to get their rent this month , more like . the fact remains that for all its punky , streetwise trendiness , berlin just is n't a major player when it comes to high-end fashion .
even the annual fashion week is sponsored by mercedes-benz and you do n't need me to tell you that is a car company .
when was the last time you were at a party and heard , " oh , nice dress .
who is it ? " and the reply came , " well , actually it 's a mercedes-benz . " fashionably absent new york , london , milan ; these are the places where the hot shots hang out , do their stuff and , more importantly , make their money .
berlin is just a halfway house ; an exciting city with no real fashion industry - and , hence , no money - where all these bigwigs can assemble for a few days of getting drunk without actually having to prove anything .
and of course all the youngsters with very tentative links to a very shaky industry can wow all their friends with tales of who they met at these dazzlingly glamorous parties . as fashion week wraps up for another year , i myself wo n't shed a tear .
it does n't exactly have the wow factor among my circle of friends , fashion week being a bit akin to the annual christmas dinner for the cockles and winkles appreciation society ; it 's only really interesting if you 're in it . i did n't go to a single party , i did n't see a single runway show , i did n't meet a single up-and-coming new designer .
and that , i suppose , is the really fashionable thing ; being invited to all of this stuff , and not bothering to turn up . gavin blackburn was invited to appear in a runway show at this year ’ s fashion week but had to say no ; he was washing his hair . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

authorities were following up on claims made by a former accountant of liliane bettencourt , the heiress to the l 'oreal empire , that the billionaire 's financial adviser gave 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- in cash to eric woerth , treasurer for the ump party and now also labor minister .
the limit for donations to political parties in france is 7,500 euros .
the cash was allegedly withdrawn at the request of patrice de maistre , bettencourt 's wealth manager , whose premises police searched friday .
" when you have an investigation of this size , several investigations , this type of search is not surprising , " de maistre 's lawyer , pascal wilhelm , told news agency reuters .
sarkozy has denied the claims that his party received secret cash from the 87-year-old bettencourt and said the reports were an effort to smear him .
allies of the embattled french president have also hit back , accusing elements of the country 's media of " fascist " tactics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 09.07.2010 in berlin , fashion is a shabby affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week sees the berlin glitterati in a fever as yet again the german capital hosts fashion week .
but as a city with more hipsters per square mile than most , berlin has a rather diy approach to high-end fashion . i do n't consider myself to be a particularly fashionable person .
i do n't read all the glossy mags , i seldom visit flagship stores , and i certainly do n't talk down my nose to someone wearing something deemed " so last year . " i 'm quite happy to roll out of bed , pull on a tattered , crumpled t-shirt and a pair of yesterday 's socks and go to work . i suppose , thinking about it , by berlin standards i am quite fashionable in the sense that i wear what i want and do n't care a hoot about what anyone thinks . of course the common misconception is that the fashion business is a glitzy , glamorous affair but , like all misconceptions , this is a load of old rubbish and in berlin especially , with its low-budget do-it-yourself approach to everything , it is a particularly shabby affair . the grime behind the glitz i myself have done several photo shoots for glossy magazines and the thrill of being photographed evaporated almost the instant i was dressed like someone who had fallen out of the sky and landed in a jumble sale .
that pretty much sums up a photo shoot ; you arrive at silly o 'clock in the morning , are dressed like an extra from the star wars cantina and have to stand and stand and stand all day long in the most ridiculous poses .
and what do you get for your labors ?
fifty euros if you 're lucky and a crick in the neck . a mate of mine has been modeling part time for years and has done high profile shoots for heavyweights like gq , men 's health , vogue , etc .
combined income : around 340 euros .
he told me a particularly grim photo shoot story : " we shot in an empty apartment in february .
there was no heating , no coffee , nothing .
we were being photographed in vests and underwear .
of course we were freezing .
i remember the stylist putting make-up on my knees because they were turning blue .
i think they paid us an extra 30 euros sufferance money ! " so where 's the rosy warm glow of fame and fortune here , then ?
not exactly the sort of thing you can imagine naomi campbell or heidi klum having to put up with really , is it ? bildunterschrift : kraftwerk may well have sung about ' the model ' but is the industry really that glamorous ? just for the thrill of it another friend of mine is a photographer and has a wealth of similar horror stories .
his summary of working in the fashion business in berlin is that it is badly paid - " like every job here " - and is of the opinion that " we 're all more or less expected to do these jobs - photographers , stylists and models alike - for the thrill of it . " it seems the fashion business , like a lot of other jobs here in germany 's capital , has a large degree of play-acting attached to it .
it 's cheap to live here ; you do n't need a lot of money to survive , so why should you be paid a fair wage for doing a day 's work ?
surely , you should be grateful your face is going to be splashed on the pages of j 'n'c magazine ?
surely my landlords would be happier to get their rent this month , more like . the fact remains that for all its punky , streetwise trendiness , berlin just is n't a major player when it comes to high-end fashion .
even the annual fashion week is sponsored by mercedes-benz and you do n't need me to tell you that is a car company .
when was the last time you were at a party and heard , " oh , nice dress .
who is it ? " and the reply came , " well , actually it 's a mercedes-benz . " fashionably absent new york , london , milan ; these are the places where the hot shots hang out , do their stuff and , more importantly , make their money .
berlin is just a halfway house ; an exciting city with no real fashion industry - and , hence , no money - where all these bigwigs can assemble for a few days of getting drunk without actually having to prove anything .
and of course all the youngsters with very tentative links to a very shaky industry can wow all their friends with tales of who they met at these dazzlingly glamorous parties . as fashion week wraps up for another year , i myself wo n't shed a tear .
it does n't exactly have the wow factor among my circle of friends , fashion week being a bit akin to the annual christmas dinner for the cockles and winkles appreciation society ; it 's only really interesting if you 're in it . i did n't go to a single party , i did n't see a single runway show , i did n't meet a single up-and-coming new designer .
and that , i suppose , is the really fashionable thing ; being invited to all of this stuff , and not bothering to turn up . neale lytollis was invited to appear in a runway show at this year ’ s fashion week but had to say no ; he was washing his hair . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .

even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .

finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .
but medvedev is bound to have understood this latest signal coming from washington and it is a good basis for a further strengthening of us-russian relations in that vein .

for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 09.07.2010 scars of srebrenica still visible 15 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this cemetary in srebrenica is a memorial to the massacre it 's been 15 years since the massacre of srebrenica left thousands of bosnian muslims dead .
the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

the people on both sides of that conflict are slowly finding common ground now , but the tragedy is never far from their minds . the cimos factory on the outskirts of srebrenica is alive with the sound of its vast machinery whirring into action .
emulsifying fluid spews out of various contraptions ; soldered metal produces an acrid smell that pervades the space .
this is where material is produced to be made into car parts that will be sold to firms like renault or toyota .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cimos factory has brought bosnian muslims and serbs together but the factory is known for something more unusual .
it is the biggest mixed employer in the area : of its 100 workers , 77 are bosnian muslim and the rest bosnian serbs .
just 15 years have passed since these two communities - as well as the bosnian croats - fought each other in a devastating civil war that killed 100,000 people .
and 15 years have passed since srebrenica itself saw the brutal culmination of that war .
this eastern town , in the heart of serb-held territory , had been declared a united nations ' safe zone , ' to which thousands of muslims fled during the war .
but the small dutch un force protecting the area proved little match for the bosnian serb army , which besieged srebrenica , separating out the population .
the women were loaded onto buses to be led to safety , while the men and boys were taken off to be shot , with others murdered as they tried to flee into the forests .
the un says over 7,000 were killed over five days in july 1995 .
it was europe 's worst act of mass murder since world war ii .
employment aids reconciliation bringing the two communities together - serb and muslim - in a working environment has taken time and is still on a limited scale .
but there are signs that providing employment aids reconciliation .
" they all get on well here , " says azem huremovic , the factory director .
" they 're delighted to have jobs .
it 's those who have nothing to do during their days who dwell on the past . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jasarevic lost her father and brother in 1995 almedina jasarevic , a 23-year-old muslim employee seems , at first , to agree .
" the serbs are here to make money , just like me , " she told deutsche welle .
" i have no problem with them . "
but then she speaks about her father and brother who were lost during the massacre .
the tears come as she recalls how only some of her father 's remains have been found .
" they talk and laugh with you as if nothing happened , " she said .
" they know what they did .
they 're not ashamed of it - and they should be . "
but that 's a view rejected by many serbs here .
they feel unfairly demonized by the west and do n't believe the international organizations that continue to identify victims found in mass graves through dna analysis .
mladen grujicic works for an association helping the families of serb victims from the war , which he says have been forgotten .
" the serb people are portrayed in the media as committing genocide , but it is n't so , " he said in his tiny office in the center of town .
" i do n't believe that 7,000 or 8,000 people were killed because the muslims themselves do n't agree .
no serbs contest that a crime was committed in srebrenica , but we 're offended when from four you make eight , or from three you make six , " he says .
ongoing segregation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visible evidence of the war makes it hard to forget it is entrenched positions and separate truths that have fuelled the ongoing segregation here , exacerbated by chronic unemployment .
and with many of the buildings in town still riddled with bullet holes , it is hard to escape the painful memories .
but for one returnee , the fact of coming back has helped him to move on .
rob zomer is a former dutch soldier who was stationed with the un force in srebrenica in 1995 .
dutch soldiers were widely blamed for failing to stop the killings ; the entire dutch government resigned in 2002 after an independent report criticized both the un and the netherlands for their mistakes in srebrenica .
but 15 years on , zomer has decided to return , building a family home in the surrounding mountains .
" i have history here - bad or good , " he said as we surveyed the construction site .
" but that 's not why i came back .
i came for mountains , forests and no stress .
some people ask whether i returned because of guilt , " he added .
" absolutely not .
we did more than we could for the people here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former dutch soldier rob zomer has found his peace in srebrenica zomer recalls how he suffered from post-traumatic stress after leaving srebrenica - and how coming back has helped ease that .
" when you come here and local people say , ' thank you that you tried to protect my family in ' 95 , ' that 's a good feeling , " he said .
everyone here has their way of trying to lay the past to rest - but it 's hard to see how this still unhappy town can truly move on .
srebrenica - it means ' silver town ' after the silver and zinc mines the area boasted years ago .
it is an evocative , romantic name .
but since 1995 the glint has been dulled .
and maybe it will never shine again .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

it expired on june 30 . renewal had been in doubt following a row between google and the chinese authorities .
after complaining that its e-mail service had been hacked in china , google in january threatened to pull out of china completely and announced it would not continue censoring search results , as required under chinese regulations .
from march onwards , the company automatically redirected the users of its chinese page google.cn to the uncensored chinese-language google page based in hong kong -lrb- google.com.hk -rrb- .
google 's operations have faced other problems in china .
its video sharing platform youtube is banned there , for example .
but as china is a huge and rapidly growing internet market , google did n't want to be completely shut out from it either .
google 's compromise retaining an internet content provider 's licence in china therefore became crucial .
in the course of negotiations about the extension , google agreed to implement a compromise : visitors to google.cn are no longer automatically redirected to the hong kong page , but a link to google.com.hk is displayed in big letters immediately underneath the search window .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many websites are blocked by the government in china the whole fight is more about taking a stance than about making a real difference : chinese users will still have an incentive to use the uncensored hong kong-based search engine .
on the other hand , even search results that chinese users find via google hong kong are not accessible to them if the sites are blocked by the chinese authorities .
the links simply wo n't open .
facebook is a security threat : report meanwhile , a top chinese think tank has claimed that social networking sites like facebook pose a threat to national security .
in its annual report on the development of new media in china , the beijing-based chinese academy of social sciences -lrb- cass -rrb- said western countries including the us were using these websites to stir up political unrest in china .
the report mentioned - by way of example - last year 's rioting in the northwestern xinjiang region and claimed that overseas separatist groups had used facebook as a rallying point. tb / afp / ap / dpa / reuters editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "

at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .

in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .
unfortunately , just as my book was going into print , two scandals relating to the ' egg and milk project ' hit the headlines in shanxi province , where hundreds of children became ill .
i am really losing hope for food safety in china . " food is the people 's heaven , a chinese saying goes .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .

still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.07.2010 german national team jerseys are a hot item in a hot summer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's performance has boosted jersey sales a young , captivating german soccer team competing in the world cup and a hot summer have been a huge boost for sportswear sales in germany .
the national black away jersey has sold out in much of the country . adidas , the official outfitter of the german national team and several others competing in the 2010 world cup , was expecting good sportswear sales in germany but had n't expected them to go quite as wild as they have .
numerous retailers across the country ran out of the official jerseys , particularly the elegant black away ones , just days into the global soccer event .
and that was despite the fact that adidas sold one million of the shirts to retailers worldwide ahead of the tournament , and has delivered an additional 200,000 since the kick-off in june .
' super satisfied ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black jersey of the german national team is sold out in 2006 , when the world cup was held in germany , adidas sold slightly more german jerseys worldwide - 1.5 million .
but this time round , it has done better overall .
figures for the sale of all adidas-sponsored squad shirts have more than doubled to reach a total of 6.5 million .
" we 're super satisfied with sales , " adidas spokeswoman kirsten keck , told deutsche welle .
adidas would probably be even happier if retailers had anticipated the booming demand for german national team jerseys and ordered more from the start , particularly given the none too flexible recommended retail price of 69.95 euros -lrb- $ 88.00 -rrb- .
the home and away sets of jerseys and shorts will be restocked and available until a new line of gear is introduced toward the end of next year , several months ahead of the upcoming european tournament , according to michael lipsky , store manager of the sportarena branch in bonn .
waiting for more " we wo n't reduce the price of the german national team jerseys as these will be current for some time , but we have already dropped prices by an average of 20 percent for the jerseys of national teams that have dropped out of the competition , " lipsky told deutsche welle .
" the black away jerseys sold out quickly , and we 're still waiting to receive more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans have dressed up to view the games the bonn branch sold more shirts for the 2010 world cup than for the 2008 european cup , in which the german team played – and lost – against spain in the final , according to lipsky .
" we did n't expect this demand , " he said .
" but when a team plays well , this is reflected in sales .
and the great weather has been a factor , too . "
for the big global and european soccer tournaments organized by soccer 's world-governing body fifa , adidas and other key suppliers like nike and puma urge retailers to place their orders well in advance and not to underestimate demand .
but because retailers typically worry about sitting on large inventories of unsold products , they often err on the side of caution – a practice that has boomeranged for many stores across the country .
sold out " we thought we ordered more than plenty of the jerseys , but they sold out really fast – a lot better than in 2006 , " mo rifi , a sales manager at sport-helmreich in duesseldorf , told deutsche welle .
" all of us are surprised .
we could have sold more . "
rifi says it will take until august to complete the backorders for the popular black jersey .
which all goes to show that if the german national team chooses a black jersey again , it 's better to strike before the team - and the weather - get too hot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ? aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises health -pipe- 09.07.2010 new hiv research could lead to a vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions around the world have shown their support for aids patients and research through this red ribbon a german hiv physician says new research from the united states may offer the best hope so far in treating the millions of people worldwide who are infected with hiv , and immunizing the rest of the population . on thursday , american scientists announced that they had discovered new antibodies they say can neutralize approximately 90 percent of known strains of hiv .
this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 09.07.2010 fashionistas wilt in sweltering berlin during fashion week großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new view , after nearly a month of shin guard-clad legs this season , berlin fashion week has to compete with the fifa world cup .
but as dw 's susan stone found out , there 's plenty of rivalry at the show , with guests scrambling for free stuff and designers vying for attention . berlin fashion week officially lasts 4 days , but it sometimes it feels like a month .
the fledgling event , which celebrates its third birthday this summer , is crammed full of on- and off-site runway shows , parties , presentations , trade shows , concerts , and - even models on bikes ! from internationally known names like boss black , calvin klein , and g-star to local favorites including kaviar gauche , esther perbant and lala berlin , there 's plenty to see . and there 's star watching too - celebrities including zoe saldana , diane kruger , milla jovovich , and boris becker are on hand for the festivities . but just because the guests look good does n't mean they 're all well behaved . unfortunately , pushing , shoving , and stepping on toes can happen to the best of us .
many designers kindly treat guests to a " goodie bag " or other gift - sometimes a notebook , sometimes a tote-bag , and on occasion truly odd or generous items like boxing gloves , a porcelain coffee cup , or silver jewelry . the swag is often confined to just the first row or two , leading to some bag-jacking .
last year at the show of one designer -lrb- who will remain nameless -rrb- , third row guests grabbed first-row gifts -lrb- a brand-name hair-styling appliance -rrb- and covertly shoved them into bags and under seats , sometimes nabbing two for themselves ! at least there 's plenty of free water , energy drinks , and beer to go around . bildunterschrift : models on bikes stage an impromptu fashion show for the label reality studio sweaty stilettos and smeared mascara with sweltering temperatures of 30 degrees celsius predicted for the end of the week , berlin starts to droop . " it 's not so good for photos , " confided one street style blogger , noting that sweaty fashionistas do n't make for the freshest of images . funnily enough , the official fashion week bag given to accredited journalists include a box of fabric underarm clothing protector shields - a decidedly unglamorous but practical addition to hairspray and a mini cocktail shaker . still , a few fashionistas managed to wear opaque black tights with their trendy clogs , long sleeve silk blouses and elegant trousers without passing out in the heat . bildunterschrift : the press was welcomed with useful perks - like underarm sweat protectors competition from the pitch as if an overbooked schedule and steamy weather was n't enough , the fifa world cup is also vying for our attentions , with the final and third place games taking place this weekend . trade show bread & butter is playing to the crowd , offering up an outdoor stadium-style grandstand for 3,000 viewers , complete with a 60-square-meter television screen , and - of course - lots of beer . the semi-final match between germany and spain took place on the opening night of fashion week .
it 's tempting to imagine a similar head to head from the catwalk - custo barcelona against boss black , perhaps ? designer guido maria kretschmer , whose label is appropriately based in muenster -lrb- germany -rrb- and mallorca -lrb- spain -rrb- , presented the perhaps presciently titled collection " dancing with myself " right before kick-off .
but german efficiency insured that the models left the catwalk before the players hit the field . off site , it was world cup versus the world of calvin klein , as guests at the designer 's perfectly produced party and presentation turned their backs on underwear models -lrb- some sans underwear -rrb- to watch the game . later , those rooting for the home team could drown their sorrows and party until dawn .
one berlin journalist remarked as the game ended , " now we can concentrate on fashion for the rest of the week ! " bildunterschrift : pitch or catwalk ?

authorities were following up on claims made by a former accountant of liliane bettencourt , the heiress to the l 'oreal empire , that the billionaire 's financial adviser gave 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- in cash to eric woerth , treasurer for the ump party and now also labor minister .
the limit for donations to political parties in france is 7,500 euros .
the cash was allegedly withdrawn at the request of patrice de maistre , bettencourt 's wealth manager , whose premises police searched friday .
" when you have an investigation of this size , several investigations , this type of search is not surprising , " de maistre 's lawyer , pascal wilhelm , told news agency reuters .
sarkozy has denied the claims that his party received secret cash from the 87-year-old bettencourt and said the reports were an effort to smear him .
allies of the embattled french president have also hit back , accusing elements of the country 's media of " fascist " tactics .

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represents a significant step forward in hiv and aids research .
the antibodies - the most powerful known to scientists so far - were discovered in the cells of an african-american gay man , who is known to scientists only as donor 45 .
deutsche welle spoke with georg behrens , an immunologist and hiv physician at the university of hannover , about what this new research could yield for future treatments and a possible hiv vaccine for patients around the world . deutsche welle : what does this discovery mean and why is this significant for hiv research ? georg behrens : i think this is very important because we know that antibodies are potentially very effective molecules to fight hiv .
the problem is that everyone who gets infected with hiv produces these antibodies but they do not really work because the virus has different strategies in order to make them not useful . and over the last years there have been different trials in order to study whether we can induce immune response and antibody responses in uninfected and also infected patients in order to produce antibodies which are more effective against hiv .
there has been some progress but there has been some skepticism as to whether this is going to work because there is strong evidence that the virus can mutate and can use new strategies to avoid these antibodies from binding . what these researchers have now discovered and managed to figure out is what the best location on the virus is to have an antibody directed against so that this antibody then prevents the virus from infecting cells .
they apparently spotted an area which is extremely effective and this area can not be mutated by the virus because it needs this area ; it can not change this area in the surface in the virus and that 's why it 's so important to have this information .
this will now facilitate how to make or how to induce antibodies in other patients . as i understand it , an antibody is just a particular kind of protein . it 's a sort of protein that is produced by the immune system in response to many infections .
so that 's what we need against influenza or against other viral infections .
a big question in hiv is whether antibodies alone will do their job .
most likely they wo n't .
but they are very important , they are particularly important - many researchers believe , at least - in preventing getting the disease at all . how important they are during the course of the disease , there is more debate on this .
the hope is , with this new knowledge , to be able to generate a better vaccine that will protect people from becoming infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can be tested for the virus with just the prick of a finger so potentially this research could be used to help create an hiv / aids vaccine ? exactly .
that 's the big hope .
because that was one of the major challenges : how can we generate one , two or many antibodies in a person so that these antibodies will persist and will protect this individual for a long time even if he is exposed to the hiv virus . now i understand that this antibody that they discovered was in the body of a patient .
does that mean that this antibody could potentially be produced by anyone ? that 's an excellent question .
indeed it was hard work to screen many , many patients in order to find these specific antibodies and what 's also unique in this situation is that novel techniques from molecular biological methods were used in order to fish the antibodies out of the serum of infected people .
so it was found in a patient and now the question is : are more circumstances required to induce this antibody or is everyone principally able to produce this sort of antibody ?
that 's the major question . so far , this antibody could be produced from the cells of this patient , so you can make larger amounts of this antibody in the future and you can use it to study it more in patients or in animals , or whatever .
but the question is : is it possible in any given individual to induce this sort of antibodies ?
and that will take quite awhile before we know . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists then use laboratory analysis to determine if a person is infected with hiv this research seems very promising .
what would be the next step if these scientists have been able to say that this antibody can fight against 90 percent of known strains of hiv - presumably there would have to be confirmation of these results , yes ? yes , i think there are several questions .
one important point is - and they have already shown some results with regard to this - that this really acts , this antibody , against different strains of hiv .
the virus has different variations and looks different in different parts of the world .
but this looks very promising .
the part is done so far in vitro cultures , mostly .
so the next major question is : how efficient is this antibody in a real life situation . in an actual organism ? exactly .
in an organism like in an animal or in a patient .
would the production of the antibody and then the transfusion into a patient have an impact on the viral distribution or the replication or something else .
that 's hard to say so far .
we would have to see that .
the other question would be : how much of this antibody would be required , if you transfer it into an individual or an animal , in order to prevent an infection if that individual is exposed ?
and then coming back to what you asked already , is it possible to induce this antibody so that every individual is able to produce and generate this antibody with his own immune system .
and that 's one of the major questions . could it be possible for this antibody to be used for a treatment or a cure or does it go more in the vaccine direction ? i think it could be used for a treatment - not necessarily to broaden the spectrum of different treatments , but just to show that it 's active , it 's working and it 's protecting cells from becoming infected . in other words you could slow down or maybe even stop the production of the virus . exactly .
that would be something that would really again show that these antibodies are working and that there are other questions : for instance , how long does it circulate in patients after transfusion .
i think that it 's not very helpful in terms of eradication , in ' curing ' the disease .
the major obstacle in eradicating hiv is the virus that is already within the cells and that is probably even within the genome of the host .
and these antibodies do not act within the cells , they protect the cells from becoming infected . in the long term i think it 's most important for vaccine design and coming closer to a very effective vaccine against hiv . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this new research could lead to cheaper and more widespread hiv and aids treatment in places that need it most , like sub-saharan africa we hear a lot about how aids and hiv infection are very prevalent in the developing world and especially in sub-saharan africa .
can you give us a sense of how this might compare with other types of figures in europe , or other parts of the world ?
obviously places that have higher rates of infection are going to be more interested in this type of treatment . well , as you said , developing countries and in parts of eastern europe have a much higher prevalence of hiv-infected patients , so they have far more interest . in germany about 60,000 to 70,000 people are affected with hiv .
most of them have perfect access to the modern treatments and these medications are very effective in controlling the disease at least for a very , very long time .
we achieved also about 40 percent treatment coverage in other countries in africa for instance , and other non-developed countries , but there is still a lot of things to be done in order to really provide the required health care and the medication for everyone who is in need . so , the ultimate goal will be that we find a vaccine , because i do n't see another way to prevent other people from becoming infected .
there is no way around even with the modern treatments i do n't see a realistic points in the next 10 or 20 years really to halt this epidemic .
a vaccine is the only thing that we really can hope for . interview : cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it is being turned into a scandal that music director kent nagano announced this week that he will not renew his contract with the bavarian state opera beyond 2013 . kent nagano 's decision may not come as a surprise , but the way it came about rocks the german cultural landscape , and the conductor 's temperately worded statement hints at the tensions between culture and politics that have been running high in the bavarian capital . " it 's not the fact that he is leaving , that upsets me , " opera critic klaus j. kalchschmid told deutsche welle , " but the fact that he was forced to do so by deliberate leaks to the press . " a few days earlier , bavaria 's sueddeutsche zeitung had suggested that nagano received a call from the bavarian secretary for science , research , and art wolfgang heubisch -lrb- a dentist by trade -rrb- , who allegedly told the music director that he would be at liberty to chose the moment when he would announce " his decision " not to renew his contract . no chance to save face the indiscretion meant , of course , that nagano was no longer at liberty to wait with the announcement - even if his departure had been an open secret .
if the operation was designed to let nagano save face and exit gracefully , it failed miserable thanks to the botched execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagano is credited with bringing new repertoire to munich 's main opera house musicologist , professor , and arts writer klaus peter richter deems the affair a tragedy of errors , dating back to earlier political appointments of the directorship of the bavarian state opera ; the crux lies in the relationship between the music director and the manager of the house , he said . manager nikolaus bachler , who declined to comment on nagano 's statement , did n't take up his position until the 2008/2009 season .
nagano had already been at his post for two seasons . " why the interim administration pushed for bachler , knowing full well that he and nagano would not get along , i do n't know , " grumbled richter .
" that was a mistake already . " citing bachler 's controversial brand of aesthetic decisions for the opera house , he said that having made the future of the bavarian opera an either-or situation where one of the two - bachler or nagano - would stay on , was yet another mistake .
he would n't mind seeing a fresh start on both positions . nagano not popular enough the only point that might not be controversial , meanwhile , is the actual departure of kent nagano .
the cosmopolitan californian 's cool and reserved style , musically and socially , never quite fit the munich scene and despite demonstrative applause and standing ovations at saturday 's performance of the mozart opera " don giovanni , " he was n't enthusiastically embraced by the audience and less so critics . klaus kalchschmid , who wrote about saturday 's " don giovanni " in the sueddeutsche zeitung that the overture was shapeless and that tension was lacking throughout , suggests that it 's no wonder that someone who messes mozart or tchaikovsky up every time he tries has a hard time establishing a broad fan base . for kalchschmid , it was one of the most mediocre performances of " don giovanni " he had ever heard .
still , the critic lamented that the press has yet to write a fair piece that assesses the weaknesses and strengths of both nagano and bachler . klaus peter richter sees the latter 's weaknesses in his desire to make opera interesting by adding ever more extra-musical stimuli , a strategy he said will necessary exhaust itself sooner or later .
others , like kalchschmid , are kinder on the controversial productions that bachler has brought to munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bachler and nagano have n't made a great team , say critics nagano 's strength , meanwhile , was introducing the munich audiences to repertoire they had otherwise neglected - notably , operas by french composers francis poulenc , maurice ravel and olivier messiaen . better luck next time the upside to the behind-the-scenes operatic politicking is that arts secretary heubisch seems to know better than to try picking a music director himself and will let bachler make the choice this time . wolfram goertz from the german newspaper rheinische post is not the only one who suggests that nikolaus bachler will in that way get a candidate of his liking - most likely the young russian conductor kirill petrenko , who is the former music director of berlin 's comic opera . watching this style of running cultural institutions is little more pleasant than watching sausage being made - a fact that nagano hinted at in his statement this week when he took a dig at the incompetence of culture politics in munich . just earlier this year , the munich philharmonic and the city councilors drove conductor christian thielemann out of town .
ulrich peters , the manager of the smaller munich opera house , the gaertnerplatz theater , was also let go . kalchschmid and richter both shake their heads in embarrassment about this inadvertent musico-political theater , but at least munich gets to enjoy another little scandal . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the contrary , it is a sign of hope that relations will improve further , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at first glance , the spy swap between russia and the us looks like something from the dark days of the cold war - on friday , for the first time since 1986 , the us and russia engaged in a comprehensive spy swap , just days after the 10 russian spies were arrested in the us after an alleged decade of surveillance .
but appearances are deceptive .
this incident is not a sign of a return to the cold war between russia and the us .
the fact that this spy ring was uncovered does not mean russian-american relations will deteriorate .
in fact , quite the opposite is true .
the timing of the disclosure is unlikely to be a coincidence .
if the spy ring has indeed been under surveillance for nearly 10 years , then what is behind this official announcement - just days after russian president dmitry medvedev was in washington for talks with his us counterpart barack obama - is a calculated and well thought-out plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's ingo mannteufel ' resetting ' of relations obama 's russia policy differs from that of his predecessor george w. bush in that it tries to engage with russia , despite the differences between the two countries , rather than isolate the former superpower .
the obama administration tries to build on common interests like nuclear disarmament to foster a partnership with russia that will eventually benefit other us foreign policy goals - in particular , the us hopes to get russian support for the mission in afghanistan and its policy on alleged nuclear weapons being developed in iran .
this approach , which has been dubbed a " reset " of relations by the us administration , has already proved to be successful in the first year of obama 's presidency , when russia and the us signed the successor to the start agreement on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
russia has also taken a harder line against iran .
when the global financial crisis took hold , moscow finally understood that russia can not modernize and become a viable economic power without the help of western allies .
russia is well aware that it needs us investment as well as us support for its membership in the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has turned over a new leaf in its relations with russia clearing the air the spy swap should be seen against the backdrop of this new strategic approach of resetting us-russian relations .
the uncovering of a major russian spy ring in the us and the subsequent swift exchange of agents sends yet another signal , even in the highly sensitive area of espionage , that obama and medvedev are serious about resetting relations .
the us has thwarted a comprehensive and protracted intelligence project by the russian secret service , hoping that russia will reduce its intelligence gathering in the us .
it is unlikely , however , that russia will stop its intelligence operations in the us altogether .
even in germany , despite good relations between moscow and berlin , the russian secret service is very active , according to germany 's internal security agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 09.07.2010 octopuses have a well-developed brain , are attracted to colors and are ' delicious ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : octopuses can make out certain colors and shapes despite the recent fame of a certain eight-legged prognosticator , scientists have known about the advanced behavior of octopuses for centuries . throughout the world cup , german fans have been delighted - and most recently disappointed - by the so-called ' predictive ' ability of paul the octopus , who lives in an aquarium at the sea life oberhausen in northern germany .
paul has correctly predicted all the results of germany 's world cup matches so far by choosing between two boxes containing food rewards , each marked with the flag of a soccer team .
deutsche welle spoke with drosos koutsoubos , a professor of marine biology at the university of the aegean in greece , to learn more about octopuses .
deutsche welle : what can you tell me about octopuses in general ?
how many species are there ? can you say anything about the particular species of this one , paul , who has been ' predicting ' these football matches ?
drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

drosos koutsoubos : octopus species are seen around the world . in european waters , the most common is the octopus vulgaris , the most common octopus worldwide .
it belongs to a group of animals , the cephalopods . this group of animals , in particular octopuses , are characterized by the fact that they have a well-developed nervous system which gives them the opportunity to display advanced behavior .
they do have the possibility to learn something , to exhibit quite complicated behavior despite the fact that these are invertebrates .
so this octopus here in germany , paul , is he an octopus vulgaris ?
most probably , he is .
but i 'm not sure about that .
you must have the animal in front of you to say that with 100 percent accuracy .
this is a common species to keep in an aquarium , so probably it is that .
you know , it does n't matter if it is octopus vulgaris or another species - all of the species belonging to the genus octopus are characterized by what i mentioned earlier , a very well-developed nervous system to give them advanced behavior .
do octopuses live in all of the seas around europe ?
do they prefer one type of water temperature or one region or another ?
they 're mostly in the mediterranean and the atlantic waters up to the english channel .
this is the known distribution of the species , or at least what scientists have determined in recent years .
in the past it was thought to be all over the world - a cosmopolitan species .
this is a coastal species .
that means it lives in depths of less than 200 meters -lrb- 656 feet -rrb- , what we call the continental shelf .
and it is a common species , usually found on the sea bottom -lsb- in areas -rsb- covered with plants , sea grasses and so on .
what do octopuses typically eat ?
this typically eats crabs , mollusks , mussels .
in general , these are delicious for octopuses .
octopuses come in many different sizes .
do all of them eat the same thing , more or less ?
yes , in general , these are the organisms that they consume .
from species to species there are differences , but in general mollusks and crabs and so on are the main food they consume , because they have the capacity to catch them .
-lsb- they 're quick -rsb- , because they can swim , but it 's not easy for them to catch fish .
although sometimes , fish remains have been found in the stomach of these animals .
bildunterschrift : octopus oracle paul chose spain for the win against holland on sunday you said octopuses have a well-developed nervous system .
are they able to process visual information ?
can they see , or can they see colors ?
to a certain degree , yes .
they have a very well-developed nervous system .
these animals have been used in the past with biologists and those people working with physiology who study the way in which the nervous system is working .
their nervous system gives them the possibility to have advanced behavior .
they can recognize objects .
they have learned behavior .
they can have a good view of the surrounding area and of other organisms and they use it for communication with each other , even if they are a solitary species .
do scientists understand how octopuses are able to process visual information ?
can they see all colors ?
some colors ?
they do have a capacity to see colors .
but you know , it 's not like the bulls , in my opinion .
it is well known that in a bullfight the bull is attracted by the color red .
to my knowledge at least , a similar phenomenon has n't been proven for octopuses .
obviously , i 'm asking because of the colors of the national flags .
i 've read that paul was attracted to the flags because of certain colors or shapes .
do you think there 's anything to that or do you think it 's just random ?
well , i 'm not a specialist in the behavior of octopuses and i ca n't give you with certainty an answer to this particular question . at least to my knowledge , it 's rather a matter of random selection rather than any other selection .
of course , what is the color of their prey ?
for example , crabs or lobsters , usually among their prey , they do have a dark brown to red color , and mollusks have a pale brown to white color , or stripes .
you said that octopuses are mostly in the mediterranean and then in the atlantic , but only up to the english channel .
do they tend to stay in more temperate , warmer waters ?
yes , if we speak about octopus vulgaris .
there are other species distributed in even colder waters , and there are some that prefer warm waters .
in general , though , these creatures , the genus octopus , are not found in cold waters .
they prefer to stay in temperate waters .
you said octopuses have an advanced nervous system .
how can we observe that ?
is it because they go after moving prey and they have to be able to track it ?
no , it 's not only a matter of behavior , it 's a matter of anatomy study .
scientists have devoted a lot of study -lsb- in this area -rsb- since the beginning of the 19th century .
even the ancient greek philosopher aristotle almost 3,000 years ago knew about these characteristics of cephalopods and in particular octopuses , even with the primitive means they had at that time .
-lsb- as seen in their anatomy and through behavior -rsb- , they have a very well-developed nervous system , and they do have an advanced brain in relation to their phylogenetic position , as an invertebrate .
finally - as a marine biologist , as somebody who has studied the octopus and other marine animals , does that make you think twice about eating octopus ?
well , octopuses are a common marine biological resource .
octopuses are eaten all over the world in areas where this animal is found .
it 's also written in the texts of the ancient philosophers and writers that it is a traditional food .
in general , from what the scientists have seen from the population of this animal , they are not in any threat .
of course , we 're speaking about the rational management of these resources .
in cases where there is overfishing , then they may face a problem .
the countries around the mediterranean - not just greece and turkey , but cyprus , tunisia , spain and france - all the countries in the area are consumers of octopus .
what about you ? do you eat octopus ?
yes , of course .
it is a delicious food .
if you ever have a chance to visit us on the island of lesbos , then we could invite you to have a taste .

it is feared the law could hinder investigations into organized crime . most italian newspapers and news bulletins closed down for the day on friday , as journalists went on strike over a government bill that would restrict reporting based on wiretaps .
prime minister silvio berlusconi 's government says an anti-wiretap law is needed to protect the privacy of individuals .
however journalists are arguing it will hamper both the fight against organized crime and press reporting on corruption , though the measure is expected to exempt mafia and terrorism investigations from the restrictions .
legal and police authorities have also criticized the proposed legislation , which was approved by the italian senate in june and must now be passed by the lower house .
one of the bill 's provisions requires that a three-judge panel approve successive three-day extensions to an initial 75-day warrant to wiretap conversations .
the legislation will also prevent the publication of transcripts of recordings .
the bill would see fines of up to 464,700 euros -lrb- $ 590,000 -rrb- for journalists or editors who flout the publication restrictions .
pro-berlusconi outlets still publishing among the only newspapers being published during the strike are pro-berlusconi publications .
the right-wing il giornale , which is owned by berlusconi 's brother , was among those to hit newsstands , despite its editor speaking out against the law .
" we are not satisfied with the gag law , " vittorio feltri , editor-in-chief of the newspaper , said in a video message on il giornale 's website , adding however that he found it " wrong to gag ourselves , losing the only means that allows us to speak to our readers . "
the organization for security and cooperation in europe has also attacked the bill , saying it " could seriously hinder investigative journalism in italy . "

it expired on june 30 . renewal had been in doubt following a row between google and the chinese authorities .
after complaining that its e-mail service had been hacked in china , google in january threatened to pull out of china completely and announced it would not continue censoring search results , as required under chinese regulations .
from march onwards , the company automatically redirected the users of its chinese page google.cn to the uncensored chinese-language google page based in hong kong -lrb- google.com.hk -rrb- .
google 's operations have faced other problems in china .
its video sharing platform youtube is banned there , for example .
but as china is a huge and rapidly growing internet market , google did n't want to be completely shut out from it either .
google 's compromise retaining an internet content provider 's licence in china therefore became crucial .
in the course of negotiations about the extension , google agreed to implement a compromise : visitors to google.cn are no longer automatically redirected to the hong kong page , but a link to google.com.hk is displayed in big letters immediately underneath the search window .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many websites are blocked by the government in china the whole fight is more about taking a stance than about making a real difference : chinese users will still have an incentive to use the uncensored hong kong-based search engine .

just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .

state media said the level of the toxic chemical melamine found in samples was up to 500 times the permitted limit . 64 tons of tainted milk products have been seized by authorities in poor and remote parts of china 's northwest and northeast .
just a few days ago , a un agency for food standards set limits for the melamine concentration in food products .
for powder infant milk formula the new limit is one milligram of melamine per kilogram of formula , while for other food it is 2.5 milligrams .
this standard is identical with that of the chinese health ministry , which released its standard two years ago after the scandal involving contaminated milk powder in china shocked the world . according to official figures , the highest melamine concentration in milk products at that time exceeded 2500 milligrams per kilo .
the highly adulterated milk powder caused the death of six babies , and around 300,000 babies fell ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab assistant checks the content of melamine in milk products new rules may not help zhou qing , a close observer of the food safety situation in china , welcomes the new un guidelines .
but he does not believe the new rules can help much to improve the situation in china : " there are plenty of rules and regulations in china as far as food safety is concerned .
but as i have always emphasized : china is not lacking rules , but the rule of law .
many lawmakers , law enforcement officers as well as very normal people have no true respect towards the law . " zhou qing began to investigate food safety in china in the late 1990s .
the results were shocking .
a producer used sick and dead animals to make their well-known " braised chicken " . a famous ham producer soaked the meat in dichlorvos – a toxic pesticide , so the ham later would not attract flies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhou qing is an observer of the food safety situation in china a book about food safety based on his investigations , zhou qing published his book " what kind of god – a survey of the current safety of china 's food " in 2004 in china after having to delete two thirds of the content .
in 2006 the book won the international lettre ulysses award for the art of reportage . in his book , zhou qing forecast that scandals related to food safety would drastically increase .
with the tainted milk powder scam emerging soon after the 2008 olympics , his fears came true .
his book was acclaimed widely and was translated into different languages .
a revised version in mandarin is being published in hong kong . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many kids were hospitalized in china after consuming melamine contaminated milk products in 2008 children are more vulnerable in it , the author makes another prediction : the so-called " egg and milk project " in chinese schools will lead to the next huge scandal .
the government has ordered that school children in rural areas be given a glass of milk and an egg at low prices every day .
zhou qing says the safety of these products is not guaranteed , so the risk of children falling sick in large numbers is very high .
he believes government officials are promoting this project for their own interests : " why is the government placing advertisements for milk companies ?
there must be a hidden agenda here .
unfortunately , just as my book was going into print , two scandals relating to the ' egg and milk project ' hit the headlines in shanxi province , where hundreds of children became ill .
i am really losing hope for food safety in china . " food is the people 's heaven , a chinese saying goes .
but it seems this heaven has turned into hell for many chinese consumers . author : miao tian editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "

at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

but westerwelle 's message was unequivocal : the military presence was vital and would continue .
" the german afghanistan mission is not popular , but is , as it has always been , necessary to our own interests , " he said .
" our fellow countrymen are performing their duties in afghanistan so that we here can live safely , and we must thank them for that . "
westerwelle , along with other nato foreign ministers , is attending an afghanistan conference in kabul on july 20 .
the fact that this was the first such conference to take place in afghanistan was a sign , he said , that the west is steadily handing over responsibility to the afghan people .
since the last afghanistan conference in london in january , westerwelle claimed germany had significantly increased its civilian aid to the afghan people .
" germany 's civilian aid for the people in afghanistan has nearly doubled , " he told the parliamentarians .
" since the beginning of the year , we have also nearly doubled the number of our police instructors on the ground . "
development or war ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele made an impassioned contribution to the debate andreas schockenhoff of the christian democratic union - westerwelle 's coalition partner in government - also used his time at the podium to emphasize the progress made in the development of afghanistan 's civilian infrastructure .
at this point , veteran green party parliamentarian hans-christian stroebele lost patience and called for permission to interrupt schockenhoff . "
like the foreign minister , you are talking about an issue as if it were about effective help for a developing country , " stroebele interjected angrily .
" but the german people are not opposed to the government 's afghanistan policy because of the development projects .
the german people are against this policy because a war is being fought there .
why do n't you say what kind of war you think is right over there ? "
schockenhoff did not appreciate stroebele 's contribution .
" i think it is unacceptable that you take any opportunity - whatever is on our agenda - to keep repeating the same slogans .
we want successes in afghanistan ! " he said .
still no word on withdrawal after the united states and britain , germany is the third largest contributor of troops to the nato mission in afghanistan , with around 4,400 soldiers stationed in the increasingly violent north of the country .
with civilian and military casualties increasing , and peace apparently a long way off , westerwelle was decidedly hazy on the date of any possible withdrawal .
his best promise was a vague statement : " in this legislative period , we want to create the conditions to ensure that a step-by-step withdrawal of our military presence in afghanistan can begin . "
the opposition was quick to pounce on this lack of clarity , pointing out that the netherlands , poland and great britain have already set a date on their withdrawal .
but the debate in germany continues .

and this despite a turbulent six months , with disruptions caused by industrial action - and a volcano . germany 's biggest airline , lufthansa , says its passenger numbers have risen in the first half of 2010 , even though it was adversely affected by april 's volcanic ash cloud and a strike .
the airline says it carried around 27.2 million travelers on board its planes from january to june .
that represents an increase of 1.8 percent compared with the same period in 2009 .
for june , passenger numbers were up by 11.6 percent in comparison with the same month a year ago .
and the whole lufthansa group , which also includes swiss international airlines , austrian airlines and britain 's bmi , seems to be experiencing strong tailwinds : it carried nearly 41.8 million passengers in the first six months of the year , a rise of more than a quarter .
as another indicator of the company 's good performance , lufthansa 's seat load factor - a measure of how full planes are - improved by 2.7 percent to 77.8 percent .
like most airlines , lufthansa was badly affected by the ash cloud from the icelandic volcano in april .
it also lost an estimated 48 million euros -lrb- $ 60.7 million -rrb- through a one-day strike in february .

the priest is believed to have molested boys over more than two decades .
robert zollitsch , the archbishop of freiburg and head of the german bishops conference , acknowledged on friday that he should have looked more intensely into sexual abuse allegations coming from the priest 's congregation in 1992 .
zollitsch also said in a written statement that he regrets his diocese erroneously stated in march that it did not hear about abuse allegations before 1995 when in fact he had already began dealing with the case in 1992 .
the case largely centers on the vicar of oberharmersbach , from a parish some 55 kilometers from freiburg , who is thought to have sexually abused boys in his charge over several years .
the man was given an early retirement in 1991 with no legal recourse .
he committed suicide four years later .
so far , 17 men have come forward to the freiburg diocese with sexual abuse allegations in relation to the vicar dating back to when they were between the ages of 10 and 16 .
zollitsch went on to say he should have sought more dialog with the victims and witnesses at the time he had been alerted to the cases .
" i beg for forgiveness with all my heart , " zollitsch said .
zollitsch 's comments come at a time when the catholic church is battling allegations of sexual misconduct by priests in countries across europe and elsewhere .

now she has become a conservationist , spreading the message about how people can help to protect the pollinating insects .
" we can not afford to lose more bumblebees , " says ms williams , 39 from holywell .
" three species of bumblebee are already nationally extinct .
of the remaining 24 , 10 are in serious decline , and two are critically endangered . "
this summer a bbc project was launched called bee part of it , supported by wildlife presenter kate humble , to create local bee-friendly spaces .
the importance of bumblebees in pollination has only been discovered relatively .
" we are only just beginning to understand how important they are - for example , only bumblebees can ' buzz pollinate ' , " said ms williams .
" for many years , honeybees were used for pollinating soft fruits and tomatoes that were then discovered to be more efficiently pollinated by bumblebees .
the efficacy of bumblebees for pollination of tomatoes was not even realised until the 1980s ! "
ms williams was an early member of the bumblebee conservation trust and her twitter site , help the bees , was recently named one of the guardian 's top 50 wildlife and conservation twitter accounts .
there are a number of ways in which bumblebees can be helped to thrive she said : " there is an assumption among the public that the way to help bees is to keep hives - but this only applies to honeybees , so i have developed some tips for people to help bumblebees , because their needs and issues are slightly different . "
among the ways bumblebees can be helped are by ensuring people grow in their gardens a long season of flowering plants , including winter flowering plants .
ms williams said : " i have been working on improving my garden for bees although it 's a very small garden , a bit messy , and not all of my planting efforts have actually been successful !
" nevertheless , the small lawn is being left to revert to a piece of meadow , and currently features clover , vetch , selfheal and a number of other species coming up . "
another way bumblebees can be helped is by providing nest sites for them .
" bird boxes can provide useful homes for bumblebees , " said ms williams .
" an upturned plant pot with a hole in it , with some soft moss and dried grass , and placed under a shed could provide refuge .
even a pile of logs may provide a home for bumblebees " .
bumblebee colonies are small , with only 50 to 400 workers - honeybee colonies have about 60,000 workers .
and ms williams advises against disturbing them should you find a nest in your garden .
" bumblebees rarely sting , as they are very docile , and will provide a valuable pollination service in the area . "
another way of helping bees is to take part in monitoring bee populations .

guernseyman hubert was a member of the royal hampshire regiment and was tasked with learning more about the island under german control .
he was picked up from the same place by the royal navy after three days .
he returned , less successfully , in september 1940 and was a prisoner of war for the rest of wwii .
hubert was 20 in july 1940 and before its dissolution had served in the royal guernsey light infantry before joining the royal hampshire regiment .

media requires javascript to play .
as a guernseyman he was selected to head back to the island by submarine , under cover of darkness where he selected the hard to read south coast bay as a prime landing point for him and his newly acquired canoe .
he clambered up the cliffs and over three days gathered information from friends about the state of the island before returning to england , again via submarine at night .
this mission led to him being dubbed ' the first commando ' for the comparison between his activities and those of the officially named commandos in later months and years .
his second trip though was less successful and after the arranged rendezvous with the naval submarine did not occur hubert was trapped in guernsey where he was forced to surrender fearing the death sentence for being a spy .
a large crowd gathered for the unveiling of the commemorative stone however , this sentence never came to be thanks to the work of ambrose sherwill , the president of the states controlling committee , and the german authorities .
hubert spent the rest of the second world war in a pow camp in europe after a stay in the parisian cherche midi prison where he celebrated his 21st birthday in solitary confinement .
whilst in spangenberg pow camp hubert managed to escape by tunnelling only to be recaptured and was held until he was liberated by american forces in 1945 .
hubert was awarded the military cross for having " displayed the highest qualities of fortitude and bravery throughout " his escapades .
after the war he left the army and returned to guernsey where he worked as a life assurance salesman and was heavily involved with his old school , elizabeth college .
he died in 1998 but on the 70th anniversary of his first mission to guernsey a stone was unveiled on the cliff above la jaonnet commemorating his military service .
