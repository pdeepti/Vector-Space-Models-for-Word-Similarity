an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .
" we do n't see any conflict of interest ... on the contrary , it means a diversification , it means that we have more options , " faymann said in a news conference on saturday .
putin scorns nabucco the 7.9 billion euro nabucco project , which will also end in austria , but bypass russia by pumping gas from the caspian sea , is part of the eu 's efforts to wean itself off russian gas .
however , so far , it has no confirmed suppliers and it has been hit by several delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nabucco pipeline is part of the eu 's efforts to rely less on russia for energy " building a pipeline without supply contracts is pointless and extremely dangerous , " putin said in vienna , the austrian capital .
" name me one contract that has been signed for nabucco , " he added .
faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .
putin , meanwhile , further flexed his muscles by insisting that russia has enough resources to supply gas to europe " for the next 100 years . "
south stream is expected to go online in 2015 , one year after nabucco is currently scheduled to start operating .
russia has already secured bilateral contracts with bulgaria , greece , hungary and slovenia on south stream. ng / reuters / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .
' ill-judged , naive , and disrespectful ' " this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect uk government or fco policy or views , " a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said in response to the memo 's publication .
" many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill-judged , naive and disrespectful . "

foreign secretary david miliband was reportedly " appalled " upon finding out about the memo .
" the foreign office very much regrets this incident and is deeply sorry for the offense which it has caused , " the unnamed spokesman said .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.04.2010 bremen leads the way as germany tries to make schools more inclusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says learning together helps children most german schools can exclude children on the basis of physical or mental disability .
yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .

oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .

german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said that to get approval from berlin and the eu , greece would have to carry through with even tougher economic restructuring as " an absolute prerequisite . "
he emphasized that a " yes " was not guaranteed .
" the fact that neither the eu nor the german government have taken a decision -lsb- on providing aid -rsb- means the response can be positive as well as negative , " schaeuble told the german newspaper bild in its sunday editions .
" this depends entirely on whether greece continues in the coming years with the strict savings course it has launched .
i have made this clear to the greek finance minister . "
germany , as the biggest economy in the eurozone , would bear the largest share of the eu aid package , contributing a loan of around 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- from the kfw public bank , backed up by guarantees from the federal government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians have greece 's eu membership in their sights german leaders , facing a key regional election in may , are under intense pressure to hold a hard line against greece , with some members of the ruling conservative christian democrats even calling for greece to be kicked out of the eurozone .
french finance minister christine lagarde described the aid proposal as a " cocktail of indulgence and great strictness " in an interview with the french weekly journal du dimanche that greek finances would need close monitoring .
" we will -lsb- release the aid -rsb- according to their needs and in the case of default on repayment , we will immediately put the foot on the brake , " lagarde said .
greece ' should n't fear the imf ' at meetings in washington on saturday , eu and imf officials met with us treasury secretary to address the speed of rescue efforts for greece , with time running out for athens to pay off its debts .
on friday , greece asked for an eu-imf bailout of its debt-ridden economy .
" secretary geithner encouraged the parties in attendance to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support , " a us treasury statement said afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek finance minister papandreou has a lot of questions to answer imf managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , promised the fund would " move expeditiously " in response to greece 's appeal for help and also addressed public opposition to the bailout .
" greek citizens should n't fear the imf .
we are there to try to help them , " strauss-kahn said .
however , time is running out for greece , as it is on the precipice of becoming the first eurozone member to default on it debts .
lenders are expecting 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- from athens by may 19 .
eu satisfied , germany skeptical on friday , greece ended weeks of speculation that had permeated the eurozone by asking the eu and imf for 45 billion euros to cover its looming debts , which are believed to total some 300 billion euros .
the eu says it sees " no obstacles " to athens ' request to activate a three-year joint eu-imf rescue loan , which would offer interest rates of about 5.0 percent , far below the levels being demanded by private lenders .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that eu members had worked intensively on putting together the greek rescue package and that it " should be complete by early may .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .

oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have been able to bring about great change through democratic means that previously we could have only done with a revolution , " orban told a jubilant crowd in the capital budapest .
with nearly all votes counted , fidesz is set to fill 263 of 386 seats in parliament .
holding a two-thirds majority means orban can form the first non-coalition government in post-communist history , enabling fidesz to fast-track reforms and structural changes .
" new system " orban 's call for a new system is an allusion to the fall of communism in the country 20 years ago .
the subsequent change to democracy is known as the " change of system . " bildunterschrift : fidesz regularly attracts large crowds the prime minister-elect told supporters that fidesz will rebuild a country " ruined by oligarchs abusing their power . "

fidesz will have to move swiftly on implementing reforms .

a new deal with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- will have to be negotiated , which is likely to require substantial fiscal , labor market , education and health reforms to convince the imf that hungary can become more competitive .
in 2008 , the imf had saved hungary from the brink of bankruptcy with a billion dollar bailout package .
fidesz has pledged to cut taxes to attract foreign investment and create a million jobs in ten years .
the party also wants to curb corruption and reduce the size of parliament to make it more efficient .

the new left-wing green lmp party took 16 seats .
socialist leader ildiko lendvai , whose party has been in government for the last eight years , has handed in her resignation after her party won just 59 seats , according to preliminary data .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .
' ill-judged , naive , and disrespectful ' " this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect uk government or fco policy or views , " a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said in response to the memo 's publication .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .

yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.04.2010 bremen leads the way as germany tries to make schools more inclusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says learning together helps children most german schools can exclude children on the basis of physical or mental disability .
yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "

the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .

she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .

up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.04.2010 muslim minister-designate backs school crucifix ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezkan does not want to be regarded as " a token immigrant " ayguel oezkan , the designated social minister in lower saxony who is set to be germany 's first muslim minister of turkish origin , has caused controversy by calling for a ban on crucifixes in state schools . ayguel oezkan has created waves before even taking office as social minister in the north-western german state of lower saxony .
the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .
" we do n't see any conflict of interest ... on the contrary , it means a diversification , it means that we have more options , " faymann said in a news conference on saturday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nabucco pipeline is part of the eu 's efforts to rely less on russia for energy " building a pipeline without supply contracts is pointless and extremely dangerous , " putin said in vienna , the austrian capital .
" name me one contract that has been signed for nabucco , " he added .
faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .
putin , meanwhile , further flexed his muscles by insisting that russia has enough resources to supply gas to europe " for the next 100 years . "

the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .
" we do n't see any conflict of interest ... on the contrary , it means a diversification , it means that we have more options , " faymann said in a news conference on saturday .
putin scorns nabucco the 7.9 billion euro nabucco project , which will also end in austria , but bypass russia by pumping gas from the caspian sea , is part of the eu 's efforts to wean itself off russian gas .
however , so far , it has no confirmed suppliers and it has been hit by several delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nabucco pipeline is part of the eu 's efforts to rely less on russia for energy " building a pipeline without supply contracts is pointless and extremely dangerous , " putin said in vienna , the austrian capital .
" name me one contract that has been signed for nabucco , " he added .
faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .
putin , meanwhile , further flexed his muscles by insisting that russia has enough resources to supply gas to europe " for the next 100 years . "
south stream is expected to go online in 2015 , one year after nabucco is currently scheduled to start operating .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .

faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .

" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .
' ill-judged , naive , and disrespectful ' " this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect uk government or fco policy or views , " a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said in response to the memo 's publication .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .

oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .

just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.04.2010 bremen leads the way as germany tries to make schools more inclusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says learning together helps children most german schools can exclude children on the basis of physical or mental disability .
yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .
' ill-judged , naive , and disrespectful ' " this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect uk government or fco policy or views , " a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said in response to the memo 's publication .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .
' ill-judged , naive , and disrespectful ' " this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect uk government or fco policy or views , " a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said in response to the memo 's publication .
" many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill-judged , naive and disrespectful . "

foreign secretary david miliband was reportedly " appalled " upon finding out about the memo .
" the foreign office very much regrets this incident and is deeply sorry for the offense which it has caused , " the unnamed spokesman said .

german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said that to get approval from berlin and the eu , greece would have to carry through with even tougher economic restructuring as " an absolute prerequisite . "
he emphasized that a " yes " was not guaranteed .
" the fact that neither the eu nor the german government have taken a decision -lsb- on providing aid -rsb- means the response can be positive as well as negative , " schaeuble told the german newspaper bild in its sunday editions .
" this depends entirely on whether greece continues in the coming years with the strict savings course it has launched .
i have made this clear to the greek finance minister . "
germany , as the biggest economy in the eurozone , would bear the largest share of the eu aid package , contributing a loan of around 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- from the kfw public bank , backed up by guarantees from the federal government .

french finance minister christine lagarde described the aid proposal as a " cocktail of indulgence and great strictness " in an interview with the french weekly journal du dimanche that greek finances would need close monitoring .
" we will -lsb- release the aid -rsb- according to their needs and in the case of default on repayment , we will immediately put the foot on the brake , " lagarde said .
greece ' should n't fear the imf ' at meetings in washington on saturday , eu and imf officials met with us treasury secretary to address the speed of rescue efforts for greece , with time running out for athens to pay off its debts .

" secretary geithner encouraged the parties in attendance to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support , " a us treasury statement said afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek finance minister papandreou has a lot of questions to answer imf managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , promised the fund would " move expeditiously " in response to greece 's appeal for help and also addressed public opposition to the bailout .
" greek citizens should n't fear the imf .
we are there to try to help them , " strauss-kahn said .
however , time is running out for greece , as it is on the precipice of becoming the first eurozone member to default on it debts .
lenders are expecting 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- from athens by may 19 .
eu satisfied , germany skeptical on friday , greece ended weeks of speculation that had permeated the eurozone by asking the eu and imf for 45 billion euros to cover its looming debts , which are believed to total some 300 billion euros .
the eu says it sees " no obstacles " to athens ' request to activate a three-year joint eu-imf rescue loan , which would offer interest rates of about 5.0 percent , far below the levels being demanded by private lenders .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that eu members had worked intensively on putting together the greek rescue package and that it " should be complete by early may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.04.2010 one state tackles problem of rural doctor shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in some rural areas have a hard time finding doctors germany ’ s health ministry says there ’ s a nationwide shortage of 3,600 general medical practitioners .
an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.04.2010 muslim minister-designate backs school crucifix ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezkan does not want to be regarded as " a token immigrant " ayguel oezkan , the designated social minister in lower saxony who is set to be germany 's first muslim minister of turkish origin , has caused controversy by calling for a ban on crucifixes in state schools . ayguel oezkan has created waves before even taking office as social minister in the north-western german state of lower saxony .
the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.04.2010 bremen leads the way as germany tries to make schools more inclusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says learning together helps children most german schools can exclude children on the basis of physical or mental disability .
yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

" we have been able to bring about great change through democratic means that previously we could have only done with a revolution , " orban told a jubilant crowd in the capital budapest .
with nearly all votes counted , fidesz is set to fill 263 of 386 seats in parliament .
holding a two-thirds majority means orban can form the first non-coalition government in post-communist history , enabling fidesz to fast-track reforms and structural changes .
" new system " orban 's call for a new system is an allusion to the fall of communism in the country 20 years ago .
the subsequent change to democracy is known as the " change of system . " bildunterschrift : fidesz regularly attracts large crowds the prime minister-elect told supporters that fidesz will rebuild a country " ruined by oligarchs abusing their power . "
orban , who was prime minister from 1998 to 2002 , is a former liberal anti-communist dissident with a strong anti-globalization stance .
fidesz will have to move swiftly on implementing reforms .

a new deal with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- will have to be negotiated , which is likely to require substantial fiscal , labor market , education and health reforms to convince the imf that hungary can become more competitive .
in 2008 , the imf had saved hungary from the brink of bankruptcy with a billion dollar bailout package .
fidesz has pledged to cut taxes to attract foreign investment and create a million jobs in ten years .
the party also wants to curb corruption and reduce the size of parliament to make it more efficient .

the far-right party is known for its anti-roma , anti-semitic and anti-eu stance .
the new left-wing green lmp party took 16 seats .
socialist leader ildiko lendvai , whose party has been in government for the last eight years , has handed in her resignation after her party won just 59 seats , according to preliminary data .
fidesz had won an outright majority in the first round of the elections on april 11 by winning 206 of 386 seats. ng / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .

yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .
" we do n't see any conflict of interest ... on the contrary , it means a diversification , it means that we have more options , " faymann said in a news conference on saturday .
putin scorns nabucco the 7.9 billion euro nabucco project , which will also end in austria , but bypass russia by pumping gas from the caspian sea , is part of the eu 's efforts to wean itself off russian gas .
however , so far , it has no confirmed suppliers and it has been hit by several delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nabucco pipeline is part of the eu 's efforts to rely less on russia for energy " building a pipeline without supply contracts is pointless and extremely dangerous , " putin said in vienna , the austrian capital .
" name me one contract that has been signed for nabucco , " he added .
faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .
putin , meanwhile , further flexed his muscles by insisting that russia has enough resources to supply gas to europe " for the next 100 years . "
south stream is expected to go online in 2015 , one year after nabucco is currently scheduled to start operating .
russia has already secured bilateral contracts with bulgaria , greece , hungary and slovenia on south stream. ng / reuters / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .

in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .
" we do n't see any conflict of interest ... on the contrary , it means a diversification , it means that we have more options , " faymann said in a news conference on saturday .
putin scorns nabucco the 7.9 billion euro nabucco project , which will also end in austria , but bypass russia by pumping gas from the caspian sea , is part of the eu 's efforts to wean itself off russian gas .
however , so far , it has no confirmed suppliers and it has been hit by several delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nabucco pipeline is part of the eu 's efforts to rely less on russia for energy " building a pipeline without supply contracts is pointless and extremely dangerous , " putin said in vienna , the austrian capital .
" name me one contract that has been signed for nabucco , " he added .
faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .
putin , meanwhile , further flexed his muscles by insisting that russia has enough resources to supply gas to europe " for the next 100 years . "
south stream is expected to go online in 2015 , one year after nabucco is currently scheduled to start operating .
russia has already secured bilateral contracts with bulgaria , greece , hungary and slovenia on south stream. ng / reuters / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.04.2010 one state tackles problem of rural doctor shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in some rural areas have a hard time finding doctors germany ’ s health ministry says there ’ s a nationwide shortage of 3,600 general medical practitioners .
an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 25.04.2010 austria and russia sign south stream pipeline agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gazprom is south stream 's main backer austria has signed up to build part of russia 's south stream gas pipeline , while keeping a hand in the competing european pipeline nabucco . austria on saturday signed an agreement with russia that will see the alpine state build part of russia 's south stream gas pipeline .
the 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 26.7 billion dollar -rrb- pipeline , which is backed by russia 's gazprom and italian utility eni , is expected to pump russian gas under the black sea through bulgaria , before branching off into austria and greece .
south sea will allow russia to strengthen its market share in europe , while a competing project , the european-led nabucco pipeline , will bypass russia in an effort to reduce europe 's dependence on russian gas .
although austria is also involved in the nabucco project , its chancellor werner faymann believes austria can play a role in both pipelines .
" we do n't see any conflict of interest ... on the contrary , it means a diversification , it means that we have more options , " faymann said in a news conference on saturday .
putin scorns nabucco the 7.9 billion euro nabucco project , which will also end in austria , but bypass russia by pumping gas from the caspian sea , is part of the eu 's efforts to wean itself off russian gas .
however , so far , it has no confirmed suppliers and it has been hit by several delays .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nabucco pipeline is part of the eu 's efforts to rely less on russia for energy " building a pipeline without supply contracts is pointless and extremely dangerous , " putin said in vienna , the austrian capital .
" name me one contract that has been signed for nabucco , " he added .
faymann was keen to downplay the conflict between russia and europe by stressing that austria could benefit from both systems .
he also pointed out that it was by no means clear where exactly the gas supplies for nabucco would come from .

a leaked memo from the ministry contained a list of scandalous suggestions for pope benedict xvi 's first visit to the uk .
the british sunday telegraph newspaper published excerpts of the memo , which included the results of a " brainstorming " session of civil servants planning for the september visit .
among the activities proposed for the head of the catholic church : formally opening an abortion ward at a local hospital , blessing a gay marriage , launching his own branded line of condoms , and " sacking dodgy bishops . " the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .
' ill-judged , naive , and disrespectful ' " this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect uk government or fco policy or views , " a spokesman for the foreign and commonwealth office said in response to the memo 's publication .
" many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill-judged , naive and disrespectful . "

foreign secretary david miliband was reportedly " appalled " upon finding out about the memo .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .

" we have been able to bring about great change through democratic means that previously we could have only done with a revolution , " orban told a jubilant crowd in the capital budapest .
with nearly all votes counted , fidesz is set to fill 263 of 386 seats in parliament .
holding a two-thirds majority means orban can form the first non-coalition government in post-communist history , enabling fidesz to fast-track reforms and structural changes .
" new system " orban 's call for a new system is an allusion to the fall of communism in the country 20 years ago .
the subsequent change to democracy is known as the " change of system . " bildunterschrift : fidesz regularly attracts large crowds the prime minister-elect told supporters that fidesz will rebuild a country " ruined by oligarchs abusing their power . "
orban , who was prime minister from 1998 to 2002 , is a former liberal anti-communist dissident with a strong anti-globalization stance .
fidesz will have to move swiftly on implementing reforms .
the most pressing issue is the country 's finances .
a new deal with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- will have to be negotiated , which is likely to require substantial fiscal , labor market , education and health reforms to convince the imf that hungary can become more competitive .
in 2008 , the imf had saved hungary from the brink of bankruptcy with a billion dollar bailout package .
fidesz has pledged to cut taxes to attract foreign investment and create a million jobs in ten years .
the party also wants to curb corruption and reduce the size of parliament to make it more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary was bailed out by the imf in 2008 swing to the right hungary 's swing to the right was further underscored by the jobbik party 's first entry into parliament with 47 seats , making it the third-largest force in parliament .
the far-right party is known for its anti-roma , anti-semitic and anti-eu stance .
the new left-wing green lmp party took 16 seats .
socialist leader ildiko lendvai , whose party has been in government for the last eight years , has handed in her resignation after her party won just 59 seats , according to preliminary data .
fidesz had won an outright majority in the first round of the elections on april 11 by winning 206 of 386 seats. ng / reuters / dpa / afp editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .

we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.04.2010 bremen leads the way as germany tries to make schools more inclusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says learning together helps children most german schools can exclude children on the basis of physical or mental disability .
yet that contravenes a un resolution that has now been approved by the government in berlin .
bremen is the first city to adapt . the majority of mainstream german schools are still legally entitled to exclude physically or mentally disabled children on the basis of their handicap .
the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

the education board in the northern city-state of bremen has become the first to promise to stop this practice , but a federal government ruling in berlin means that all of germany 's school authorities will soon have to follow suit .
bremen is not abandoning the concept of specialist schools for disabled children , but it is promising not to exclude children from its mainstream schools on the basis of their disability .
the only schools which the change in policy does n't affect are the so-called ' gymnasien ' – high schools set aside for german children with top academic scores .
bremen 's senator for education , renate juergens-pieper , has come under fire from the local press who say that the transition has been too hasty , and that children with special needs can be better looked after in specialist institutions .
" this argument is a typically german one , " juergens-pieper , from the social democrats , said .
" we have this structured school system here , in which we are constantly trying to divide kids into categories – based on their strengths , their weaknesses , and so on .
most other countries got rid of that system long ago . "
inclusion vs. specialization teachers with disabled children in their classrooms are to have an assistant with specialist experience , as schools try to ensure a smooth transition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some children can still be turned away by schools " we have a clear mandate , we ca n't experiment here , " said gerd menkens , the headmaster of bremen 's high school ' am pfaelzer weg ' , which is preparing to accept disabled children in the next school year .
" the new plan simply can not fail , legally , it must be a success . "
the elementary school for children aged six to 13 that is partnered with this school has already started integrating its classes .
one of the biggest concerns surrounding the incoming legislation is the possibility that disabled children could be left behind in larger classes .
" the most important thing is to teach all the children at their individual levels of performance , " said helmut brandenburg , a father of two , one of whom is disabled .
" some schools can do that already , but an awful lot of them can not . "
" my biggest worry would be that the child was left behind , so to speak , not developing , and not integrating into the normal class .
disabled children will start on a level playing field but , if neglected , they could lose touch with the class and end up isolated . "
slow start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classrooms all across germany will have to adapt - eventually a recent un report on education in germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , criticized the state for failing to start implementing the decision made in berlin early in 2009 .
" the political will appears to be present , " wrote the report 's author , vernor munoz , " but there is a big difference between words and deeds . "
the local minister for schools has spoken out in favor of the new legislation , but as yet there has been no local legislation to accompany this .
" it is not acceptable if children go to the same schools but are put into different classes , " the report also stated .
many schools across the country already have physically and mentally disabled students , but they have the chance to choose whom they accept , and sometimes turn away children they feel they can not cope with .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .

there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .

there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .

" we have been able to bring about great change through democratic means that previously we could have only done with a revolution , " orban told a jubilant crowd in the capital budapest .
with nearly all votes counted , fidesz is set to fill 263 of 386 seats in parliament .
holding a two-thirds majority means orban can form the first non-coalition government in post-communist history , enabling fidesz to fast-track reforms and structural changes .
" new system " orban 's call for a new system is an allusion to the fall of communism in the country 20 years ago .
the subsequent change to democracy is known as the " change of system . " bildunterschrift : fidesz regularly attracts large crowds the prime minister-elect told supporters that fidesz will rebuild a country " ruined by oligarchs abusing their power . "

an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.04.2010 one state tackles problem of rural doctor shortage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in some rural areas have a hard time finding doctors germany ’ s health ministry says there ’ s a nationwide shortage of 3,600 general medical practitioners .
an incentive program for medical students in the state of saxony is helping to address the shortfall there . the federal government estimates that around 1,800 general practitioners are needed in germany 's rural areas to adequately cover the needs of patients living there .
if nothing is done , the situation is set to become critical .
german health minister phillip roesler is considering introducing a quota system to make sure that people living in remote regions have access to adequate care .
the eastern state of saxony alone needs 300 country doctors .
the state government there however has developed a subsidy program to address the shortfall of doctors . it offers students financial support during their studies and the students , in return , agree to work in rural areas for four years after their studies are completed .
marcus koehler , a third-year medical student at leipzig university always wanted to become a rural doctor .
the 22-year-old says the subsidies program has made it easier for him to make the decision to work in the country once he gets his degree .
" i do n't think this needs much explaining , the subsidy is a great financial help , that of course i gladly accept , " he said .
subsidies help students make decisions third-year medical students receive 300 euros per month for the first two years .
this increases to 400 euros the following year , and jumps to 600 euros in the final subsidy year .
without the subsidies , few medicine students would be able to afford to work in rural areas .
doctors working in urban areas earn more .
urban life is also more exciting , plus , cities generally offer better career opportunities .
koehler agrees that becoming country doctor will be hard work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students also learn basic important skills , like taking blood samples " my future medical practice will probably cover many small villages with relatively few inhabitants , which means i 'm going to be doing a lot of driving , " he said .
" my working hours wo n't be quite as comfortable in the country . "
in addition to providing financial assistance , the state government in saxony has also introduced a program where student-doctors work in an established medical practice to learn the ropes .
" we find a doctor we 'd like to work with in a rural area we 'd like to work in and agree to spend one day a month there while we study , " said medical student florian braunseis .
" it 's important we meet their patients and help treat them over the long period of time . "
getting to know patients braunseis performs his voluntary duty at a practice near his home .
he already knows the people who live there and works for his own doctor .
the 24-year old says the practice is right in the area that the media has pointed out as being worst affected by the doctor shortage .
" my doctor works in torgau-oschatz .
i always start work early , about 7 am , before anyone else is there .
i see the patients during consultation hours , take their blood – we need to practice that regularly , because we do n't learn that at medical school . "
the government 's incentive scheme has convinced quite a few medical students in the state of saxony to become country doctors - and it might become a model scheme for germany 's other 15 states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.04.2010 muslim minister-designate backs school crucifix ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezkan does not want to be regarded as " a token immigrant " ayguel oezkan , the designated social minister in lower saxony who is set to be germany 's first muslim minister of turkish origin , has caused controversy by calling for a ban on crucifixes in state schools . ayguel oezkan has created waves before even taking office as social minister in the north-western german state of lower saxony .
the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .

german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said that to get approval from berlin and the eu , greece would have to carry through with even tougher economic restructuring as " an absolute prerequisite . "
he emphasized that a " yes " was not guaranteed .
" the fact that neither the eu nor the german government have taken a decision -lsb- on providing aid -rsb- means the response can be positive as well as negative , " schaeuble told the german newspaper bild in its sunday editions .
" this depends entirely on whether greece continues in the coming years with the strict savings course it has launched .
i have made this clear to the greek finance minister . "
germany , as the biggest economy in the eurozone , would bear the largest share of the eu aid package , contributing a loan of around 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- from the kfw public bank , backed up by guarantees from the federal government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians have greece 's eu membership in their sights german leaders , facing a key regional election in may , are under intense pressure to hold a hard line against greece , with some members of the ruling conservative christian democrats even calling for greece to be kicked out of the eurozone .
french finance minister christine lagarde described the aid proposal as a " cocktail of indulgence and great strictness " in an interview with the french weekly journal du dimanche that greek finances would need close monitoring .
" we will -lsb- release the aid -rsb- according to their needs and in the case of default on repayment , we will immediately put the foot on the brake , " lagarde said .
greece ' should n't fear the imf ' at meetings in washington on saturday , eu and imf officials met with us treasury secretary to address the speed of rescue efforts for greece , with time running out for athens to pay off its debts .
on friday , greece asked for an eu-imf bailout of its debt-ridden economy .
" secretary geithner encouraged the parties in attendance to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support , " a us treasury statement said afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek finance minister papandreou has a lot of questions to answer imf managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , promised the fund would " move expeditiously " in response to greece 's appeal for help and also addressed public opposition to the bailout .
" greek citizens should n't fear the imf .
we are there to try to help them , " strauss-kahn said .
however , time is running out for greece , as it is on the precipice of becoming the first eurozone member to default on it debts .
lenders are expecting 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- from athens by may 19 .
eu satisfied , germany skeptical on friday , greece ended weeks of speculation that had permeated the eurozone by asking the eu and imf for 45 billion euros to cover its looming debts , which are believed to total some 300 billion euros .
the eu says it sees " no obstacles " to athens ' request to activate a three-year joint eu-imf rescue loan , which would offer interest rates of about 5.0 percent , far below the levels being demanded by private lenders .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that eu members had worked intensively on putting together the greek rescue package and that it " should be complete by early may .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .

yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

as the fair opened its doors for 2010 , director daniel hug spoke to deutsche welle about why it is as relevant as ever . deutsche welle : how would you sum up art cologne 2010 ?
daniel hug : i would say it 's probably the most comprehensive look at the avant-garde from the last hundred years , or the last 110 years , in one place .
we have 202 exhibitors from all over the world ... exhibiting artworks starting from 1900 up until the most cutting-edge , newest , shooting stars of today .
have people have been having trouble getting to europe this year because of the volcano in iceland and airline disruptions ?
we are two hours from amsterdam by train , we 're an hour and a half from brussels by train , we 're three and a half hours from paris by train .
we 're in this multicultural european hub ...
still , most of our visitors have not made it .
our overseas visitors - american collectors , even collectors from hungary , from russia -lrb- could n't get here . -rrb-
yet the opening last night was incredibly full , fuller than last year actually , and that had a lot to do with the press that sort of motivated a lot of people in the area , in holland and belgium , in germany , to come to the fair .
the art cologne program new positions , which sponsors less-known artists , turns thirty this year .
what do you see as new positions ' place in the fair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art cologne has helped launch artists like neo rauch art cologne was the first fair to introduce financial aid , i guess you could call it , for young artists . ... these would be presented by galleries , exhibitors that were already admitted into the fair , who would then make a suggestion of a young artist .
there were certain criteria .
it has nothing to do with age necessarily but more to do with exhibiting history .
they ca n't have had a museum exhibition – stuff like that .
if you look at the recipients of the new positions in the past it 's pretty incredible .
many are quite well known .
for example neo rauch was a new positions -lsb- artist -rsb- 14 years ago .
rosemarie trockel , thomas ruff – just off the top of my head .
i would say one every year has gone on to actually become something .
of course i think that also reflects the quality of the gallery that suggests the new position , and by improving the quality of the galleries exhibiting in the main section of the fair , of course the new positions become more interesting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : works from contemporary artists like gerhard richter are popular what changes have you made to keep art cologne relevant ?
the art cologne is really two fairs .
on the ground level we have a more conservative , blue chip , secondary dealer fair of galleries that present modern art , post-war art . and then upstairs we have the second fair which is really a contemporary art fair .
very few of the collectors from either fair cross over .
but a few do , so the crossover is kind of nice .
i see that as one of our strengths , that we are sort of a crossover fair between these two fairs that the art cologne actually is .
reducing the size of the fair was very important , which i did last year , and one of the ways that i did that was to divide it on two levels , creating two small fairs rather than one large fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visitor passes an artwork by artist katrin mayer art cologne is one of the oldest art fairs in the world .
what are your plans for it ?
my strategy is to focus not only on the classical modern and the post-war and to support the long-term exhibitors that have been showing here -lsb- for -rsb- 40 years , like galerie thomas , but also to work and support a new generation , the young generation that 's maybe shifting away from berlin , that wants to have its own identity , that 's not necessarily getting into the other fairs .
so these two extremes , of functioning both as a very traditional fair , but also looking ahead , supporting young , new galleries , but also providing the whole spectrum that 's in between .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said that to get approval from berlin and the eu , greece would have to carry through with even tougher economic restructuring as " an absolute prerequisite . "
he emphasized that a " yes " was not guaranteed .
" the fact that neither the eu nor the german government have taken a decision -lsb- on providing aid -rsb- means the response can be positive as well as negative , " schaeuble told the german newspaper bild in its sunday editions .
" this depends entirely on whether greece continues in the coming years with the strict savings course it has launched .
i have made this clear to the greek finance minister . "
germany , as the biggest economy in the eurozone , would bear the largest share of the eu aid package , contributing a loan of around 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- from the kfw public bank , backed up by guarantees from the federal government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians have greece 's eu membership in their sights german leaders , facing a key regional election in may , are under intense pressure to hold a hard line against greece , with some members of the ruling conservative christian democrats even calling for greece to be kicked out of the eurozone .
french finance minister christine lagarde described the aid proposal as a " cocktail of indulgence and great strictness " in an interview with the french weekly journal du dimanche that greek finances would need close monitoring .
" we will -lsb- release the aid -rsb- according to their needs and in the case of default on repayment , we will immediately put the foot on the brake , " lagarde said .
greece ' should n't fear the imf ' at meetings in washington on saturday , eu and imf officials met with us treasury secretary to address the speed of rescue efforts for greece , with time running out for athens to pay off its debts .
on friday , greece asked for an eu-imf bailout of its debt-ridden economy .
" secretary geithner encouraged the parties in attendance to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support , " a us treasury statement said afterwards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek finance minister papandreou has a lot of questions to answer imf managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , promised the fund would " move expeditiously " in response to greece 's appeal for help and also addressed public opposition to the bailout .
" greek citizens should n't fear the imf .
we are there to try to help them , " strauss-kahn said .
however , time is running out for greece , as it is on the precipice of becoming the first eurozone member to default on it debts .
lenders are expecting 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 11 billion -rrb- from athens by may 19 .
eu satisfied , germany skeptical on friday , greece ended weeks of speculation that had permeated the eurozone by asking the eu and imf for 45 billion euros to cover its looming debts , which are believed to total some 300 billion euros .
the eu says it sees " no obstacles " to athens ' request to activate a three-year joint eu-imf rescue loan , which would offer interest rates of about 5.0 percent , far below the levels being demanded by private lenders .
eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn said that eu members had worked intensively on putting together the greek rescue package and that it " should be complete by early may .

" the suggestions alluded to the catholic church 's prohibitions on abortion , contraceptives , and homosexuality .
the last refers to the ongoing scandal involving sexual abuse committed by priests .
the memo also suggested the pontiff perform a duet with queen elizabeth and do somersaults with children to promote exercise .

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state school crucifix ban in germany is not a new debate " i have made it clear that i intend to take over the area of integration .
up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 38-year-old , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said in an interview on saturday that crucifixes have as little place in state schools as do headscarves .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " oezkan told german weekly magazine focus , adding that " schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own .
just as head scarves do not belong in classrooms . "
comments spark criticism from conservatives oezkan 's comments have ruffled feathers in her own conservative party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff says the cross and the cdu are ' inseparable ' lower saxony state premier , christian wulff , distanced himself from the designated minister 's remarks .
" christian symbols , above all the crucifix in schools , are welcomed by the state government in lower saxony in keeping with the practice of tolerant education on the basis of christian values , " wulff told news agency dpa .
he added that students wearing headscarves were also tolerated on grounds of religious freedom but not teachers .
" ms oezkan expressed her personal opinion on religious neutrality , but she 's not questioning the practice in lower saxony . "
but stefan mueller , cdu commissioner for integration , was openly critical .
" -lsb- oezkan 's remarks -rsb- are as absurd as they are appalling , " mueller said in a statement .
" politicians who want to ban the cross in state schools should think twice about whether representing a christian party is the right choice .
the crucifix is the foundation of our identity , culture , and values , " he added .
not just a ' token immigrant ' the 38-year-old oezkan is the first muslim woman in germany to be elected to a ministerial post on the state level .
she was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants .
a trained lawyer , oezkan joined the cdu six years ago .
before her ministerial appointment , she was the party 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg .
her appointment is widely seen as a coup for merkel 's conservative party who are keen to attract voters from germany 's large immigrant population .
earlier this month , christian wulff called her appointment " a good signal for children and young people with immigrant backgrounds . " oezkan however quickly made clear that she does not want to be regarded as a " token immigrant . "
oezkan has said as social minister she will focus her efforts on furthering integration in lower saxony , something she says the ministry has lost sight of in recent years .

up to now , integration has been more and more part of the interior ministry , but this is an area where i would like to make an impact , " she told the focus magazine .
oezkan has singled out the need for germany to establish proper recognition of university degrees earned abroad .
" it can go on no longer that well-educated and able citizens are forced to drive taxis when they arrive in germany , " oezkan said .
oezkan has been given police protection in recent days . according to authorities , she has received letters and emails threatening that " something would happen " if she accepts her post , which is scheduled for tuesday. glb / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
