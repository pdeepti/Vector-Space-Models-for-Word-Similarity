in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .

van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .
uruguay faces the loser of the germany-spain game in the match for third place in the tournament on saturday .

will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : middle east peace process israel eases blockade of gaza strip amid diplomatic flap with germany us envoy pushes for progress as israel and palestinians stall on peace israel 's reputation in tatters as eu , world powers review relations us and europe tacitly seek ways to bring hamas to the negotiating table middle east -pipe- 06.07.2010 israel , palestinians lack alternatives to faltering two-state solution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel lacks the will to make the two-state solution a reality with the implementation of the two-state solution becoming increasingly unlikely , israel and the palestinians must search for alternatives .
however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 06.07.2010 court gives doctors right to pre-select embryos for implantation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a perfect embryo ?
germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

but the hope in washington that the lisbon treaty would lead to a coherent eu foreign policy has n't yet been fulfilled . the pleas coming out of the us , urging europe to act as an effective global player alongside washington are legendary .
for decades , us administrations - both democratic or republican - have been complaining that the economic giant that is europe punches way below its weight in world politics .
and they have been cajoling the europeans incessantly to engage in burden-sharing and get their act together .
of course nothing changed substantially - until the lisbon treaty came around and with it the chance for a serious overhaul of europe 's decision-making process in the foreign policy arena .
but then europe 's leaders , as a first step of implementing the treaty , opted not for two well-known and widely respected veterans to become president and top diplomat for the new eu .
instead they chose in herman van rompuy and catherine ashton a duo to act as the new figureheads for the eu who most europeans had never heard of before they were nominated .
to be sure , both had previous political experience and until now have done a good enough job .
but the message conveyed by this personnel selection clearly was n't one of revolutionary change coming to and from brussels . what 's more , internal strains and divisions even surfaced in the economic sphere , the one area where the eu is considered a global heavyweight .
protracted public squabbling over the response to greece 's financial collapse had not only negative consequences for international markets , but further damaged the eu 's image as a global actor .
constructive poliphony so what will it take for europe to have a foreign policy cast from the same mold ?
" the bad news is that , in that sense the europeans will never get their act together , " kalypso nicolaidis , professor of international relations at oxford university , told deutsche welle .
nicolaidis was part of the so-called eu reflection group chaired by former spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez that delivered its report on the future of the eu to president rompuy in may .
" europeans will always be about poliphony and in their bad days even cacophony , " says nicolaidis .
" and to me europeans as well as americans need to understand that the goal should be that this is a constructive poliphony , a poliphony that makes sense . "
she believes if we continue to judge europe based on its ability to speak with one voice , we are bound to be disappointed .
because that wo n't ever happen , predicts nicolaidis .
bildunterschrift : eu heads of state will continue to play a role in european foreign policy instead , she argues , europe and the us must first acknowledge the limits of europe 's structural setup and then come to grips with it and make the best out of it .
progress , not perfection while being far from perfect , the lisbon treaty and with it the new external action service still has the potential to enhance europe 's role in the world , argue experts .
it just , wo n't happen overnight , says michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies .
" i think it 's perfectly understandable that the setting up of the external action service takes a year to complete like every complex corporate merger takes time to be sorted out . "
to underscore that the lisbon treaty has indeed changed the thinking within the eu emerson tells an anecdote that happened two weeks ago .
" chancellor merkel and president medvedev said how about having a european-russian security council between lavrov and ashton , just the two of them together . "
the idea of an eu-russian security council with only ashton instead of the all the various defense ministers representing the eu was well-received , adds emerson . " and even more interesting is the idea that is beginning to float around in european circles to make it a trilateral meeting with hillary clinton as well .
all of that could prove a really quite interesting and positive innovation as an example of how these new structures can lead to innovations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants europe to play a more active global role so if europeans and americans let go of the notion that europe will ever speak with one voice and that it can remodel its decision-making process from that of a union of countries to a nation state , progress is possible , says nicolaidis .
she considers the lisbon treaty simply as a shell .
an important one , but still only a shell , that must be filled .
" we europeans need to organize ourselves in such a way that our diversity really becomes a strength , " says nicolaïdis .
" and i would be the first one to admit that this is not the case now . "

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .

mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .

but the hope in washington that the lisbon treaty would lead to a coherent eu foreign policy has n't yet been fulfilled . the pleas coming out of the us , urging europe to act as an effective global player alongside washington are legendary .
for decades , us administrations - both democratic or republican - have been complaining that the economic giant that is europe punches way below its weight in world politics .
and they have been cajoling the europeans incessantly to engage in burden-sharing and get their act together .
of course nothing changed substantially - until the lisbon treaty came around and with it the chance for a serious overhaul of europe 's decision-making process in the foreign policy arena .
but then europe 's leaders , as a first step of implementing the treaty , opted not for two well-known and widely respected veterans to become president and top diplomat for the new eu .
instead they chose in herman van rompuy and catherine ashton a duo to act as the new figureheads for the eu who most europeans had never heard of before they were nominated .
to be sure , both had previous political experience and until now have done a good enough job .
but the message conveyed by this personnel selection clearly was n't one of revolutionary change coming to and from brussels . what 's more , internal strains and divisions even surfaced in the economic sphere , the one area where the eu is considered a global heavyweight .
protracted public squabbling over the response to greece 's financial collapse had not only negative consequences for international markets , but further damaged the eu 's image as a global actor .
constructive poliphony so what will it take for europe to have a foreign policy cast from the same mold ?
" the bad news is that , in that sense the europeans will never get their act together , " kalypso nicolaidis , professor of international relations at oxford university , told deutsche welle .
nicolaidis was part of the so-called eu reflection group chaired by former spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez that delivered its report on the future of the eu to president rompuy in may .
" europeans will always be about poliphony and in their bad days even cacophony , " says nicolaidis .
" and to me europeans as well as americans need to understand that the goal should be that this is a constructive poliphony , a poliphony that makes sense . "
she believes if we continue to judge europe based on its ability to speak with one voice , we are bound to be disappointed .
because that wo n't ever happen , predicts nicolaidis .
bildunterschrift : eu heads of state will continue to play a role in european foreign policy instead , she argues , europe and the us must first acknowledge the limits of europe 's structural setup and then come to grips with it and make the best out of it .
progress , not perfection while being far from perfect , the lisbon treaty and with it the new external action service still has the potential to enhance europe 's role in the world , argue experts .
it just , wo n't happen overnight , says michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies .
" i think it 's perfectly understandable that the setting up of the external action service takes a year to complete like every complex corporate merger takes time to be sorted out . "
to underscore that the lisbon treaty has indeed changed the thinking within the eu emerson tells an anecdote that happened two weeks ago .
" chancellor merkel and president medvedev said how about having a european-russian security council between lavrov and ashton , just the two of them together . "
the idea of an eu-russian security council with only ashton instead of the all the various defense ministers representing the eu was well-received , adds emerson . " and even more interesting is the idea that is beginning to float around in european circles to make it a trilateral meeting with hillary clinton as well .
all of that could prove a really quite interesting and positive innovation as an example of how these new structures can lead to innovations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants europe to play a more active global role so if europeans and americans let go of the notion that europe will ever speak with one voice and that it can remodel its decision-making process from that of a union of countries to a nation state , progress is possible , says nicolaidis .
she considers the lisbon treaty simply as a shell .
an important one , but still only a shell , that must be filled .
" we europeans need to organize ourselves in such a way that our diversity really becomes a strength , " says nicolaïdis .
" and i would be the first one to admit that this is not the case now . "

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .

uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .

it tips the power balance in the upper house of parliament in berlin . nearly two months after a general election in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , the social democrats and the green party have sealed their coalition agreement to form a minority government .
hannelore kraft , head of the social democrats in the state , is expected to be elected as premier next week .
this will make her the first woman to hold the post in germany 's most populous state .
following the election , the social democrats and the greens are just one seat short of an absolute majority in the state assembly in dusseldorf .
coalition talks with the christian democrats and the free democrats failed .
the minority coalition in north rhine-westphalia will alter the political balance in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , making life more difficult for chancellor angela merkel 's government in berlin .
until now , merkel 's center-right coalition has held the majority both in parliament and in the upper house .
but the new government in north rhine-westphalia means that any bill that needs to pass the bundesrat will require approval from the center-left opposition .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .
uruguay faces the loser of the germany-spain game in the match for third place in the tournament on saturday .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .
the aim of this campaign is to get suggestions from people on the government 's proposed national reconciliation plan .
sensible suggestions will be incorporated in the government 's ' national reform ' blueprint that it plans to present to the public by january next year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

but the hope in washington that the lisbon treaty would lead to a coherent eu foreign policy has n't yet been fulfilled . the pleas coming out of the us , urging europe to act as an effective global player alongside washington are legendary .
for decades , us administrations - both democratic or republican - have been complaining that the economic giant that is europe punches way below its weight in world politics .
and they have been cajoling the europeans incessantly to engage in burden-sharing and get their act together .
of course nothing changed substantially - until the lisbon treaty came around and with it the chance for a serious overhaul of europe 's decision-making process in the foreign policy arena .
but then europe 's leaders , as a first step of implementing the treaty , opted not for two well-known and widely respected veterans to become president and top diplomat for the new eu .
instead they chose in herman van rompuy and catherine ashton a duo to act as the new figureheads for the eu who most europeans had never heard of before they were nominated .
to be sure , both had previous political experience and until now have done a good enough job .
but the message conveyed by this personnel selection clearly was n't one of revolutionary change coming to and from brussels . what 's more , internal strains and divisions even surfaced in the economic sphere , the one area where the eu is considered a global heavyweight .
protracted public squabbling over the response to greece 's financial collapse had not only negative consequences for international markets , but further damaged the eu 's image as a global actor .
constructive poliphony so what will it take for europe to have a foreign policy cast from the same mold ?
" the bad news is that , in that sense the europeans will never get their act together , " kalypso nicolaidis , professor of international relations at oxford university , told deutsche welle .
nicolaidis was part of the so-called eu reflection group chaired by former spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez that delivered its report on the future of the eu to president rompuy in may .
" europeans will always be about poliphony and in their bad days even cacophony , " says nicolaidis .
" and to me europeans as well as americans need to understand that the goal should be that this is a constructive poliphony , a poliphony that makes sense . "
she believes if we continue to judge europe based on its ability to speak with one voice , we are bound to be disappointed .
because that wo n't ever happen , predicts nicolaidis .
bildunterschrift : eu heads of state will continue to play a role in european foreign policy instead , she argues , europe and the us must first acknowledge the limits of europe 's structural setup and then come to grips with it and make the best out of it .
progress , not perfection while being far from perfect , the lisbon treaty and with it the new external action service still has the potential to enhance europe 's role in the world , argue experts .
it just , wo n't happen overnight , says michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies .
" i think it 's perfectly understandable that the setting up of the external action service takes a year to complete like every complex corporate merger takes time to be sorted out . "
to underscore that the lisbon treaty has indeed changed the thinking within the eu emerson tells an anecdote that happened two weeks ago .
" chancellor merkel and president medvedev said how about having a european-russian security council between lavrov and ashton , just the two of them together . "
the idea of an eu-russian security council with only ashton instead of the all the various defense ministers representing the eu was well-received , adds emerson . " and even more interesting is the idea that is beginning to float around in european circles to make it a trilateral meeting with hillary clinton as well .
all of that could prove a really quite interesting and positive innovation as an example of how these new structures can lead to innovations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants europe to play a more active global role so if europeans and americans let go of the notion that europe will ever speak with one voice and that it can remodel its decision-making process from that of a union of countries to a nation state , progress is possible , says nicolaidis .
she considers the lisbon treaty simply as a shell .
an important one , but still only a shell , that must be filled .
" we europeans need to organize ourselves in such a way that our diversity really becomes a strength , " says nicolaïdis .
" and i would be the first one to admit that this is not the case now . "

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

but the hope in washington that the lisbon treaty would lead to a coherent eu foreign policy has n't yet been fulfilled . the pleas coming out of the us , urging europe to act as an effective global player alongside washington are legendary .
for decades , us administrations - both democratic or republican - have been complaining that the economic giant that is europe punches way below its weight in world politics .
and they have been cajoling the europeans incessantly to engage in burden-sharing and get their act together .
of course nothing changed substantially - until the lisbon treaty came around and with it the chance for a serious overhaul of europe 's decision-making process in the foreign policy arena .
but then europe 's leaders , as a first step of implementing the treaty , opted not for two well-known and widely respected veterans to become president and top diplomat for the new eu .
instead they chose in herman van rompuy and catherine ashton a duo to act as the new figureheads for the eu who most europeans had never heard of before they were nominated .
to be sure , both had previous political experience and until now have done a good enough job .
but the message conveyed by this personnel selection clearly was n't one of revolutionary change coming to and from brussels . what 's more , internal strains and divisions even surfaced in the economic sphere , the one area where the eu is considered a global heavyweight .
protracted public squabbling over the response to greece 's financial collapse had not only negative consequences for international markets , but further damaged the eu 's image as a global actor .
constructive poliphony so what will it take for europe to have a foreign policy cast from the same mold ?
" the bad news is that , in that sense the europeans will never get their act together , " kalypso nicolaidis , professor of international relations at oxford university , told deutsche welle .
nicolaidis was part of the so-called eu reflection group chaired by former spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez that delivered its report on the future of the eu to president rompuy in may .
" europeans will always be about poliphony and in their bad days even cacophony , " says nicolaidis .
" and to me europeans as well as americans need to understand that the goal should be that this is a constructive poliphony , a poliphony that makes sense . "
she believes if we continue to judge europe based on its ability to speak with one voice , we are bound to be disappointed .
because that wo n't ever happen , predicts nicolaidis .
bildunterschrift : eu heads of state will continue to play a role in european foreign policy instead , she argues , europe and the us must first acknowledge the limits of europe 's structural setup and then come to grips with it and make the best out of it .
progress , not perfection while being far from perfect , the lisbon treaty and with it the new external action service still has the potential to enhance europe 's role in the world , argue experts .
it just , wo n't happen overnight , says michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies .
" i think it 's perfectly understandable that the setting up of the external action service takes a year to complete like every complex corporate merger takes time to be sorted out . "
to underscore that the lisbon treaty has indeed changed the thinking within the eu emerson tells an anecdote that happened two weeks ago .
" chancellor merkel and president medvedev said how about having a european-russian security council between lavrov and ashton , just the two of them together . "
the idea of an eu-russian security council with only ashton instead of the all the various defense ministers representing the eu was well-received , adds emerson . " and even more interesting is the idea that is beginning to float around in european circles to make it a trilateral meeting with hillary clinton as well .
all of that could prove a really quite interesting and positive innovation as an example of how these new structures can lead to innovations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants europe to play a more active global role so if europeans and americans let go of the notion that europe will ever speak with one voice and that it can remodel its decision-making process from that of a union of countries to a nation state , progress is possible , says nicolaidis .
she considers the lisbon treaty simply as a shell .
an important one , but still only a shell , that must be filled .
" we europeans need to organize ourselves in such a way that our diversity really becomes a strength , " says nicolaïdis .
" and i would be the first one to admit that this is not the case now . "

of course nothing changed substantially - until the lisbon treaty came around and with it the chance for a serious overhaul of europe 's decision-making process in the foreign policy arena .
but then europe 's leaders , as a first step of implementing the treaty , opted not for two well-known and widely respected veterans to become president and top diplomat for the new eu .
instead they chose in herman van rompuy and catherine ashton a duo to act as the new figureheads for the eu who most europeans had never heard of before they were nominated .
to be sure , both had previous political experience and until now have done a good enough job .
but the message conveyed by this personnel selection clearly was n't one of revolutionary change coming to and from brussels . what 's more , internal strains and divisions even surfaced in the economic sphere , the one area where the eu is considered a global heavyweight .
protracted public squabbling over the response to greece 's financial collapse had not only negative consequences for international markets , but further damaged the eu 's image as a global actor .
constructive poliphony so what will it take for europe to have a foreign policy cast from the same mold ?
" the bad news is that , in that sense the europeans will never get their act together , " kalypso nicolaidis , professor of international relations at oxford university , told deutsche welle .
nicolaidis was part of the so-called eu reflection group chaired by former spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez that delivered its report on the future of the eu to president rompuy in may .
" europeans will always be about poliphony and in their bad days even cacophony , " says nicolaidis .
" and to me europeans as well as americans need to understand that the goal should be that this is a constructive poliphony , a poliphony that makes sense . "
she believes if we continue to judge europe based on its ability to speak with one voice , we are bound to be disappointed .
because that wo n't ever happen , predicts nicolaidis .
bildunterschrift : eu heads of state will continue to play a role in european foreign policy instead , she argues , europe and the us must first acknowledge the limits of europe 's structural setup and then come to grips with it and make the best out of it .
progress , not perfection while being far from perfect , the lisbon treaty and with it the new external action service still has the potential to enhance europe 's role in the world , argue experts .
it just , wo n't happen overnight , says michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies .
" i think it 's perfectly understandable that the setting up of the external action service takes a year to complete like every complex corporate merger takes time to be sorted out . "
to underscore that the lisbon treaty has indeed changed the thinking within the eu emerson tells an anecdote that happened two weeks ago .
" chancellor merkel and president medvedev said how about having a european-russian security council between lavrov and ashton , just the two of them together . "
the idea of an eu-russian security council with only ashton instead of the all the various defense ministers representing the eu was well-received , adds emerson . " and even more interesting is the idea that is beginning to float around in european circles to make it a trilateral meeting with hillary clinton as well .
all of that could prove a really quite interesting and positive innovation as an example of how these new structures can lead to innovations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants europe to play a more active global role so if europeans and americans let go of the notion that europe will ever speak with one voice and that it can remodel its decision-making process from that of a union of countries to a nation state , progress is possible , says nicolaidis .
she considers the lisbon treaty simply as a shell .
an important one , but still only a shell , that must be filled .
" we europeans need to organize ourselves in such a way that our diversity really becomes a strength , " says nicolaïdis .
" and i would be the first one to admit that this is not the case now . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .

that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .
uruguay faces the loser of the germany-spain game in the match for third place in the tournament on saturday .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .

uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .
uruguay faces the loser of the germany-spain game in the match for third place in the tournament on saturday .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .

van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .
uruguay faces the loser of the germany-spain game in the match for third place in the tournament on saturday .

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .

their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 06.07.2010 court gives doctors right to pre-select embryos for implantation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a perfect embryo ?
germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

it tips the power balance in the upper house of parliament in berlin . nearly two months after a general election in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , the social democrats and the green party have sealed their coalition agreement to form a minority government .
hannelore kraft , head of the social democrats in the state , is expected to be elected as premier next week .
this will make her the first woman to hold the post in germany 's most populous state .
following the election , the social democrats and the greens are just one seat short of an absolute majority in the state assembly in dusseldorf .
coalition talks with the christian democrats and the free democrats failed .
the minority coalition in north rhine-westphalia will alter the political balance in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , making life more difficult for chancellor angela merkel 's government in berlin .
until now , merkel 's center-right coalition has held the majority both in parliament and in the upper house .
but the new government in north rhine-westphalia means that any bill that needs to pass the bundesrat will require approval from the center-left opposition .

it tips the power balance in the upper house of parliament in berlin . nearly two months after a general election in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , the social democrats and the green party have sealed their coalition agreement to form a minority government .
hannelore kraft , head of the social democrats in the state , is expected to be elected as premier next week .
this will make her the first woman to hold the post in germany 's most populous state .
following the election , the social democrats and the greens are just one seat short of an absolute majority in the state assembly in dusseldorf .
coalition talks with the christian democrats and the free democrats failed .
the minority coalition in north rhine-westphalia will alter the political balance in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , making life more difficult for chancellor angela merkel 's government in berlin .
until now , merkel 's center-right coalition has held the majority both in parliament and in the upper house .
but the new government in north rhine-westphalia means that any bill that needs to pass the bundesrat will require approval from the center-left opposition .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .

the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .

but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .
the aim of this campaign is to get suggestions from people on the government 's proposed national reconciliation plan .
sensible suggestions will be incorporated in the government 's ' national reform ' blueprint that it plans to present to the public by january next year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .

at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .

" we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .
the aim of this campaign is to get suggestions from people on the government 's proposed national reconciliation plan .
sensible suggestions will be incorporated in the government 's ' national reform ' blueprint that it plans to present to the public by january next year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .

whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .

the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .

ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .

" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "

fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .

if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .

today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 06.07.2010 court gives doctors right to pre-select embryos for implantation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a perfect embryo ?
germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 06.07.2010 court gives doctors right to pre-select embryos for implantation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a perfect embryo ?
germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .
the aim of this campaign is to get suggestions from people on the government 's proposed national reconciliation plan .
sensible suggestions will be incorporated in the government 's ' national reform ' blueprint that it plans to present to the public by january next year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .

uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .

" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .
the aim of this campaign is to get suggestions from people on the government 's proposed national reconciliation plan .
sensible suggestions will be incorporated in the government 's ' national reform ' blueprint that it plans to present to the public by january next year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .

that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .

" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .

van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .

the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .

according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "

in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

in nearly one third of the country , including the capital bangkok , a number of restrictions will remain in force for another three months . the state of emergency was imposed in april across thailand including the capital bangkok after mass opposition protests .
the decree puts a ban on public gatherings and gives the security forces special powers including the right to detain suspects for 30 days without charge . on tuesday , the government lifted the emergency in just five provinces , which it thinks are relatively stable .
the rest , especially those in the northeast , the stronghold of the red shirt protestors , will remain under close surveillance for at least another three months . " i think the thai government wants to buy time in a way to pacify the country , " says marco buente , an expert at the institute of asian studies in hamburg .
" on the one hand to prevent new protests from taking place and on the other hand use this time also to speed up the reconciliation process . " bildunterschrift : red shirts during their protests in bangkok in may reassurances to the international community thousands of demonstrators , mostly from rural areas , gathered in the capital 's main commercial centre in april and may to protest against the present government , claiming it was illegitimate and lacked popular mandate .
they demanded fresh elections .
their negotiations with the government failed and the nine weeks of protests took a deadly turn when protestors and security forces clashed .
at least ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 were injured in the chaos that revealed the deep divisions in the country on the issue . the unrest sparked widespread international concern , prompting many countries to issue travel advisories to their citizens . now as thailand gradually returns to stability , the bangkok government has been trying to reassure the international community that it is committed to strengthen democracy .
on monday thai foreign minister kasit piromya met his german counterpart guido westerwelle in berlin . " i have come to reassure my german colleagues of our firm intention and determination to push democracy forward , to push the rules of law , to have good governance and transparency and to move quickly towards the national reconciliation to reform the social , the economic and the political regimes of thailand , " said kasit , while addressing a joint press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle with his counterpart kasit piromya in berlin five point plan he informed the german foreign minister about the five point plan for national reconciliation that his government thinks is necessary to bring stability to the country .
the plan envisages far-reaching reforms to address issues such as social injustice and constitutional amendments and also includes the establishment of a fact-finding commission to look into the violence last may . " we hope that the recommendation would be submitted to the people , to the parliament towards the end of this year and hopefully the people can go to a referendum to decide and to approve a new constitution or a set of amendments to the constitution so that the existing parliament could be dissolved , and a new election could be held and hopefully we will have a new elected government in thailand by early spring , " said kasit . for his part , guido westerwelle said that the german government and people were very concerned about the thai crisis and that they were optimistic about the thai government 's reconciliation plan .
" germany supports the thai government on its path to a lasting solution to the crisis , " he said .
" the five-point plan presented by the prime minister is a good basis . " in a bid to gauge the public mood , the thai government has also launched a hotline .
the aim of this campaign is to get suggestions from people on the government 's proposed national reconciliation plan .
sensible suggestions will be incorporated in the government 's ' national reform ' blueprint that it plans to present to the public by january next year . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .

woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .

" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l 'oreal heiress bettencourt is one of the richest women in the world she also accused sarkozy of personally accepting cash contributions from bettencourt at the l 'oreal heiress 's home while he was mayor of the paris suburb neuilly .
sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 06.07.2010 court gives doctors right to pre-select embryos for implantation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a perfect embryo ?
germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

however , few other viable options satisfy the needs of both sides . two states for two people in the middle east .
this is the objective of the so-called oslo peace process .
the intention at the heart of this process is that the areas currently occupied by israel in the west bank and in the gaza strip will one day form a palestinian state which will live in peace beside its neighbor israel .
however , the possibility of this intention becoming a reality seems ever decreasing .
while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu commits to the two-state solution in his rhetoric , at the same time he allows a situation to develop in the occupied territories which makes this solution impossible , explains german political scientist helga baumgarten .
despite netanyahu 's order freezing the construction by jewish settlers in the occupied territories , the settlements are continuously being developed .
as the official end to the 10-month freeze approaches , there has been a speeding up of israeli construction activity in the occupied areas adding to the many new projects which have been developed in the last few months .
the construction of the road system connecting the settlements with the heartland of israel has also been fast-tracked .
however , this road system is for the use of settlers only .
the palestinians are not permitted to use it .
as a result , with the help of foreign support , the palestinians are building their own alternative road system .
and that , according to baumgarten , means that the autonomous palestinian authority is forced to accept the israeli occupation of the west bank .
israel 's policies focused on removing palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's plans for jerusalem crush palestinian hopes baumgarten is an expert on such matters .
for many years she has lived in east jerusalem and teaches at the birzeit university near ramallah .
she has seen the effects of the israeli expansionist and settlement policy with her own eyes .
in no other place is the israeli expansionist policy more clear than in east jerusalem where the palestinians see the capital of their future state .
" they are trying to get jerusalem under complete israeli control and to push the palestinians out of the town , " says baumgarten .
this is also the case in the west bank where israel is attempting to get as much land as possible under its control .
unofficially it is hoped that the palestinians find themselves under so much pressure and have to live in such difficult conditions that they have no other choice but to leave . "
about 500,000 jewish colonists currently live in the occupied areas .
their towns , villages and farms cut through the west bank and prevent the possibility of a coherent palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital from being created .
the two-state solution championed by many international powers , including germany , is no longer a viable option .
" there is no political will in israel to remove the occupied areas , " says the israeli historian tamar amar-dahl .
she stresses that neither president shimon peres , nor prime minister benjamin netanyahu nor even secretary of defence ehud barak are ready to renounce the west bank .
alternatives hampered by self-interest and fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living together in one state seems an impossible situation amar-dahl , who teaches at berlin 's humboldt university , has just published a biography of peres , the 87-year-old president of israel who is regarded as an architect of the oslo peace process for which he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
in reality , she says , peres is an opponent of the two-state solution .
" peres has been fighting against the two-state solution for many years , " she said .
" he is actually very fearful of a palestinian state being created in the occupied areas so he has tried to develop alternatives . "
however , these alternatives give no answer as to what should happen with the palestinians and in which state they should be given their full rights .
could a bi-national state in which both people live together equally be a solution ?
amar-dahl says no .
this draft has been on the table for 30 years now but it has no chance of success as it contradicts the view of the jewish and democratic state which most israelis want .
the bi-national state solution also gives the palestinians equal rights , which goes against what the zionists in israel want .
helga baumgarten also says that the bi-national solution would make the jews the minority in the land as evidence collected over the last 10 years has shown that the palestinians are already the majority in the area between the mediterranean sea and jordan .
only the two-state solution could guarantee the continuity of the jewish state in the middle east .
" in the long term , these are the options ; settlements and occupation or a state in which jewish israelis will sooner or later be a minority , " says baumgarten .
" only the foundation of a palestinian state in the west bank and in gaza could prevent this . "
but the belief and hope of ever getting their own state is also dying among the palestinian general public .
in contrast , the one-state , bi-national solution is winning more supporters , at least among intellectuals .
after 43 years of occupation , many palestinians see no other way to finally get the rights they have been denied for so long .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .
strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "
legal mismatch yet for all that , she and many others besides feel there is something skewed about the way germany handles pre-implantation genetic diagnosis versus prenatal diagnosis -lrb- pnd -rrb- .
twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late-stage terminations are not easy for women lawmakers account for the discrepancy in saying that the woman 's health must be taken into account , and to learn 12 weeks into a pregnancy that the child she is carrying will be born with genetic defects , can , they say , cause mental stress .
but so , argues bartley , can aborting at such a late stage .
patients can not be prepared for late-stage termination and it can have a desperately traumatizing effect .
" it creates conflicts that would be totally unavoidable , " she concluded .

strict rules germany has long said the practice of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , which sees the genome of one or two cells of a several-day-old embryo tested for certain abnormalities , is only allowed in exceptional circumstances .
these include couples deemed at high risk of having a child with a severe genetic condition , embryos with chromosomal disorders that suggest they would not reach the stage of extra-uterine viability , and women who , despite repeated fertility treatment , have not managed to conceive .
a position the high court upheld in the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right to life no matter what for everyone else , the strict guidelines of the embryo protection act rule pre-implantation scientific screening right out of the picture .
it is a hugely controversial issue and opinions divide as easily as the cells they debate .
proponents of the law say the clue is in the law 's name and every embryo has the same right to life as the next one .
in an interview with the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , medical ethicist giovanni maio said that to pre-select is to renounce the unconditional acceptance of every human being .
" i think it is wrong to say that because a life is sick it should not be , " maio said .
" the danger is that we strong ones say that lives we consider to be less valuable should not be , but we should n't sit in judgment on the value of another life . "
automatic selection on the other side of the fence , critics argue that the current restrictions are fundamentally flawed .
dr. julia bartley , consultant in reproductive medicine at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that even without pgd , fertility doctors automatically practice selection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even from just looking at embryos , doctors can tell a certain amount " we fertilize as many eggs as there are and we let them grow , then after three days we check them to see if they look good or not , " bartley said , adding that they quite logically choose the ones that look most healthy .
it would only be one step further to check what the eye ca n't see with genetic testing .
and given that more embryos are likely to die than survive , why does german stand so firm on the issue ?
bartley believes the root is embedded in the country 's darkest chapter of history .
" it is because of euthanasia during the nazi era , " she said , referring to the systematic killing of those with disabilities .
" what happened back then has left us with a special responsibility . "

twelve weeks into pregnancy , women are at liberty to request a chromosome analysis test , and many do .
if at that time abnormalities show up , the mothers-to-be can legally terminate their pregnancies .
and again , some do .
" what we have is a schizophrenic situation where we can not do a pgd but where the mother can abort the fetus if it is handicapped in one way or another , " bartley said , adding that that is not ethically correct .

germany 's high court has ruled that doctors are allowed to pre-select healthy embryos for their patients .
but the decision has re-ignited a moral debate about ethics and a woman 's right to choose . it was an unusual story which began when a 47-year-old fertility doctor , who was treating three couples with family histories of congenital illness , ran some tests to establish whether the embryos he had fertilized bore signs of hereditary defects .
some did .
he revealed his findings to his patients who turned down his offer to have the imperfect embryos implanted in their wombs .
the healthy ones were transferred while the others were left to die .
uncertain about the legality of his own actions , the medic subsequently reported himself to the relevant authorities and a court hearing in the german capital ensued .
in may of 2009 , he was given six months on probation and sent on his way .
on tuesday , the controversial issue came up in front of the federal court of justice in leipzig , and it too ruled in the doctor 's favor .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

german fans will be hoping this is paul the octopus ' first wrong prediction . with a 100 percent record in the 2010 world cup so far , paul the octopus has a perfect track record at predicting the outcome of germany 's games .
housed at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , paul has correctly predicted the four german wins and even the surprise group stage loss to serbia .
on tuesday , paul was once again given the choice of picking food from two different plastic containers lowered into his tank - one decorated with a spanish flag and one with a german flag .
the container which paul opens first is seen as his prediction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul has wrongly predicted germany vs. spain before paul initially went for the container marked " spain " before moving around the tank and hovering over the german box .
but he quickly headed back to the ' spaniards ' and selected the food from that box .
his selection has been met with groans of discomfort from german football fans .
although his record has been faultless in the 2010 world cup , paul has been wrong before .
in the european championships in 2008 , he had an 80 percent record , only getting one match wrong .
that time , he plumped for germany to beat spain in the final .

uruguay faces the loser of that game for third place . the netherlands have advanced to their third world cup final after beating uruguay in 3-2 in the first semifinal of the world cup .
the two teams went into the locker rooms tied at 1-1 and played back and forth for the first 20 minutes of the second half .
in the 70th minute , the netherlands ' wesley sneijder took a pass at the top of the penalty area and snaked a shot through uruguay 's defense to put the dutch up 2-1 .
minutes later , bayern munich 's arjen robben put the game out of reach for uruguay with a strong header on a cross from dirk kuyt .
just before the final whistle , uruguay pulled one back after a free kick pass to maximiliano pereira , who took a few short dribbles and curled in a low strike for the goal .
first half goals from distance giovanni van bronckhorst opened the scoring for the netherlands in the 18th minute with what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bronckhorst , center , fired away from nearly 40 meters the netherlands were still getting a feel for uruguay 's defense in the first 15 minutes of the game , having a few good looks at the goal but not seeing any real chances .
van bronckhorst took a pass from 38 meters -lrb- 41 yards -rrb- out , and rather than dribble the ball in or make another pass , the dutchman simply wound up and launched a perfect strike into the top right corner .
uruguay keeper nestor muslera got a finger on the ball , but it played no role as it was n't enough to keep the ball from its destination - the inside of the top of the post .
uruguay 's first goal also came from a long shot that came as a surprise .
the south americans ' offense began to come alive as the first half wore on , and their persistence paid off in the 41st minute as diego forlan , wearing the captain 's armband in place of the suspended diego lugano , evened the score at 1-1 with a shot from 26 meters .
the netherlands , who have now won all six of their games in the tournament , will face the winner of tomorrow 's semifinal between germany and spain .
it is the first final for the netherlands since 1978 , when they lost to then-tournament hosts argentina .
uruguay faces the loser of the germany-spain game in the match for third place in the tournament on saturday .

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

in its ruling the court said the practice could prevent genetic defects from being passed on . germany 's highest criminal court has ruled legal pre-implantation diagnosis through the scanning of embryos for possible defects .
the federal court of justice in leipzig on tuesday handed down its verdict in a case of a berlin doctor who had come forward and admitted that he had carried out the procedure .
he said he had done so in an effort to get the issue legally clarified .
pre-implantation diagnosis is a practice in which a couple 's egg cells and sperm are used to create a number of embryos in a laboratory .
these are then scanned for possible genetic defects so that a healthy one can be chosen and be implanted in the mother .
the other embryos die .
germany 's embryo protection law , however , states that embryos can only be artificially created if they are to be used for pregnancy .
the berlin gynecologist had carried out the procedure for a couple worried about genetic defects or inherited diseases .
the male partner had a gene defect that meant there was a high chance that the baby would be born with down syndrome .
in may 2009 a berlin court cleared the doctor of breaching embryo protection laws , ruling that the wording of the embryo protection law did not prohibit pre-implantation diagnosis but the berlin state prosecutor appealed the verdict , and the question then went to the federal court .
up to now , germany remained one of the few countries where pre-implantation diagnosis was regulated and many german couples went abroad to ensure they have a healthy baby .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .

will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

sarkozy says the accusations are part of a smear campaign . a media report that liliane bettencourt , one of the world 's richest women and the l 'oreal heiress , illegally contributed 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 189,000 -rrb- to the campaign fund of french president nicolas sarkozy has unleashed a stream of denials in paris .
the online news outlet mediapart ran a story quoting a woman referred to as claire t. , who said she was asked to withdraw 150,000 euros as bettencourt 's bookkeeper .
the money was meant to be given to sarkozy 's 2007 election campaign in cash through his campaign treasurer at the time , eric woerth .
in france , political contributions are limited to 7,500 euros per person per year , and only 150 euros may be in cash .
never touched an illegal euro woerth , who is france 's current labor minister , has denied that he accepted illegal money from bettencourt or any other source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is said to have taken illegal campaign cash " i have never touched a euro , and my party has never touched a euro , that was not legal , " he told television station itele .
" everything is clear and clean . "
woerth added that he had no plans to resign over the scandal .
this is not the first time that woerth has come under fire for his connection to bettencourt .
woeth 's wife , florence , was until recently employed by the wealth management company that bettencourt uses .
before she stepped down , woerth was asked to resign from his post as labor minister due to a conflict of interest .
woerth has also been accused of helping bettencourt avoid tax evasion charges .
l 'oreal cash claire t. 's lawyer , antoine gillot , confirmed that his client had made a statement to police regarding the alleged illegal contributions .
bettencourt 's former bookkeeper said she did not personally deliver the money to woerth , but that it was delivered by bettencourt 's wealth manager at the time .

sarkozy flatly denied the accusations at a round-table on public health on tuesday .
" i would love it so much if the country could excite itself over the big problems -lsb- such as health -rsb- , " he said " rather than to get wrapped up in the first horror , a slander with only one goal , to smear with no basis in reality . "
france 's prime minister francios fillon has also weighed in on the issue , calling the accusations a " manhunt " at a press conference at the european parliament in strasbourg .
the scandal has led to calls for sarkozy to push ahead planned restructuring measures in his cabinet as part of an effort to sweep out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.07.2010 finland 's new right to broadband may come slower to rest of eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : broadband in every home could put internet cafes out of business other member states have paid lip service to the idea of giving their citizenry universal access to the internet , but none seem to be willing to implement it into law anytime soon .
will finland 's move change that ? last week , finland 's new law of making relatively low-cost internet access a basic right went into effect .
that means all of finland - even though the overwhelming majority of finns are online already - will have a minimum of one megabit per second available at a " reasonable cost " of 30 to 40 euros -lrb- $ 37 to $ 50 -rrb- per month .
this speed requirement is expected to go up to 100 megabits per second by 2015 .
however , many other european union countries are hoping to follow suit .
sweden , along with the united kingdom , france and spain are among several that have pledged in general to get their populations online , but have done little to make it happen .
european politicans call for more access christian engstrom , a swedish member of the european parliament hopes his home country moves quickly to catch up to its scandinavian neighbor .
" it 's an admission that the internet is an important part of society , it 's not just a toy for the kids , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's a fundamental part of infrastructure .
and i think that signal is a very important one . "
engstrom himself is a computer programmer and member of sweden 's pirate party , a young , tech-savvy group that won its two seats in june 2009 .
but it 's more than just digerati politicians who are calling for more broadband access .
belgium , germany are farthest behind in march 2010 , analysys mason , a british consulting firm , released a study on the state of competition in the european telecoms sector .
the european competitive telecoms authority -lrb- ecta -rrb- used that study to suggest that european governments are hurting themselves by not embracing the digital world more wholeheartedly and rapidly .
the study showed that improving broadband access throughout the european union would provide 1.1 million new jobs and a gdp increase of 850 billion euros by 2015 .
however , according to ilsa godlovitch , ecta 's director , one of the big holdups is that governments must end the traditional monopolies of telecom markets .
she said scandinavia once again leads the way in this area , but that the united kingdom and france have also encouraged more competition in their telecom markets , ending up with more choice and lower prices for consumers .
glaring examples of where this is n't happening are belgium and germany .
" it is an important objective for everybody to have broadband access , more important than to protect a national champion like deutsche telekom , " she said .
" we really do hope the german government will look at the success of broadband in the scandinavian countries , for example , and will pursue a more open approach in the future rather than protecting the interests of the national incumbent . "
internet users skeptical jacqueline santos , a brussels internet cafe user agrees .
she pointed out that if the european union actually made good on some of these promises to get low-cost internet access for everyone , then she would n't be at the internet cafe , spending one euro per hour to get online .
" you ca n't live without if you want to be well informed , " she said .

injured captain michael ballack has left south africa , apparently in a battle of wills with his replacement , philip lahm .
lahm has made it clear that he would like to continue to wear the armband after the world cup but ballack , 33 , also intends to work his way back into joachim loew 's team , presumably as captain .
" this whole discussion is unnecessary , " oliver bierhoff , the primarily administrative ' manager ' of the german national team told reporters in south africa .
" at the end of the day , this topic is of zero importance this week .
the issue can be addressed later , and then it will be for the coach -lrb- joachim loew -rrb- to decide . "
whether the discussion is necessary or not , it is certainly prevalent in the german press , and with germany playing such good soccer without ballack , few pundits seem to be taking his side .
" philip lahm is now in a good position , because he is a very smooth captain , he has everything under control , and he 's very popular with his teammates , " the deputy editor of sportbild magazine , armin grassmuck , told deutsche welle .
" michael ballack was at no point a very good or accepted captain , because he was the big star in the team , and he had an attitude to go with this status , " grassmuck said .
grassmuck says he doubts that many of ballack 's teammates will have shed a tear after his departure from south africa .
end of an era ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ankle ligament injury sidelined ballack in may ballack has played an impressive 98 games for germany , and before the tournament , his injury was widely considered a major setback for the team .
the veteran midfielder has made it clear that he wants to keep his place in the national side until euro 2012 .
" if he comes back , he 'd have a new role in the team , " grassmuck said .
" if he accepts the new role he could play until 2012 , but if he wants to keep his position as captain and as the main player in the team it could be very , very difficult for him . "
even international football writers suggested before the world cup that the absence of the veteran captain could be a blessing in disguise , allowing germany 's younger stars to shine , and forcing them to take on greater responsibility .
" certainly , bastian schweinsteiger has stepped up to the mark spectacularly well and obviously lahm is a great captain too , " british football journalist from fourfourtwo magazine , gary parkinson told deutsche welle .
" ballack has had his spats with other members of the team in the past , and there was the feeling that it would become a more balanced , harmonious squad without him .
so , in a way it 's no surprise to hear that there are rumors of squad discontent surrounding ballack . "
meanwhile , there 's a growing chorus of germans calling for ballack to settle the dispute himself .
" michael would prove what a classy guy he is , " said former german captain lothar matthaeus , " if he were to say : ' the team is strong enough without me .
i 'm going to step down and concentrate on leverkusen . " '
ballack 's coming home bildunterschrift : ballack 's no stranger to leverkusen , but it 's been a while since he wore the shirt putting the national team aside , michael ballack 's next challenge is to establish himself at his new club bayer leverkusen next season .
ballack spent three years at leverkusen earlier in his career , and is returning to the club on a free transfer from a four-year stint with chelsea , one of the giants of england 's premiership .
chelsea , a team that is fighting to reign in its runaway budget after years of check-book management , decided not to extend his four-year tenure , even though ballack was still a mainstay in the midfield .
gary parkinson says he thinks chelsea disposed of ballack 's services for financial reasons , with the player rumoured to have been earning roughly 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 188,000 -rrb- per week at the london club .
" if he were to have signed another contract it would amost certainly have been at the same rate or even higher , and he probably would n't have wanted a one year contract .
i ca n't even do the math , but that 's a lot of money !
that 's several million pounds for somebody who could start to have injury problems , " parkinson said .
however , while the move to leverkusen is a step down , it by no means signals the end of ballack 's club career .
he 's joining a dynamic , talented young team , which for much of this past season looked like serious title challengers .
however , they fell to pieces late in the campaign - not for the first time , either - with many pundits pointing to a lack of experienced leadership as the side 's ultimate downfall .
" at leverkusen ballack 's in a really good position , " sportbild 's armin grassmuck said .
" leverkusen is a very young and talented team , and michael ballack - with his experience , his professionalism and his quality - is the perfect man to lead the young players in leverkusen . "
what seems far less certain , however , is whether ballack really remains the perfect man to lead the german national team , even though oliver bierhoff inists that the current situation is really very simple : " philip lahm is world cup captain , and michael ballack is captain . "
for now , at least .

yet they 've been hit hard by climate change , often leading to catastrophic consequences . for centuries , pastoralist communities in the arid ethiopian regions of borana and somali have been roaming with their cattle herds in search of grazing land .
but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

but their traditional way of life is threatened by increasingly severe and frequent droughts and shorter rainy periods that have come to mark changing weather patterns in eastern africa .
in fact , according to a study by aid group care this year , climate change has affected nomads like no other group in the world .
ethiopian shepherds quoted in the study said that earlier , a drought occurred every six to ten years .
but now , they said , it takes place almost yearly .
more frequent droughts mean families have less time to recover and restock herds .
water is scarce and often has to be brought from far away .
the dry cracked ground erodes more easily ; cattle are more susceptible to disease and die , further shrinking the meager income that pastoral tribes rely on .
climate change thus threatens the very survival of nomads .
40 million nomads affected extreme weather fluctuations , droughts , floods , storms , rising temperatures and arid conditions pose a risk to millions of nomads from ethiopia , niger , and mauretania to kenya and sudan .
guenther schlee from the max planck institute for social anthropology in halle -lrb- saale -rrb- , germany estimates that there are around 40 million nomads today in the world .
" in somalia , for instance , the majority of the populations follows this -lsb- nomadic -rsb- economic model , " schlee , one of germany 's most prominent nomad researchers , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weather fluctuations are making life difficult for reindeer herders too but it 's not just the shepherds and pastoralist tribes of africa who are bearing the brunt of the alterations in climate .
mild winters with heavy downpours have also posed major challenges to reindeer herders in northern finland and russia .
grounds , which previously used to regularly freeze , now often turn into swamps with animals and entire herds sinking into the sludge .
the vegetation is changing and it 's become harder to plan routes and time frames for migration because rivers take longer to freeze over or thaw earlier .
mongolian nomads struggle to cope mongolia is another region where climate change has hit hard and is squeezing nomadic lifestyles .
some 2.7 million people - almost hald of the population in the central asian country - make a living from livestock breeding .
climate change has led to extreme weather - from drought in summer to icy winters .
last winter , massive snow fall and temperatures of minus 40 degrees celsius -lrb- minus 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- pushed many nomads into poverty .
the international red cross estimates that some 4.5 million goats , sheep , camels and horses died of the cold , depriving thousands of nomads of their livelihood .
whether it 's in ethiopia , finland or mongolia , nomads need help to adapt to changing climatic conditions .
in mongolia for instance , a number of aid groups have begun projects to build wells and cisterns to boost storage and availability of water in drought-prone regions as well as initiatives to generate electricity from renewable sources .
but experts say that the key task is to try and bring about change in the social and political conditions that nomads are subject to .
" that 's because the problems of nomads certainly do n't have to do with climate change alone , " schlee said .
he added that one-sided polices favoring more settled economic models , population growth and the difficulty in getting grazing land often hits nomads harder than climate change .
bildunterschrift : drought has pushed nomads in kenya into poverty climate wars german social psychologist robert welzer has said that the social consequences of climate change poses " the biggest challenge to modernity . "
in his book , " climate wars , " he lists 70 conflicts around the world that he says threaten to escalate because of climate change .
according to welzer , the civil war in sudan , which involves some 20 militias in addition to government troops , is a conflict between settled farmers and nomadic herders and is the first " climate war . "
but conflicts between nomads and settlers are n't new , they 're as old as humanity .
that 's why , nomad researcher schlee said , climate change certainly does not sound the death knell for nomadic lifestyles .
on the contrary , new technology such as mobile phones can make lives for nomads easer , schlee said .
" actually , there are ever fewer arguments for a settled lifestyle , " schlee said , adding that nomadic lifestyles are increasingly being seen in industrialized countries .
" most companies today are headed by nomads who move from one country to another , from one hotel room to another . "

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "

fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .

in a way , he sees himself as a spiritual counselor as much as an undertaker . it 's sunday , and for undertaker fritz roth just another working day .
but as it happens , this particular funeral service is n't just like any other .
today , he 's burying a close personal friend .
fritz roth is a typically jovial rhinelander .
now 60 , he sees his job as an undertaker as a vocation .
he 's been director of the puetz-roth funeral home in bergisch gladbach for more than 25 years .
at first glance , his funeral home looks like an upmarket country hotel , complete with a neat , well-tended garden .
over the years , fritz has gained a nationwide reputation – not least as the founder of germany 's first private graveyard .
bildunterschrift : " i believe it 's important to maintain a natural approach to dying , death and mourning , " he says .
anyone who talks to him immediately gets a sense of his passion for his work .
his first priority is to help the bereaved deal with their grief .
" i want to encourage people to accept death , " he says .
if fritz roth often sounds like a pastor , that 's because this is how he sees himself , to some extent .
his deeply spiritual approach is no surprise given his background .
when he was ten , fritz roth went to live in a monastery in steyl in the netherlands – lured by promises of a football pitch and a swimming pool .
he spent nine years there .
but even though he has always been willing to give things a try , he could n't bring himself to commit to a lifetime of celibacy .
he left , and went on to study business in cologne .
then his father-in-law introduced him to an old friend who was looking for someone to take over his funeral parlor .
that 's where his story comes full circle – because today , fritz roth is burying his father-in-law , the man who first suggested he become an undertaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth in his funeral parlor " this is a very special day for me , " he says .
" in my sadness , i can experience for myself everything i have ever tried to convey to people about the culture of bereavement . "
fritz roth was born in 1949 on his parents ' farm in eikamp , north rhine westphalia .
he says that being the only boy among four sisters was like " winning the lottery . "
everyone spoilt him rotten , including his grandmother , who died when he was six .
it was a formative experience .
" i was able to hold my dead grandmother 's hand , " he says .
he explains that this allowed him to grasp her death – that it meant she would no longer be there to make him hot chocolate and treats .
although he was so young , he understood the difference between life and death .
today , he has a special interest in how children cope with bereavement .
" they show their feelings , they scream things like ' i want my mummy to stay ' – but then they turn around and ask for an ice-cream , " he marvels .
death was an integral part of his own life while he was growing up .
a further four siblings died at birth .
but he has only happy memories of life as a young boy on a farm , surrounded by chickens , cows and pigs .
" there was such as feeling of safety , " he recalls .
" we would all eat at a big table , then i would climb on to my father 's shoulders and we would all take it in turns to tell stories . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz roth talking to deutsche welle reporter josé ospina-valencia his father was a very cultured man .
fritz roth remembers going on hikes with him , and listening to him tell stories of secret castles and mythical creatures .
" i inherited my imagination and love of art from him , " says roth .
" art is about images , and we can use images to express feelings we ca n't fully understand . "
such as death .
fritz roth feels strongly that contemporary society needs more spirituality .
asked what he means by that , his response is : " take death personally again ! "
then he quotes a few lines by jewish german-language poet mascha kaléko : " before my own death is me do not fear for .
only before the death of those , which are me close .
how am i to live , if they are no longer there ? "

bbc - berkshire - festival security is stepped up / bbc introducing bbc local -pipe- berkshire -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 07:46 gmt , tuesday , 6 july 2010 08:46 uk festival security is stepped up by matthew crist steps are being taken to make reading festival safer this year after the reported troubles in 2009 .
festival organisers are increasing the number of police officers , stewards and security staff on site .
they will also ban alcohol being brought onto the site from 6pm on the sunday night .
and bbc radio berkshire found out why those measures are being put in place and talked to some of those caught up in the troubles .
" it was an incredibly safe festival generally .
everything worked , " said melvin benn of festival republic .
" unfortunately , although we have always had some hi-jinx on the sunday evening , last year that hi-jinks turned nasty , really for the first time , " he says .
" the nastiness has never been there and caught us by surprise . "
intimidated someone who felt the affects of that was charlotte from slough who said she felt intimidated when she attended the festival .
" everything just got really crazy .
i was n't expecting it at all .
all the people just turned into hoodlums and ran around burning tents and stealing stuff from people 's tents .
" it just got really scary , i was only 17 at the time and i 've never experienced anything like that before .
" so we just packed up our tents and stayed awake all night just chatting to the people in the campsite next to us because they had a big campfire which they had cooked their dinner on .
" then they threw all their bags and tents on it , everyone around ran to the fire and threw their aerosol cans on it so when they exploded it was really horrible .
" and someone tried to get my tent and throw it in the fire but it had all my stuff in it and i told them to go away .
" so we put our stuff in our bags and stayed awake until the first train the next morning . "
increased security so reading festival organisers will double the security presence to 400 people .
melvin explained the decision .
" in the past thames valley police have generally resisted making arrests for what they perceived as being hi-jinx .
" they are aware that the people there are at university , or a lot of them are at university , and that hi-jinx to a certain extent would potentially spoil their future life , their future career because they would get a criminal record .
" the police have been really good about that in the past and this year they are very clear and i 'm standing with them on this .
" they will not tolerate it and arrests will be made .
people need to be aware of the consequences of arrests being made and they will be vigorous about our desire to catch people causing trouble and seek prosecutions against them because this is affecting a lot of people .
" based on last year , their misbehaviour stepped beyond hi-jinx and actually should be punished . "
troubles siobhan morse , who has been to the festival six times , also witnessed the troubles at last year 's festival .
" people throw things on fires , " she said .
" they do n't have any consideration for any safety .
" the police try to intervene but then some festival-goers turn on them .
and they are here for your safety but yet you 're preventing them from doing that .
" i think having a presence throughout the festival will halt any idea of them starting trouble and fires , but you know there is only so much you can do .
this year siobhan is just going to the festival , which starts 27 august , 2010 , on the sunday instead of the whole weekend .
" after that i 've had enough , " she said .
" i do n't want to do it anymore .
i 'd rather just go and have fun and be safe . "
alcohol ban festival organisers have come under criticism with some suggesting an alcohol ban on the sunday will not make much of a difference and that festival-goers will just stash alcohol for consumption on the night .
" it 's not necessarily the big issue .
last year it was that an awful lot of the traders on richfield avenue had significant surplus stock of quite cheap cans of beer and were selling them at knock down prices .
" people were buying them because they could buy a case for the same price as four beers .
they could n't drink that amount because it 's just too much volume .
" they ended up using those cans by throwing them .
" that 's the intent there - to minimise the amount of really cheap cans that can be brought on late at night , which subsequently are used as missiles . "
so will this year 's festival be safer than previous years ?
" i can take all reasonable steps to ensure it is safe , " melvin said .
" but i ca n't guarantee absolute safety ; no one can guarantee absolute safety .
" believe me the plans being undertaken are very robust .
they have been worked through with the council , they have been worked through with the police and we are very determined to stamp out the nastiness that occurred last year . "

some details of how this will happen have emerged .
the israeli authorities have moved from a limited list of permitted goods , to a list of specifically prohibited goods and materials that might have military applications .
according to reports , israeli authorities will allow more civilian goods to enter , including all food items , toys , stationery , kitchen utensils , mattresses and towels .
construction materials for civilian projects will be allowed in under international supervision .
the strip was out under a heightened israeli blockade since the militant group hamas seized control in june 2007 .
israel wants to weaken hamas , end rocket attacks from gaza and get back captured soldier gilad shalit .
the blockade has been widely described as " collective punishment " resulting in a humanitarian crisis ; un officials have described the situation as " grim " , " deteriorating " and a " medieval siege " , but israel says there are no shortages in gaza , pointing to the aid it allows in .
overview food fuel electricity sewage and water businesses agriculture construction medical care overview : what gets in for much of the three years since hamas took control of gaza , its 1.5m people have relied on less than a quarter of the volume of imported supplies they received in december 2005 .
in the wake of the hamas takeover , israel said it would allow only basic humanitarian supplies into the strip .
it has a list of dual-use items such as steel pipes and fertiliser which it says could be used to manufacture weapons .
these are not allowed in , with the exception of " special humanitarian cases " .
other than that , no specific list of what is and is not allowed in has been published , and items gaining entry vary over time .
the un relief agency for palestinian refugees unrwa 's list of household items that have been refused entry at various times includes light bulbs , candles , matches , books , musical instruments , crayons , clothing , shoes , mattresses , sheets , blankets , pasta , tea , coffee , chocolate , nuts , shampoo and conditioner .
goods allowed into gaza canned meat and tuna , but not canned fruit mineral water , but not fruit juice sesame paste -lrb- tahini -rrb- but not jam tea and coffee but not chocolate download the full list -lsb- 89.9 kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here details of gaza blockade revealed un impatient as blockade stalls building many other items - ranging from cars to fridges to computers - are generally refused entry .
building materials such as cement , concrete and wood were nearly always refused entry until early 2010 , when some glass , wood , cement and aluminium were allowed in .
during the six month truce between israel and hamas , which began in june 2008 , and in early 2010 , the volume and range of goods increased with trucks of shoes and clothes entering gaza .
israel says hamas has diverted aid in the past , and could appropriate building materials for its own use .
aid agencies say they have stringent monitoring systems in place .
click here to return food aid agencies operating in gaza say they have largely been able to continue to transport basic supplies such as flour and cooking oil into the territory .
but the un 's food and agriculture organisation says 61 % of gazans are " food insecure " .
according to the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , 80 % of gazan households rely on some kind of food aid .
unrwa provides food aid for 750,000 people , half the population .
its food distribution has been suspended several times since june 2007 as a result of border closures or fuel shortages .
israel usually says crossings are closed for security reasons , pointing to occasions when palestinian militants have attacked the crossings or fired barrages of rockets into israel .
unrwa rations provide about two-thirds of dietary needs , and so need to be supplemented by dairy products , meat , fish and fresh fruit and vegetables .
some of these items are grown locally , some allowed in from israel , and some smuggled in through tunnels under the egypt-gaza border .
but with the palestinian bureau of statistics estimating unemployment at 38.6 % in early 2010 , some gazans can not afford the basics , even if they are physically available .
unrwa says the number of gazan that it helps who are unable to buy basic items such as soap , stationary and safe drinking water has tripled since 2007 .
a un survey in 2008 found more than half gaza 's households had sold their disposable assets and were relying on credit to buy food , three-quarters of gazans were buying less food than in the past , and almost all were eating less fresh fruit , vegetables and animal protein to save money .
the israeli military operation in december and january 2009 disrupted food aid transfer and distribution significantly , as well as causing what the un fao estimates at $ 180m of damage to the agricultural sector .
according to the world health organization , one third of children under five and women of childbearing age are anaemic .
click here to return fuel and power in september 2007 , the israeli government declared the strip a " hostile entity " in response to continued rocket attacks on southern israel , and said it would start cutting fuel imports .
at times , petrol and diesel shortages have caused major problems .
donkey carts are a common sight in gaza .
vehicle fuel enters from egypt through the tunnels .
according to information complied by oxfam , no petrol or diesel for vehicles has been allowed in from israel since november 2008 , except for fuel for un cars and five other shipments in three years .
the amount of cooking gas allowed in has generally fluctuated between about a third and a half of requirements , oxfam figures show .
click here to return electricity gaza 's electricity supply is made up of 144mw from israel , 17mw from egypt and the rest from an eu-run power plant in gaza which can generate up to 80mw .
the power plant 's fuel is usually brought in through the main fuel entry point , the nahal oz crossing .
the plant has shut down completely several times after running out of fuel because the crossing was closed .
it was out of fuel for most of the israeli operation in january 2009 , leaving two-thirds of gazans without power at the height of the crisis .
since early 2008 , the power plant has received enough fuel to operate at only about two-thirds of its capacity - in line with an israeli supreme court ruling which set a minimum amount of fuel that israel must allow into gaza .
figures monitored by international agencies show fuel deliveries dropped even below these minimums at several points in the first half of 2008 .
in late 2009 , the responsibility for funding the fuel was transferred from the eu to the ramallah-based palestinian authority - since then the amount of fuel supplied has declined .
in april and may 2010 , fuel supply fluctuated , with the plant able to operate at between 20 and 50 % of its capacity .
power cuts remain frequent .
research by oxfam in april 2010 showed houses across gaza without power for 35-60 hours a week .
click here to return sewage and water the blockade has taken its toll on gaza 's water and sewage network .
lack of spare parts has made repairs difficult .
intermittent power supplies have made pumps reliant on generators , which in turn have lacked spare parts and fuel .
the who says operation cast lead worsened an already bad situation .
before the operation , it says gazans had only half the water they needed according to international standards , and 80 % of water supplied did not meet who drinking standards .
at the height of the january fighting , half of gaza 's population had no access to piped water .
gaza 's sewage treatment body estimates that at least 50m litres of raw or poorly-treated sewage is released into the sea daily .
some of gaza 's sewage is stored in huge lagoons , one of which burst in 2007 causing at least five deaths .
click here to return businesses overall , the un says the blockade has caused the economy " irreversible damage " .
unemployment has soared from 30 % in 2007 to 40 % in 2008 , according to the world bank , though it dropped slightly in early 2010 .
the un says that when aid is discounted , 70 % of gazan families live on less than a dollar a day per person .
the closures have devastated the private sector .
before 2007 , up to about 750 trucks of furniture , food products , textiles and agricultural produce left gaza each month , worth half a million us dollars a day .
under the blockade , the only exports allowed have been a small number of trucks of strawberries and flowers - although the situation improved slightly in early 2010 , with 118 trucks leaving between december 2009 to april 2010 .
even production for local needs has come to a virtual standstill because raw materials are usually refused entry according to israeli rights organisation gisha , small containers of margarine are allowed in for household consumption , but not large buckets , which might be used for industrial food manufacturing .
some industrial premises have resumed limited production using goods brought in from the tunnels .
before the blockade , 3,900 industrial premises were operating , employing 35,000 people - by june 2008 , only 90 were still functioning , employing only 860 , according to the palestinian trade center .
the situation improved slightly during the truce .
an estimated total of $ 140m of damage was done to gaza businesses during the december and january military operation , according to a palestinian business body , the palestinian private sector coordinating council .
click here to return agriculture agriculture is also an important employer , but with exports at almost zero , thousands of tonnes of flowers , fruit and vegetables have been destroyed or sold at a loss on the local market .
other food production has also been affected - for example , rising fishermen 's fuel costs pushed up the price of sardines , and one poultry farmer had to slaughter 165,000 chicks because he did not have the fuel for the incubators to keep them alive .
the un 's fao says $ 180m of trees , fields , livestock , greenhouses and nurseries were destroyed during operation cast lead .
the palestinian authority estimates 15 % of agricultural land was destroyed .
the fao says the closed borders are a major obstacle to reconstruction , with fertilizer , livestock , seedlings and agricultural equipment in short supply .
israel says that in 2010 it has allowed potato seeds , eggs for reproduction , bees and fertiliser that could not be used to manufacture explosives into the strip .
click here to return construction restrictions on construction materials , particularly cement , and spare parts for machinery , have had a big impact on projects ranging from water treatment to grave digging .
reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure destroyed in the 2009 israeli operations in gaza has been virtually impossible .
the un says restrictions on cement have made the reconstruction of 12,000 palestinian homes damaged or destroyed in israeli military operations " impossible " .
it says it has not been able to build schools to house 15,000 new pupils , necessary because of population growth since the blockade began .
a few hundred tonnes of cement entered gaza in the first half of 2010 , but aid organisations say this is a fraction of the need - gisha says 70,000 tonnes arrived monthly before the blockade .
even before operation cast lead , all factories making construction materials had shut down -lrb- 13 making tiles , 30 concrete , 145 marble and 250 making bricks -rrb- , and the building of roads , water and sanitation infrastructure , medical facilities , schools and housing was on hold .
during the truce , some trucks of cement and gravel began to enter gaza , but the volume was well below the need , and the flow stopped as the truce fell apart .
click here to return medical care the world health organization says the blockade has led to a general " worsening of the health conditions of the population " and " accelerated the degeneration " of the health system .
israel generally allows medicines into gaza .
the who says that shortages of drugs are a problem , with 15-30 % of essential drugs out of stock over 2009 .
but it blames problems in the supply chain , including the rift between fatah and hamas .
however it says the blockade is a major factor in the " dire state " of much of gaza 's medical equipment , with delays in approval of machines and spare parts , and engineers denied access to fit them .
the medical system has also struggled with lack of spare parts and , at times , fuel for back-up generators , and lack of building work because of the shortage of materials .
before operation cast lead , gaza had only 133 hospital beds per 100,000 population , compared to 583 in israel , and it lost some of that capacity in the fighting .
six hospitals suffered damage , including one that had a new building completely destroyed , another lost two whole floors .
gaza is simply not equipped to treat many severe cases .
according to israeli figures , 10,544 patients and their companions left the gaza strip for medical treatment in israel in 2009 .
but the who says that in december 2009 , permission for 21 % of patients was denied or delayed , and 27 patients in total died during the year while waiting for referrals to israel .
the rafah crossing into egypt has been closed since june 2007 , although special medical cases are sporadically allowed to pass through it .
israel says extensive security screening is necessary , as it says three people with permits to leave for medical reasons have been found to be planning attacks in israel .
it also says it has offered to facilitate passage through israel to jordan for palestinians it refuses permits to on security grounds .

some details of how this will happen have emerged .
the israeli authorities have moved from a limited list of permitted goods , to a list of specifically prohibited goods and materials that might have military applications .
according to reports , israeli authorities will allow more civilian goods to enter , including all food items , toys , stationery , kitchen utensils , mattresses and towels .
construction materials for civilian projects will be allowed in under international supervision .
the strip was out under a heightened israeli blockade since the militant group hamas seized control in june 2007 .
israel wants to weaken hamas , end rocket attacks from gaza and get back captured soldier gilad shalit .
the blockade has been widely described as " collective punishment " resulting in a humanitarian crisis ; un officials have described the situation as " grim " , " deteriorating " and a " medieval siege " , but israel says there are no shortages in gaza , pointing to the aid it allows in .
overview food fuel electricity sewage and water businesses agriculture construction medical care overview : what gets in for much of the three years since hamas took control of gaza , its 1.5m people have relied on less than a quarter of the volume of imported supplies they received in december 2005 .
in the wake of the hamas takeover , israel said it would allow only basic humanitarian supplies into the strip .
it has a list of dual-use items such as steel pipes and fertiliser which it says could be used to manufacture weapons .
these are not allowed in , with the exception of " special humanitarian cases " .
other than that , no specific list of what is and is not allowed in has been published , and items gaining entry vary over time .
the un relief agency for palestinian refugees unrwa 's list of household items that have been refused entry at various times includes light bulbs , candles , matches , books , musical instruments , crayons , clothing , shoes , mattresses , sheets , blankets , pasta , tea , coffee , chocolate , nuts , shampoo and conditioner .
goods allowed into gaza canned meat and tuna , but not canned fruit mineral water , but not fruit juice sesame paste -lrb- tahini -rrb- but not jam tea and coffee but not chocolate download the full list -lsb- 89.9 kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here details of gaza blockade revealed un impatient as blockade stalls building many other items - ranging from cars to fridges to computers - are generally refused entry .
building materials such as cement , concrete and wood were nearly always refused entry until early 2010 , when some glass , wood , cement and aluminium were allowed in .
during the six month truce between israel and hamas , which began in june 2008 , and in early 2010 , the volume and range of goods increased with trucks of shoes and clothes entering gaza .
israel says hamas has diverted aid in the past , and could appropriate building materials for its own use .
aid agencies say they have stringent monitoring systems in place .
click here to return food aid agencies operating in gaza say they have largely been able to continue to transport basic supplies such as flour and cooking oil into the territory .
but the un 's food and agriculture organisation says 61 % of gazans are " food insecure " .
according to the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , 80 % of gazan households rely on some kind of food aid .
unrwa provides food aid for 750,000 people , half the population .
its food distribution has been suspended several times since june 2007 as a result of border closures or fuel shortages .
israel usually says crossings are closed for security reasons , pointing to occasions when palestinian militants have attacked the crossings or fired barrages of rockets into israel .
unrwa rations provide about two-thirds of dietary needs , and so need to be supplemented by dairy products , meat , fish and fresh fruit and vegetables .
some of these items are grown locally , some allowed in from israel , and some smuggled in through tunnels under the egypt-gaza border .
but with the palestinian bureau of statistics estimating unemployment at 38.6 % in early 2010 , some gazans can not afford the basics , even if they are physically available .
unrwa says the number of gazan that it helps who are unable to buy basic items such as soap , stationary and safe drinking water has tripled since 2007 .
a un survey in 2008 found more than half gaza 's households had sold their disposable assets and were relying on credit to buy food , three-quarters of gazans were buying less food than in the past , and almost all were eating less fresh fruit , vegetables and animal protein to save money .
the israeli military operation in december and january 2009 disrupted food aid transfer and distribution significantly , as well as causing what the un fao estimates at $ 180m of damage to the agricultural sector .
according to the world health organization , one third of children under five and women of childbearing age are anaemic .
click here to return fuel and power in september 2007 , the israeli government declared the strip a " hostile entity " in response to continued rocket attacks on southern israel , and said it would start cutting fuel imports .
at times , petrol and diesel shortages have caused major problems .
donkey carts are a common sight in gaza .
vehicle fuel enters from egypt through the tunnels .
according to information complied by oxfam , no petrol or diesel for vehicles has been allowed in from israel since november 2008 , except for fuel for un cars and five other shipments in three years .

a un survey in 2008 found more than half gaza 's households had sold their disposable assets and were relying on credit to buy food , three-quarters of gazans were buying less food than in the past , and almost all were eating less fresh fruit , vegetables and animal protein to save money .
the israeli military operation in december and january 2009 disrupted food aid transfer and distribution significantly , as well as causing what the un fao estimates at $ 180m of damage to the agricultural sector .
according to the world health organization , one third of children under five and women of childbearing age are anaemic .
click here to return fuel and power in september 2007 , the israeli government declared the strip a " hostile entity " in response to continued rocket attacks on southern israel , and said it would start cutting fuel imports .
at times , petrol and diesel shortages have caused major problems .
donkey carts are a common sight in gaza .
vehicle fuel enters from egypt through the tunnels .
according to information complied by oxfam , no petrol or diesel for vehicles has been allowed in from israel since november 2008 , except for fuel for un cars and five other shipments in three years .
the amount of cooking gas allowed in has generally fluctuated between about a third and a half of requirements , oxfam figures show .
click here to return electricity gaza 's electricity supply is made up of 144mw from israel , 17mw from egypt and the rest from an eu-run power plant in gaza which can generate up to 80mw .
the power plant 's fuel is usually brought in through the main fuel entry point , the nahal oz crossing .
the plant has shut down completely several times after running out of fuel because the crossing was closed .
it was out of fuel for most of the israeli operation in january 2009 , leaving two-thirds of gazans without power at the height of the crisis .
since early 2008 , the power plant has received enough fuel to operate at only about two-thirds of its capacity - in line with an israeli supreme court ruling which set a minimum amount of fuel that israel must allow into gaza .
figures monitored by international agencies show fuel deliveries dropped even below these minimums at several points in the first half of 2008 .
in late 2009 , the responsibility for funding the fuel was transferred from the eu to the ramallah-based palestinian authority - since then the amount of fuel supplied has declined .
in april and may 2010 , fuel supply fluctuated , with the plant able to operate at between 20 and 50 % of its capacity .
power cuts remain frequent .
research by oxfam in april 2010 showed houses across gaza without power for 35-60 hours a week .
click here to return sewage and water the blockade has taken its toll on gaza 's water and sewage network .
lack of spare parts has made repairs difficult .
intermittent power supplies have made pumps reliant on generators , which in turn have lacked spare parts and fuel .
the who says operation cast lead worsened an already bad situation .
before the operation , it says gazans had only half the water they needed according to international standards , and 80 % of water supplied did not meet who drinking standards .
at the height of the january fighting , half of gaza 's population had no access to piped water .
gaza 's sewage treatment body estimates that at least 50m litres of raw or poorly-treated sewage is released into the sea daily .
some of gaza 's sewage is stored in huge lagoons , one of which burst in 2007 causing at least five deaths .
click here to return businesses overall , the un says the blockade has caused the economy " irreversible damage " .
unemployment has soared from 30 % in 2007 to 40 % in 2008 , according to the world bank , though it dropped slightly in early 2010 .
the un says that when aid is discounted , 70 % of gazan families live on less than a dollar a day per person .
the closures have devastated the private sector .
before 2007 , up to about 750 trucks of furniture , food products , textiles and agricultural produce left gaza each month , worth half a million us dollars a day .
under the blockade , the only exports allowed have been a small number of trucks of strawberries and flowers - although the situation improved slightly in early 2010 , with 118 trucks leaving between december 2009 to april 2010 .
even production for local needs has come to a virtual standstill because raw materials are usually refused entry according to israeli rights organisation gisha , small containers of margarine are allowed in for household consumption , but not large buckets , which might be used for industrial food manufacturing .
some industrial premises have resumed limited production using goods brought in from the tunnels .
before the blockade , 3,900 industrial premises were operating , employing 35,000 people - by june 2008 , only 90 were still functioning , employing only 860 , according to the palestinian trade center .
the situation improved slightly during the truce .
an estimated total of $ 140m of damage was done to gaza businesses during the december and january military operation , according to a palestinian business body , the palestinian private sector coordinating council .
click here to return agriculture agriculture is also an important employer , but with exports at almost zero , thousands of tonnes of flowers , fruit and vegetables have been destroyed or sold at a loss on the local market .
other food production has also been affected - for example , rising fishermen 's fuel costs pushed up the price of sardines , and one poultry farmer had to slaughter 165,000 chicks because he did not have the fuel for the incubators to keep them alive .
the un 's fao says $ 180m of trees , fields , livestock , greenhouses and nurseries were destroyed during operation cast lead .
the palestinian authority estimates 15 % of agricultural land was destroyed .
the fao says the closed borders are a major obstacle to reconstruction , with fertilizer , livestock , seedlings and agricultural equipment in short supply .
israel says that in 2010 it has allowed potato seeds , eggs for reproduction , bees and fertiliser that could not be used to manufacture explosives into the strip .
click here to return construction restrictions on construction materials , particularly cement , and spare parts for machinery , have had a big impact on projects ranging from water treatment to grave digging .
reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure destroyed in the 2009 israeli operations in gaza has been virtually impossible .
the un says restrictions on cement have made the reconstruction of 12,000 palestinian homes damaged or destroyed in israeli military operations " impossible " .
it says it has not been able to build schools to house 15,000 new pupils , necessary because of population growth since the blockade began .
a few hundred tonnes of cement entered gaza in the first half of 2010 , but aid organisations say this is a fraction of the need - gisha says 70,000 tonnes arrived monthly before the blockade .
even before operation cast lead , all factories making construction materials had shut down -lrb- 13 making tiles , 30 concrete , 145 marble and 250 making bricks -rrb- , and the building of roads , water and sanitation infrastructure , medical facilities , schools and housing was on hold .
during the truce , some trucks of cement and gravel began to enter gaza , but the volume was well below the need , and the flow stopped as the truce fell apart .
click here to return medical care the world health organization says the blockade has led to a general " worsening of the health conditions of the population " and " accelerated the degeneration " of the health system .
israel generally allows medicines into gaza .
the who says that shortages of drugs are a problem , with 15-30 % of essential drugs out of stock over 2009 .
but it blames problems in the supply chain , including the rift between fatah and hamas .
however it says the blockade is a major factor in the " dire state " of much of gaza 's medical equipment , with delays in approval of machines and spare parts , and engineers denied access to fit them .
the medical system has also struggled with lack of spare parts and , at times , fuel for back-up generators , and lack of building work because of the shortage of materials .
before operation cast lead , gaza had only 133 hospital beds per 100,000 population , compared to 583 in israel , and it lost some of that capacity in the fighting .
six hospitals suffered damage , including one that had a new building completely destroyed , another lost two whole floors .
gaza is simply not equipped to treat many severe cases .
according to israeli figures , 10,544 patients and their companions left the gaza strip for medical treatment in israel in 2009 .
but the who says that in december 2009 , permission for 21 % of patients was denied or delayed , and 27 patients in total died during the year while waiting for referrals to israel .
the rafah crossing into egypt has been closed since june 2007 , although special medical cases are sporadically allowed to pass through it .
israel says extensive security screening is necessary , as it says three people with permits to leave for medical reasons have been found to be planning attacks in israel .
it also says it has offered to facilitate passage through israel to jordan for palestinians it refuses permits to on security grounds .

some details of how this will happen have emerged .
the israeli authorities have moved from a limited list of permitted goods , to a list of specifically prohibited goods and materials that might have military applications .
according to reports , israeli authorities will allow more civilian goods to enter , including all food items , toys , stationery , kitchen utensils , mattresses and towels .
construction materials for civilian projects will be allowed in under international supervision .
the strip was out under a heightened israeli blockade since the militant group hamas seized control in june 2007 .
israel wants to weaken hamas , end rocket attacks from gaza and get back captured soldier gilad shalit .
the blockade has been widely described as " collective punishment " resulting in a humanitarian crisis ; un officials have described the situation as " grim " , " deteriorating " and a " medieval siege " , but israel says there are no shortages in gaza , pointing to the aid it allows in .
overview food fuel electricity sewage and water businesses agriculture construction medical care overview : what gets in for much of the three years since hamas took control of gaza , its 1.5m people have relied on less than a quarter of the volume of imported supplies they received in december 2005 .
in the wake of the hamas takeover , israel said it would allow only basic humanitarian supplies into the strip .
it has a list of dual-use items such as steel pipes and fertiliser which it says could be used to manufacture weapons .
these are not allowed in , with the exception of " special humanitarian cases " .
other than that , no specific list of what is and is not allowed in has been published , and items gaining entry vary over time .
the un relief agency for palestinian refugees unrwa 's list of household items that have been refused entry at various times includes light bulbs , candles , matches , books , musical instruments , crayons , clothing , shoes , mattresses , sheets , blankets , pasta , tea , coffee , chocolate , nuts , shampoo and conditioner .

building materials such as cement , concrete and wood were nearly always refused entry until early 2010 , when some glass , wood , cement and aluminium were allowed in .
during the six month truce between israel and hamas , which began in june 2008 , and in early 2010 , the volume and range of goods increased with trucks of shoes and clothes entering gaza .
israel says hamas has diverted aid in the past , and could appropriate building materials for its own use .
aid agencies say they have stringent monitoring systems in place .
click here to return food aid agencies operating in gaza say they have largely been able to continue to transport basic supplies such as flour and cooking oil into the territory .
but the un 's food and agriculture organisation says 61 % of gazans are " food insecure " .
according to the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , 80 % of gazan households rely on some kind of food aid .
unrwa provides food aid for 750,000 people , half the population .
its food distribution has been suspended several times since june 2007 as a result of border closures or fuel shortages .
israel usually says crossings are closed for security reasons , pointing to occasions when palestinian militants have attacked the crossings or fired barrages of rockets into israel .
unrwa rations provide about two-thirds of dietary needs , and so need to be supplemented by dairy products , meat , fish and fresh fruit and vegetables .
some of these items are grown locally , some allowed in from israel , and some smuggled in through tunnels under the egypt-gaza border .
but with the palestinian bureau of statistics estimating unemployment at 38.6 % in early 2010 , some gazans can not afford the basics , even if they are physically available .

its food distribution has been suspended several times since june 2007 as a result of border closures or fuel shortages .
israel usually says crossings are closed for security reasons , pointing to occasions when palestinian militants have attacked the crossings or fired barrages of rockets into israel .
unrwa rations provide about two-thirds of dietary needs , and so need to be supplemented by dairy products , meat , fish and fresh fruit and vegetables .
some of these items are grown locally , some allowed in from israel , and some smuggled in through tunnels under the egypt-gaza border .
but with the palestinian bureau of statistics estimating unemployment at 38.6 % in early 2010 , some gazans can not afford the basics , even if they are physically available .
unrwa says the number of gazan that it helps who are unable to buy basic items such as soap , stationary and safe drinking water has tripled since 2007 .
a un survey in 2008 found more than half gaza 's households had sold their disposable assets and were relying on credit to buy food , three-quarters of gazans were buying less food than in the past , and almost all were eating less fresh fruit , vegetables and animal protein to save money .
the israeli military operation in december and january 2009 disrupted food aid transfer and distribution significantly , as well as causing what the un fao estimates at $ 180m of damage to the agricultural sector .
according to the world health organization , one third of children under five and women of childbearing age are anaemic .
click here to return fuel and power in september 2007 , the israeli government declared the strip a " hostile entity " in response to continued rocket attacks on southern israel , and said it would start cutting fuel imports .
at times , petrol and diesel shortages have caused major problems .
donkey carts are a common sight in gaza .
vehicle fuel enters from egypt through the tunnels .
according to information complied by oxfam , no petrol or diesel for vehicles has been allowed in from israel since november 2008 , except for fuel for un cars and five other shipments in three years .
the amount of cooking gas allowed in has generally fluctuated between about a third and a half of requirements , oxfam figures show .
click here to return electricity gaza 's electricity supply is made up of 144mw from israel , 17mw from egypt and the rest from an eu-run power plant in gaza which can generate up to 80mw .
the power plant 's fuel is usually brought in through the main fuel entry point , the nahal oz crossing .
the plant has shut down completely several times after running out of fuel because the crossing was closed .
it was out of fuel for most of the israeli operation in january 2009 , leaving two-thirds of gazans without power at the height of the crisis .
since early 2008 , the power plant has received enough fuel to operate at only about two-thirds of its capacity - in line with an israeli supreme court ruling which set a minimum amount of fuel that israel must allow into gaza .
figures monitored by international agencies show fuel deliveries dropped even below these minimums at several points in the first half of 2008 .
in late 2009 , the responsibility for funding the fuel was transferred from the eu to the ramallah-based palestinian authority - since then the amount of fuel supplied has declined .
in april and may 2010 , fuel supply fluctuated , with the plant able to operate at between 20 and 50 % of its capacity .
power cuts remain frequent .
research by oxfam in april 2010 showed houses across gaza without power for 35-60 hours a week .
click here to return sewage and water the blockade has taken its toll on gaza 's water and sewage network .
lack of spare parts has made repairs difficult .
intermittent power supplies have made pumps reliant on generators , which in turn have lacked spare parts and fuel .
the who says operation cast lead worsened an already bad situation .
before the operation , it says gazans had only half the water they needed according to international standards , and 80 % of water supplied did not meet who drinking standards .
at the height of the january fighting , half of gaza 's population had no access to piped water .
gaza 's sewage treatment body estimates that at least 50m litres of raw or poorly-treated sewage is released into the sea daily .
some of gaza 's sewage is stored in huge lagoons , one of which burst in 2007 causing at least five deaths .
click here to return businesses overall , the un says the blockade has caused the economy " irreversible damage " .
unemployment has soared from 30 % in 2007 to 40 % in 2008 , according to the world bank , though it dropped slightly in early 2010 .
the un says that when aid is discounted , 70 % of gazan families live on less than a dollar a day per person .
the closures have devastated the private sector .
before 2007 , up to about 750 trucks of furniture , food products , textiles and agricultural produce left gaza each month , worth half a million us dollars a day .
under the blockade , the only exports allowed have been a small number of trucks of strawberries and flowers - although the situation improved slightly in early 2010 , with 118 trucks leaving between december 2009 to april 2010 .
even production for local needs has come to a virtual standstill because raw materials are usually refused entry according to israeli rights organisation gisha , small containers of margarine are allowed in for household consumption , but not large buckets , which might be used for industrial food manufacturing .
some industrial premises have resumed limited production using goods brought in from the tunnels .
before the blockade , 3,900 industrial premises were operating , employing 35,000 people - by june 2008 , only 90 were still functioning , employing only 860 , according to the palestinian trade center .
the situation improved slightly during the truce .
an estimated total of $ 140m of damage was done to gaza businesses during the december and january military operation , according to a palestinian business body , the palestinian private sector coordinating council .
click here to return agriculture agriculture is also an important employer , but with exports at almost zero , thousands of tonnes of flowers , fruit and vegetables have been destroyed or sold at a loss on the local market .
other food production has also been affected - for example , rising fishermen 's fuel costs pushed up the price of sardines , and one poultry farmer had to slaughter 165,000 chicks because he did not have the fuel for the incubators to keep them alive .
the un 's fao says $ 180m of trees , fields , livestock , greenhouses and nurseries were destroyed during operation cast lead .
the palestinian authority estimates 15 % of agricultural land was destroyed .
the fao says the closed borders are a major obstacle to reconstruction , with fertilizer , livestock , seedlings and agricultural equipment in short supply .
israel says that in 2010 it has allowed potato seeds , eggs for reproduction , bees and fertiliser that could not be used to manufacture explosives into the strip .
click here to return construction restrictions on construction materials , particularly cement , and spare parts for machinery , have had a big impact on projects ranging from water treatment to grave digging .
reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure destroyed in the 2009 israeli operations in gaza has been virtually impossible .
the un says restrictions on cement have made the reconstruction of 12,000 palestinian homes damaged or destroyed in israeli military operations " impossible " .
it says it has not been able to build schools to house 15,000 new pupils , necessary because of population growth since the blockade began .
a few hundred tonnes of cement entered gaza in the first half of 2010 , but aid organisations say this is a fraction of the need - gisha says 70,000 tonnes arrived monthly before the blockade .
even before operation cast lead , all factories making construction materials had shut down -lrb- 13 making tiles , 30 concrete , 145 marble and 250 making bricks -rrb- , and the building of roads , water and sanitation infrastructure , medical facilities , schools and housing was on hold .
during the truce , some trucks of cement and gravel began to enter gaza , but the volume was well below the need , and the flow stopped as the truce fell apart .
click here to return medical care the world health organization says the blockade has led to a general " worsening of the health conditions of the population " and " accelerated the degeneration " of the health system .
israel generally allows medicines into gaza .
the who says that shortages of drugs are a problem , with 15-30 % of essential drugs out of stock over 2009 .
but it blames problems in the supply chain , including the rift between fatah and hamas .
however it says the blockade is a major factor in the " dire state " of much of gaza 's medical equipment , with delays in approval of machines and spare parts , and engineers denied access to fit them .
the medical system has also struggled with lack of spare parts and , at times , fuel for back-up generators , and lack of building work because of the shortage of materials .
before operation cast lead , gaza had only 133 hospital beds per 100,000 population , compared to 583 in israel , and it lost some of that capacity in the fighting .
six hospitals suffered damage , including one that had a new building completely destroyed , another lost two whole floors .
gaza is simply not equipped to treat many severe cases .
according to israeli figures , 10,544 patients and their companions left the gaza strip for medical treatment in israel in 2009 .
but the who says that in december 2009 , permission for 21 % of patients was denied or delayed , and 27 patients in total died during the year while waiting for referrals to israel .
the rafah crossing into egypt has been closed since june 2007 , although special medical cases are sporadically allowed to pass through it .
israel says extensive security screening is necessary , as it says three people with permits to leave for medical reasons have been found to be planning attacks in israel .
it also says it has offered to facilitate passage through israel to jordan for palestinians it refuses permits to on security grounds .

some details of how this will happen have emerged .
the israeli authorities have moved from a limited list of permitted goods , to a list of specifically prohibited goods and materials that might have military applications .
according to reports , israeli authorities will allow more civilian goods to enter , including all food items , toys , stationery , kitchen utensils , mattresses and towels .
construction materials for civilian projects will be allowed in under international supervision .
the strip was out under a heightened israeli blockade since the militant group hamas seized control in june 2007 .
israel wants to weaken hamas , end rocket attacks from gaza and get back captured soldier gilad shalit .
the blockade has been widely described as " collective punishment " resulting in a humanitarian crisis ; un officials have described the situation as " grim " , " deteriorating " and a " medieval siege " , but israel says there are no shortages in gaza , pointing to the aid it allows in .
overview food fuel electricity sewage and water businesses agriculture construction medical care overview : what gets in for much of the three years since hamas took control of gaza , its 1.5m people have relied on less than a quarter of the volume of imported supplies they received in december 2005 .
in the wake of the hamas takeover , israel said it would allow only basic humanitarian supplies into the strip .
it has a list of dual-use items such as steel pipes and fertiliser which it says could be used to manufacture weapons .
these are not allowed in , with the exception of " special humanitarian cases " .
other than that , no specific list of what is and is not allowed in has been published , and items gaining entry vary over time .
the un relief agency for palestinian refugees unrwa 's list of household items that have been refused entry at various times includes light bulbs , candles , matches , books , musical instruments , crayons , clothing , shoes , mattresses , sheets , blankets , pasta , tea , coffee , chocolate , nuts , shampoo and conditioner .
goods allowed into gaza canned meat and tuna , but not canned fruit mineral water , but not fruit juice sesame paste -lrb- tahini -rrb- but not jam tea and coffee but not chocolate download the full list -lsb- 89.9 kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here details of gaza blockade revealed un impatient as blockade stalls building many other items - ranging from cars to fridges to computers - are generally refused entry .
building materials such as cement , concrete and wood were nearly always refused entry until early 2010 , when some glass , wood , cement and aluminium were allowed in .
during the six month truce between israel and hamas , which began in june 2008 , and in early 2010 , the volume and range of goods increased with trucks of shoes and clothes entering gaza .
israel says hamas has diverted aid in the past , and could appropriate building materials for its own use .
aid agencies say they have stringent monitoring systems in place .
click here to return food aid agencies operating in gaza say they have largely been able to continue to transport basic supplies such as flour and cooking oil into the territory .
but the un 's food and agriculture organisation says 61 % of gazans are " food insecure " .
according to the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , 80 % of gazan households rely on some kind of food aid .

bbc - bristol - bristol doctor on row ' challenge ' bbc - bristol / people & places bbc local -pipe- bristol -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 10:35 gmt , tuesday , 6 july 2010 11:35 uk bristol doctor on row ' challenge ' an army doctor from bristol has spoken of the teamwork needed to set a new world record for rowing non-stop around britain .
captain nick dennison of the royal army medical corps , who grew up in redland , rowed alongside captain hamish reid .
the difficult challenge took 50 days and five hours to complete .
the dynamic duo left lymington in hampshire on 12 may in their 24 foot ocean going rowing boat , komale .
they crossed the finish line on the solent on 1 july , some 2,100 miles later .
it 's estimated that bristolian nick and hamish have raised around £ 20,000 for charities help for heroes and the army benevolent fund .
they battled high seas , fierce winds and strong tides on the journey , although nick admits that it could have been a lot worse .
" we were genuinely lucky with the weather even though at the time i do n't think we felt like we were , " he said .
" the biggest seas that we got were probably about seven or eight metres swell in the north sea .
" that was quite a challenge to contend with . "
and nick said that conditions were difficult in the boat as well .
" we really mixed it up , " he said .
" sometimes the wind and the tide were such that you could n't make progress with one person rowing , so we had to row together .
" especially the last five days , which were pretty gritty .
" we had to row together for the majority of that time - usually six hours out of seven .
" so , you might get half an hour off to get a bit of food down you and a bit of rest and then get back on the oars again . "
nick and hamish were unable to get off the boat once they had left lymington and had to take everything with them for their journey .
" we did it unsupported and continuous , " added nick .
" we carried 60 days worth of food with us and had a special desalination machine to make our own water .

captain nick dennison of the royal army medical corps , who grew up in redland , rowed alongside captain hamish reid .
the difficult challenge took 50 days and five hours to complete .
the dynamic duo left lymington in hampshire on 12 may in their 24 foot ocean going rowing boat , komale .
they crossed the finish line on the solent on 1 july , some 2,100 miles later .
it 's estimated that bristolian nick and hamish have raised around £ 20,000 for charities help for heroes and the army benevolent fund .

" we were genuinely lucky with the weather even though at the time i do n't think we felt like we were , " he said .
" the biggest seas that we got were probably about seven or eight metres swell in the north sea .
" that was quite a challenge to contend with . "
and nick said that conditions were difficult in the boat as well .
" we really mixed it up , " he said .
" sometimes the wind and the tide were such that you could n't make progress with one person rowing , so we had to row together .
" especially the last five days , which were pretty gritty .
" we had to row together for the majority of that time - usually six hours out of seven .
" so , you might get half an hour off to get a bit of food down you and a bit of rest and then get back on the oars again . "
bristol 's nick dennison set a world record for rowing around great britain nick and hamish were unable to get off the boat once they had left lymington and had to take everything with them for their journey .
" we did it unsupported and continuous , " added nick .
" we carried 60 days worth of food with us and had a special desalination machine to make our own water .

bbc - cambridgeshire - enter the eel catcher 's workshop / nature & outdoors bbc local -pipe- cambridgeshire -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 10:35 gmt , tuesday , 6 july 2010 11:35 uk enter the eel catcher 's workshop cambridgeshire 's last eel catcher is opening his outwell workshop to visitors .
peter carter says he has had so many requests to see how he works , he has decided to open to the public three times a week .
" my family has been doing it for 500 years , " said peter , who has traced this back through the diaries kept by his female ancestors .
the fens used to have many eel catchers but the trade has dwindled .
catching eels it is not just the eel catcher which is an increasingly endangered species .
eel numbers worldwide have plummeted .
experts believe they are at 10 per cent of their 1970s ' level .
there have even been calls for a closed season or an outright ban .
in the meantime , peter continues to catch eels the way his ancestors did , without nets .
" i set the eel traps along the river in the evening , " he explained .
" and hopefully get a good catch for the morning and then it 's sold off to local people , markets or whatever .
" i do n't use a watch , i get up when i get up and i go down there and get home when i 've finished . "
wicker traps he uses willow to make his traps , in the same way his ancestors did .
visitors to the workshop will be able to see how he makes them , alongside other wicker products .
the carter family followed a traditional fen way of life for centuries , which included peat cutting and water-fowling .
peter has displays of family photographs , revealing the way they lived , in his workshop .
there 's another attraction too .
" we 've got a big old punt gun they can have a look at , " peter said .
" that was for shooting the ducks . "
punt guns were first used for hunting at the beginning of the 19th century and were usually too big to be held by one person so were fired from punts .
wildlife peter says he loves the way of life : " getting out in the mornings , the wildlife , the peace and the quiet , the slow pace .
" i do n't have to rush around chasing to an office or anything like that .
there 's a kingfisher and he 's always around watching to see what i 'm doing too . "
so to find out a bit more about the life and times of an eel catcher , you can visit peter in his workshop on mondays , wednesdays and fridays .
he is based at church terrace , opposite st clement church in outwell , and opening hours are 10.00 to 16.00 .
for more information , call 01945 772157 .

the peace process , the iranian nuclear issue and the restoration of relations between turkey and israel are said to hinge on the summit .
the press in israel urge their prime minister to take decisive action to restore israel 's international standing and repair relations with the us .
one newspaper noted that it was in the interests of both mr obama and mr netanyahu to secure at least superficial progress .
palestinian opinion expressed concern that the meeting might simply be a public relations stunt to boost the standing of the respective leaders .
papers in egypt , lebanon and jordan were sceptical about the likelihood of real progress on the peace process , saying that the meeting was likely to focus on repairing ties between israel and turkey .
amnon abramovich in israel 's yediot aharanot netanyahu is a wise , realistic man who realises what 's at stake .
here we have the nuclear iran , there we have demographic-political processes , in the midst of it all there 's the occupation , and coming up from behind we have rapid erosion of the state of israel 's legitimacy .
netanyahu realises that he must take action .
he knows he must do it now .
editorial in israel 's jerusalem post netanyahu will undoubtedly seek to be reassured of us backing for israel 's policy of nuclear ambiguity , no longer taken for granted in jerusalem ...
the meeting also presents a welcome opportunity to push for progress in talks with the palestinians - progress that the prime minister has made clear israel needs , as it seeks to guarantee its jewish , democratic future alongside what it must be certain would be a peaceful , stable palestinian state .
aluf benn in israel 's ha 'aretz obama and netanyahu will try to gauge each other 's political strength ...

netanyahu wants to reverse israel 's growing international isolation .

editorial in palestinian al-quds israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is scheduled to meet us president barack obama in washington in what some sources have described as a decisive summit in which a breakthrough in the peace process will be discussed ...
soon we will know whether this meeting was a crucial meeting or a public relations stunt .
ala al-rinawi in palestinian filastin the meeting between -lsb- palestinian prime minister salam -rsb- fayyad and -lsb- israeli defence minister ehud -rsb- barak was a public relations coup for netanyahu in advance of his meeting with obama .
netanyahu will also claim that the siege on gaza has been eased and that he has prevented the construction of 60 houses for settlers in jerusalem .
editorial in egypt 's al-ahram although it is too early to predict the outcome of talks between obama and netanyahu regarding the palestinian problem , early signs do not provide cause for optimism ...
but there will be important results for other hot issues in the middle east , at the forefront of which is the iranian nuclear programme .
kluvis maqsud in lebanon 's al-safir president obama wants to relieve tension and normalise turkish-israeli relations ...
any breakthrough in the peace process and resumption of negotiations between the palestinian national authority and israel will not be achieved because the us administration is still incapable of making israel admit it is an occupation force in the palestinian lands .
muhammad kharrub in jordan 's al-ra 'y the iranian nuclear issue and attempts by washington to mend relations with ankara will top the agenda , rather than the peace process ...
there will be a joint us-israeli invitation to the palestinian national authority to enter into direct negotiations after " proximity " talks have achieved their media purpose .

the elite housecarls and their axes were a potent force .
but they had also marched at speed down from the north , where harold had defeated the viking invader harold hardrada .
william 's secret weapon was his cavalry .
harold knew that their speed and force could be decisive and he chose to muster on senlac hill , using the gradient against his foe .
harold 's shield wall held firm for most of the day against three separate assaults by the normans .
but in the end it was worn down by norman archers .
a bloodbath would ensue - an estimated 4000 men died .
this is the key image that many take to be that of harold , with an arrow in his eye .
the words ' harold rex ' indicate that this part of the tapestry shows the king .
but is this the king ?
the rest of the panel shows another man being slain by a horseman .
the inscription reads ' hic harold rex interfectus est ' .
but the words ' interfectus est ' -lrb- has been killed -rrb- appear to refer to the second man .
however harold died , anglo-saxon england died with him on that day .
the tapestry shows saxons fleeing the field , many cut down by the norman victors .
england would never be the same again .

advertisement look back at battle of flowers 1910 the jersey battle of flowers started life as a celebration of the coronation of kind edward vii in 1902 but was so popular it returned the following year .
in the early days of battle , floats were usually horse drawn and flowers were torn off at the end .
it was the practice of tearing and throwing flowers that gave the event the battle of flowers name .
now , 108 years after that first event , thousands still flock to jersey to watch the islands biggest annual event .
the 1910 battle included a float with a fairy tale theme the battle of flowers stopped during the wwi , starting up again in 1926 and again during the german occupation of the island - starting again in 1951 .
the early days of battle were similar in form to the spectacle that spans victoria avenue every august now - just a lot smaller .
newsreel footage from british pathe of the 1910 battle shows floats drawn by horses , led by small boys holding a road and floats covering in flowers , on float were girls in white surrounded by a gazebo .
there was also a flower covered castle tower with a fairy tale king in a big crown and long beard surrounded with little boys in sailor suits .
the largest ever crowd for battle - over 60,000 people - was in 1969 , it would never be as popular again .
battle veteran florence bechelet said that every hotel was full that year and a special boat was put on .
she said : " it would bring people in the morning and take them back at night .
it 's the best thing we have in the island . "
battle of flowers started in 1902 jersey 's economic development minister , senator alan maclean , said battle and other events need to find private sponsors to keep them alive .
he said : " events that need public funding need to be given some assistance in putting their proposition together as a package that will appeal to the private sector for corporate sponsorship purposes .
" i 'm absolutely convinced that there is opportunity there to raise more money to support these important events . "
the 2010 battle of flowers main parade is on thursday 12 august with the moonlight parade on friday 13 august .
it 's thought around 25,000 people will watch this years event .
have your say should the battle be put back into the battle of flowers ?

advertisement look back at battle of flowers 1910 the jersey battle of flowers started life as a celebration of the coronation of kind edward vii in 1902 but was so popular it returned the following year .
in the early days of battle , floats were usually horse drawn and flowers were torn off at the end .
it was the practice of tearing and throwing flowers that gave the event the battle of flowers name .
now , 108 years after that first event , thousands still flock to jersey to watch the islands biggest annual event .
the 1910 battle included a float with a fairy tale theme the battle of flowers stopped during the wwi , starting up again in 1926 and again during the german occupation of the island - starting again in 1951 .
the early days of battle were similar in form to the spectacle that spans victoria avenue every august now - just a lot smaller .
newsreel footage from british pathe of the 1910 battle shows floats drawn by horses , led by small boys holding a road and floats covering in flowers , on float were girls in white surrounded by a gazebo .
there was also a flower covered castle tower with a fairy tale king in a big crown and long beard surrounded with little boys in sailor suits .
the largest ever crowd for battle - over 60,000 people - was in 1969 , it would never be as popular again .
battle veteran florence bechelet said that every hotel was full that year and a special boat was put on .
she said : " it would bring people in the morning and take them back at night .
it 's the best thing we have in the island . "
battle of flowers started in 1902 jersey 's economic development minister , senator alan maclean , said battle and other events need to find private sponsors to keep them alive .
he said : " events that need public funding need to be given some assistance in putting their proposition together as a package that will appeal to the private sector for corporate sponsorship purposes .
" i 'm absolutely convinced that there is opportunity there to raise more money to support these important events . "
the 2010 battle of flowers main parade is on thursday 12 august with the moonlight parade on friday 13 august .
it 's thought around 25,000 people will watch this years event .
have your say should the battle be put back into the battle of flowers ?
what do you think of the annual event ?

it was mullah omar 's backing for al-qaeda leader osama bin laden that brought the us-led campaign to oust the taliban .
he and most of the other senior taliban leaders , along with bin laden and some of his senior al-qaeda associates , survived the american onslaught .
mullah omar and most of his comrades have since evaded capture despite one of the largest manhunts in the world and are believed to be guiding the resurgent taliban .
us president barack obama 's special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan , richard holbrooke , has said he believes mullah omar is in hiding somewhere along the rugged border between the two countries .
others believe him to be in quetta or karachi , in pakistan , something officials in islamabad deny .
they say he is in afghanistan .
the arrest of the taliban 's second-in-command , mullah abdul ghani baradar , near karachi in january lends credence to the idea that other top afghan taliban leaders are in hiding in pakistan .
since 2001 the taliban have regrouped in both pakistan and afghanistan , but are now under pressure in both countries , from the pakistani army and nato respectively .
despite ever higher numbers of foreign troops , the taliban have steadily extended their influence , rendering vast tracts of afghanistan insecure , and violence in the country has returned to levels not seen since 2001 .
in a message e-mailed to journalists in 2009 and attributed to mullah omar , he urged taliban members to continue to fight against foreign military forces in afghanistan .
family ties mullah omar and bin laden go back to their time as resistance fighters against the soviet occupation of afghanistan of 1979 to 1989 .
mullah omar vigorously defended his friend against allegations that he masterminded the devastating attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , accusing the us of trying to cover up their own intelligence failures .
bin laden is believed to have at least partially financed the taliban takeover of afghanistan .
the ties may go further .
it was thought that mullah omar had taken bin laden 's eldest daughter as a wife , and that bin laden may even have taken one of mullah omar 's daughters as a fourth wife .
the taliban always denied this .
mullah omar was only a small-time commander in the forces resisting the soviet occupation .
he never did any practical field commanding during the taliban 's 1994-96 blitzkreig that culminated in their capture of kabul .
but the localised uprising that he led against former mujahideen warlords in the kandahar area in 1994 earned him wide respect and is regarded by some as a catalyst for the taliban movement that followed .
he emerged from the taliban takeover of afghanistan as their undisputed leader or " commander of the faithful " , a title with great resonance in islamic history kandahar house no western journalist has ever met mullah omar , who left virtually all contact with the outside world to his foreign minister , wakil ahmad mutawakkil .
to many ordinary afghans he is just a name , but those who have seen him say he would be about 50 - and tall , with a black beard and a black turban .
his right eye was damaged by shrapnel when he was fighting afghanistan 's soviet occupiers in the 1980s .
when the taliban were in power he rarely left the southern city of kandahar , where he lived in a large house that was reportedly built for him by bin laden .
the two were reported to have spoken daily by satellite telephone , and some reports suggested they also met for fishing trips .
bamiyan under mullah omar 's rule , a strict interpretation of islamic law was imposed on afghanistan under taliban control .
women were strongly discouraged from leaving their homes , denied schooling and jobs and forced to fully cover themselves .
women found guilty of adultery were stoned to death , homosexuals crushed under brick walls , thieves ' hands amputated and murderers publicly executed by victims ' families .
edicts from mullah omar included the death sentence for anyone converting to another religion , as well as the infamous orders to destroy the country 's ancient buddha statues at bamiyan .
the taliban 's fall from power was a far cry from the optimism that greeted their arrival in kabul in the mid-1990s , when many ordinary afghans welcomed them as heralding an end to the chaos caused by years of civil war .

local residents ed carlisle and mahboob nazir talked with bbc radio leeds 's alice bailey .
the south leeds area of beeston gained an unwanted nationwide reputation in 2005 with the revelation that it was home to several of the london bombers .
consisting mainly of terraced housing the area struggled to halt a gradual decline that started in the 1960s .
much closer community please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
in the interview ed who says " hand on heart i love beeston " explains how some people expected the area to implode following the events of 2005 but he asserts : " the community really pulled together .
we are a much closer community than we were five years ago . "
mahboob says , " beeston for me is a home where there 's a family , you have ups and downs .
good things happen , bad things happen but you learn to overcome them . "
mahboob also explains the shock he felt following the revelation of links between his home and the bombings .
he found it initially hard to believe what had happened .
urban sprawl beeston is just a couple of miles from leeds city centre and is home to leeds united 's elland road ground as well as the john charles centre for sport .
the name is mentioned in the domesday book of 1086 and grew into a mining village overlooking leeds , that was gradually surrounded by the city 's urban sprawl .
during world war ii beeston was on the receiving end of several air raids .
three main factors in the area ' decline between 1960 and the 1990s were highlighted in an overview by leeds city council . - the building of the m621 motorway through the heart of beeston and holbeck bisected the area and disconnected it from the city centre - the decline of manufacturing industries in and around the area , particularly in hunslet , led to the communities suffering significant levels of unemployment . - the housing stock needed replenishing .

let us know if you have a view on life in beeston leeds @ bbc.co.uk you say i was born in beeston in 1965 , my memories of the 70 's were good - i remember the army coming to cross flatts park for an exhibition-it was spectacular .
in the late 80s you could sense a drug / crime atmosphere creeping into the area , started to see strangers wandering about whereas before you seemed to recognise everyone .
people started to sell up and the new people were not usually from the area , before this time , people that sold their homes tended to upgrade to a better house but still stayed in beston. so by the end of the 80s if you had n't escaped beeston you were doomed to stay in an area without any community feel and were trapped with falling house prices .

local residents ed carlisle and mahboob nazir talked with bbc radio leeds 's alice bailey .
the south leeds area of beeston gained an unwanted nationwide reputation in 2005 with the revelation that it was home to several of the london bombers .

mahboob says , " beeston for me is a home where there 's a family , you have ups and downs .

mahboob also explains the shock he felt following the revelation of links between his home and the bombings .
he found it initially hard to believe what had happened .

they were called the cadet corps .
when the threat subsided , many of the groups turned into rifle clubs or social welfare organisations .
the army cadet force reformed in 1942 , and in 1957 it 's purpose changed from military back-up to a youth movement , backed by the ministry of defence .
