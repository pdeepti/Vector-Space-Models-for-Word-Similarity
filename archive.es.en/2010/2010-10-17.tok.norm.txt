party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers . attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have " utterly failed , " according to chancellor angela merkel . " this approach has failed , utterly failed , " said merkel , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a speech to the party 's young people 's association in potsdam on saturday .
she added that not enough was done in the past to support the movement . " the failures of the last 30 or 40 years can not be resolved so quickly , " she said . the comments followed a similar speech from horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu .
on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market .

the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany . turkish president abdullah gul told the sueddeutsche zeitung that turks living in germany should learn to speak fluent and accent-free german . filling the skilled-worker void on saturday , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a skilled worker shortage is hurting economic growth she pointed out that every year , 200,000 germans retired and left the job market , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .

" wherever it is possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 17.10.2010 german echo awards honor the year 's best in classical music großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conductor kurt masur is honored with a liftime achievement award now in its 16th year , germany 's echo klassik awards go out to musicians who are making waves in the music world .
this year 's winners include a conductor known for his social activism and the world 's fastest violinist . the echo klassik , germany 's most prestigious music prize , is to be awarded sunday evening in essen .
young stars are in the spotlight this year , like 28-year-old " pianist of the year " lang lang and 30-year-old violinist david garrett .
the prize can make a big difference in young musicians ' careers , said echo jurist stephanie haase from the record label emi classics .
" i regard this prize as being very significant , both in germany and internationally , " haase told deutsche welle .
" music event managers react positively when they see an echo prize in an artist 's biography , and winning artists are often able to secure concert engagements they would n't have gotten otherwise . "
but for lang lang , securing exciting concert invitations is not a challenge .
hailed in 2007 by the new york times as " the hottest artist on the classical music planet , " he routinely sells out concerts in cities across the world .
david garrett - who holds the guinness world record for being the fastest violinist - has also already enjoyed huge success with albums like his " classic romance " from december 2009 .
that album is this year 's winner in echo 's " bestseller of the year " category .
lifetime achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echo is a great career booster , though pianist lang lang hardly needs one but young artists are n't the only ones set to be honored on sunday .
eighty-three-year-old conductor kurt masur will receive the lifetime achievement award for decades of outstanding engagement both musically and socially .
in the last decade , masur has served as director for both the french national orchestra in paris and the london philharmonic orchestra .
prior to that , he was director of the new york philharmonic and became the first conductor to be awarded the title of conductor emeritus by the ensemble .
within germany , masur is celebrated for his role in the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that helped bring an end to communist east germany .
thanks to his prominent role as conductor of leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra , he was able to mediate between officials and demonstrators to help convince protestors to remain peaceful .
nonetheless , masur said in an interview this week with german magazine der spiegel that " the spirit of those days has pretty much been exhausted .
in fact , for many people , -lsb- german -rsb- reunification has meant more suffering than gain . "
alongside masur 's honor , estonian conductor paavo jarvi will also receive an award as the 2010 " conductor of the year . "
the grammy award-winner is currently the music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few in the industry are still clinging to the cd changes in the industry since its establishment in 1994 , the echo klassik prize has already seen significant developments in the music branch , including the move toward digitalization .
" ultimately , those of us in classical music are still mostly clinging to cds or even records , but we 've noticed that classical recordings are increasingly available online as digital downloads , " said dieter knoell from the association that awards the echo klassik prizes .
" two years ago , we gave an award to a project that made bach 's entire works available for the ipod . "
the market for classical music has grown within recent years , which has led to a 15-percent increase in the number of recordings submitted for consideration in this year 's echo klassik awards .

the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations . fifa is investigating claims that senior officials offered to sell their votes in the bidding race for the 2018 world cup .
the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations .
" fifa has already requested all the information and documents related to this matter and is awaiting to receive this material , " a statement from football 's world governing body said .
" in the meantime , fifa is not in a position to provide any further comments on this matter , " the statement added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , offered his vote for 570,000 euros , the newspaper said an undercover investigation by the british sunday times newspaper alleges that amos adamu , a nigerian member of the fifa executive committee , asked for $ 800,000 -lrb- 570,000 euros -rrb- to endorse one of the bid candidates .
the undercover journalists posed as lobbyists for a united states business consortium asking adamu to vote for the us bid in the 2018 event in return for cash .
the newspaper also said reynald temarii , a fifa vice-president and president of the oceania football confederation , wanted three million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.6 million euros -rrb- for a sports academy .
' best chance ' for bidding race offered by bribe any deals during the bidding process for a world cup are strictly forbidden under fifa 's rules , but the sunday times report said officials , past and present , told reporters that paying bribes offered their best chance of securing a successful bid .
the money requested by adamu , the president of the west african football union , was intended to pay for four artificial football pitches in nigeria , but he said it should be paid to him personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temarii wanted 1.6 million euros for his vote " certainly if you are to invest that , that means you also want the vote , " he is reported as saying , adding that the payments should be in two stages , half now and half after the vote on the world cup host country on december 2 .
gara gombe , a veteran football administrator in nigeria who has been a long-time critic of the nff , said the country should have its own independent investigation in the allegations .
" this is an embarrassment not only for amos adamu but also for the country as a whole , " gombe said .
england , russia , spain / portugal , or netherlands / belgium ?
the sunday times reported that adamu said he had already agreed with someone else to back a rival bid in the 2022 contest , which is also voted on december 2 , but agreed that the united states would be his second preference .
england is one of the front-runners to host the 2018 world cup but is up against strong competition from russia , spain-portugal and netherlands-belgium .

a canadian and four europeans were also given the honor . tens of thousands of people gathered at st peter 's square for sunday 's mass on sunday .
while many of the attendees were from the new saints ' countries of origin , the most attention was given to australia 's first saint , mary mackillop . at the canonization , pope benedict xvi told the crowd he commended mackillop for setting an example for educators through her work in the 19th century teaching the poor in rural australia . " for many years countless young people throughout australia have been blessed with teachers who were inspired by the courageous and saintly example of zeal , perseverance and prayer of mother mary mackillop , " benedict said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope celebrated mass at st. peter 's square mackillop was born in 1842 .
she started out on her own teaching poor children in australia , but when others joined her , she created a new order called the sisters of st. joseph of the sacred heart . in 1871 , she was briefly excommunicated from the church in a fight for control of her order and for denouncing a pedophile priest .
mackillop died in 1909 .
australian activists have said she should be named the patron of victims of sexual abuse by priests because she was punished for exposing it . at sunday 's ceremony at the vatican the pope also canonized two italian nuns , giulia salzano and battista camilla da varano , spanish nun candida maria de jesus cipitria y barriola , brother andre bessette of canada , and stanislaw kazimierczyk of poland .
he asked that " throughout the church they be honored devoutly among all the saints . " official delegations to the celebration included polish president bronislaw komorowski and australia 's foreign minister and former premier kevin rudd . komorowski had attended an audience with benedict on saturday during which the process of the beatification - a preliminary step towards canonization - for late pope john paul ii was discussed . author : matt zuvela -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 17.10.2010 german , french rail companies on collision course over channel tunnel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar wants german trains in the channel tunnel german rail operator deutsche bahn successfully ran evacuation tests with 300 volunteers on a high-speed siemens-built train in the channel tunnel .
the tests are a headache for the french government . a german-built train filled almost to capacity was rolled into the 50-kilometer -lrb- 31-mile -rrb- tunnel beneath the english channel on saturday night , where around 300 volunteers were evacuated following an alarm signal . the tests ran smoothly , a spokeswoman for the tunnel 's operator eurotunnel said sunday morning . the tests pose a problem for the french government and french firm alstom .
eurostar , the company with the monopoly on the cross-channel rail link between britain and france want to buy high-speed trains from deutsche bahn in order to increase the tunnel 's traffic capacity . last thursday , france 's transport minister insisted that eurostar can not buy german trains because only rolling stock made by alstom meets safety standards .
minister dominique bussereau dismissed an announcement by eurostar that it had ordered 10 high-speed velaro trains from german group siemens , a setback for french group alstom , as eu railways are opened up to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france believes it should be in the driver 's seat of channel tunnel trains " we have told the directors of eurotunnel and eurostar that equipment other than that currently made by alstom can not go in the tunnel , so eurostar 's decision is null and void , " bussereau told lci television . deutsche bahn has complained in the past of a lack of competition in the french rail sector , where domestic traffic is dominated by the state rail company sncf , and cross-channel services by eurostar in which sncf is the biggest shareholder with 55 percent . long trains or short trains ? an official at the transport ministry said separately , " the contract has not been signed and can not be signed as long as the safety conditions and clearance for the equipment have not been respected . "
the source added that it would take " about two years " of tests to determine whether siemens trains could run in the tunnel between england and france .
eurostar trains currently link london , paris and brussels . the row over train safety in the channel tunnel is centered on the length of the trains .
eurostar trains based on alstom 's tgv model are 400 meters -lrb- 1,300 feet -rrb- long and can be walked through from one end to the other , allowing escaping passengers the ability to exit near a safety tunnel . german operator deutsche bahn wants to run pairs of siemens 's 200-metre ice high-speed trains in tandem , while eurostar wants a new version designed to meet the 400-meter walk-through requirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice has plans to get in on the channel tunnel traffic deutsche bahn already made a test run of an ice-3 train in the tunnel last wednesday , the first non-eurostar passenger train ever to enter .
a source close to the matter told the afp news agency when the contract was announced that the order for siemens could be worth close to 600 million euros -lrb- $ 846 million -rrb- . maximizing capacity jacques gounon , head of eurotunnel , the company that owns and operates the tunnels themselves , said he is certain that the ice trains will pass all safety tests , proving that passengers in 200-meter trains are just as certain of reaching the emergency exits safely as those in 400-meter trains . eurotunnel has said the tunnels are only being run at capacity of 50 percent at the moment .
if the german trains pass all the tests , the french government could face accusations of protectionism . author : ben knight -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers . attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have " utterly failed , " according to chancellor angela merkel . " this approach has failed , utterly failed , " said merkel , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a speech to the party 's young people 's association in potsdam on saturday .
she added that not enough was done in the past to support the movement . " the failures of the last 30 or 40 years can not be resolved so quickly , " she said . the comments followed a similar speech from horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu .
on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market . " those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said . merkel 's comments come a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany . turkish president abdullah gul told the sueddeutsche zeitung that turks living in germany should learn to speak fluent and accent-free german . filling the skilled-worker void on saturday , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a skilled worker shortage is hurting economic growth she pointed out that every year , 200,000 germans retired and left the job market , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy . " for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever it is possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
german education minister annette schavan agreed , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper germany should be more concerned with emigration than immigration and adding that her ministry was preparing a bill that would make it easier for foreign qualifications to be recognized in germany . germany 's integration debate is sure to continue as president christian wulff , who in a speech marking 20 years of german unity said islam was now a part of germany , begins a five-day trip to turkey on monday .

a canadian and four europeans were also given the honor . tens of thousands of people gathered at st peter 's square for sunday 's mass on sunday .
while many of the attendees were from the new saints ' countries of origin , the most attention was given to australia 's first saint , mary mackillop . at the canonization , pope benedict xvi told the crowd he commended mackillop for setting an example for educators through her work in the 19th century teaching the poor in rural australia .

she started out on her own teaching poor children in australia , but when others joined her , she created a new order called the sisters of st. joseph of the sacred heart . in 1871 , she was briefly excommunicated from the church in a fight for control of her order and for denouncing a pedophile priest .
mackillop died in 1909 .
australian activists have said she should be named the patron of victims of sexual abuse by priests because she was punished for exposing it . at sunday 's ceremony at the vatican the pope also canonized two italian nuns , giulia salzano and battista camilla da varano , spanish nun candida maria de jesus cipitria y barriola , brother andre bessette of canada , and stanislaw kazimierczyk of poland .

party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers . attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have " utterly failed , " according to chancellor angela merkel . " this approach has failed , utterly failed , " said merkel , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a speech to the party 's young people 's association in potsdam on saturday .
she added that not enough was done in the past to support the movement . " the failures of the last 30 or 40 years can not be resolved so quickly , " she said . the comments followed a similar speech from horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu .
on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market . " those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said . merkel 's comments come a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany . turkish president abdullah gul told the sueddeutsche zeitung that turks living in germany should learn to speak fluent and accent-free german . filling the skilled-worker void on saturday , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a skilled worker shortage is hurting economic growth she pointed out that every year , 200,000 germans retired and left the job market , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy . " for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever it is possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
german education minister annette schavan agreed , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper germany should be more concerned with emigration than immigration and adding that her ministry was preparing a bill that would make it easier for foreign qualifications to be recognized in germany . germany 's integration debate is sure to continue as president christian wulff , who in a speech marking 20 years of german unity said islam was now a part of germany , begins a five-day trip to turkey on monday .

the tests are a headache for the french government . a german-built train filled almost to capacity was rolled into the 50-kilometer -lrb- 31-mile -rrb- tunnel beneath the english channel on saturday night , where around 300 volunteers were evacuated following an alarm signal . the tests ran smoothly , a spokeswoman for the tunnel 's operator eurotunnel said sunday morning . the tests pose a problem for the french government and french firm alstom .
eurostar , the company with the monopoly on the cross-channel rail link between britain and france want to buy high-speed trains from deutsche bahn in order to increase the tunnel 's traffic capacity . last thursday , france 's transport minister insisted that eurostar can not buy german trains because only rolling stock made by alstom meets safety standards .
minister dominique bussereau dismissed an announcement by eurostar that it had ordered 10 high-speed velaro trains from german group siemens , a setback for french group alstom , as eu railways are opened up to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france believes it should be in the driver 's seat of channel tunnel trains " we have told the directors of eurotunnel and eurostar that equipment other than that currently made by alstom can not go in the tunnel , so eurostar 's decision is null and void , " bussereau told lci television . deutsche bahn has complained in the past of a lack of competition in the french rail sector , where domestic traffic is dominated by the state rail company sncf , and cross-channel services by eurostar in which sncf is the biggest shareholder with 55 percent . long trains or short trains ? an official at the transport ministry said separately , " the contract has not been signed and can not be signed as long as the safety conditions and clearance for the equipment have not been respected . "
the source added that it would take " about two years " of tests to determine whether siemens trains could run in the tunnel between england and france .
eurostar trains currently link london , paris and brussels . the row over train safety in the channel tunnel is centered on the length of the trains .
eurostar trains based on alstom 's tgv model are 400 meters -lrb- 1,300 feet -rrb- long and can be walked through from one end to the other , allowing escaping passengers the ability to exit near a safety tunnel . german operator deutsche bahn wants to run pairs of siemens 's 200-metre ice high-speed trains in tandem , while eurostar wants a new version designed to meet the 400-meter walk-through requirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice has plans to get in on the channel tunnel traffic deutsche bahn already made a test run of an ice-3 train in the tunnel last wednesday , the first non-eurostar passenger train ever to enter .
a source close to the matter told the afp news agency when the contract was announced that the order for siemens could be worth close to 600 million euros -lrb- $ 846 million -rrb- . maximizing capacity jacques gounon , head of eurotunnel , the company that owns and operates the tunnels themselves , said he is certain that the ice trains will pass all safety tests , proving that passengers in 200-meter trains are just as certain of reaching the emergency exits safely as those in 400-meter trains . eurotunnel has said the tunnels are only being run at capacity of 50 percent at the moment .

he 's selling them as mini-heaters , whose side-effect happens to produce light . siegfried rotthaeuser and his brother-in-law have found a way to skirt around an eu ban on incandescent light bulbs brighter than 60 watts by importing them from china and selling them as " small heating devices " called " heatballs . " the mechanical engineer from the city of essen began marketing 75 and 100 watt bulbs as mini-heaters since he calculated that just 5 percent of the energy they use creates light while the other 95 percent is turned to heat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was pleased at having to change light bulbs according to the sales website heatball.de , the devices are " the best invention since the light bulb " and are " technically very similar to the classic light bulb except they are not made to produce light but rather heat . " at a price of 1.69 euros -lrb- $ 2.38 -rrb- each , rotthaeuser sold the first batch of 4,000 in three days . describing the bulbs ' sale as " action art , " the website questions whether changing to mercury-containing compact fluorescent light bulbs would really improve the state of the plant for generations to come .
the site , however , says that 30 cents of each sale are donated to projects to protect rainforests . in efforts to encourage energy efficiency , the european union is progressively phasing out the sale of incandescent light bulbs .

on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .

" for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down .

on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market . " those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said . merkel 's comments come a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany . turkish president abdullah gul told the sueddeutsche zeitung that turks living in germany should learn to speak fluent and accent-free german . filling the skilled-worker void on saturday , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a skilled worker shortage is hurting economic growth she pointed out that every year , 200,000 germans retired and left the job market , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy . " for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever it is possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
german education minister annette schavan agreed , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper germany should be more concerned with emigration than immigration and adding that her ministry was preparing a bill that would make it easier for foreign qualifications to be recognized in germany . germany 's integration debate is sure to continue as president christian wulff , who in a speech marking 20 years of german unity said islam was now a part of germany , begins a five-day trip to turkey on monday .

the tests are a headache for the french government . a german-built train filled almost to capacity was rolled into the 50-kilometer -lrb- 31-mile -rrb- tunnel beneath the english channel on saturday night , where around 300 volunteers were evacuated following an alarm signal . the tests ran smoothly , a spokeswoman for the tunnel 's operator eurotunnel said sunday morning . the tests pose a problem for the french government and french firm alstom .
eurostar , the company with the monopoly on the cross-channel rail link between britain and france want to buy high-speed trains from deutsche bahn in order to increase the tunnel 's traffic capacity . last thursday , france 's transport minister insisted that eurostar can not buy german trains because only rolling stock made by alstom meets safety standards .
minister dominique bussereau dismissed an announcement by eurostar that it had ordered 10 high-speed velaro trains from german group siemens , a setback for french group alstom , as eu railways are opened up to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france believes it should be in the driver 's seat of channel tunnel trains " we have told the directors of eurotunnel and eurostar that equipment other than that currently made by alstom can not go in the tunnel , so eurostar 's decision is null and void , " bussereau told lci television . deutsche bahn has complained in the past of a lack of competition in the french rail sector , where domestic traffic is dominated by the state rail company sncf , and cross-channel services by eurostar in which sncf is the biggest shareholder with 55 percent . long trains or short trains ? an official at the transport ministry said separately , " the contract has not been signed and can not be signed as long as the safety conditions and clearance for the equipment have not been respected . "
the source added that it would take " about two years " of tests to determine whether siemens trains could run in the tunnel between england and france .
eurostar trains currently link london , paris and brussels . the row over train safety in the channel tunnel is centered on the length of the trains .
eurostar trains based on alstom 's tgv model are 400 meters -lrb- 1,300 feet -rrb- long and can be walked through from one end to the other , allowing escaping passengers the ability to exit near a safety tunnel . german operator deutsche bahn wants to run pairs of siemens 's 200-metre ice high-speed trains in tandem , while eurostar wants a new version designed to meet the 400-meter walk-through requirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice has plans to get in on the channel tunnel traffic deutsche bahn already made a test run of an ice-3 train in the tunnel last wednesday , the first non-eurostar passenger train ever to enter .
a source close to the matter told the afp news agency when the contract was announced that the order for siemens could be worth close to 600 million euros -lrb- $ 846 million -rrb- . maximizing capacity jacques gounon , head of eurotunnel , the company that owns and operates the tunnels themselves , said he is certain that the ice trains will pass all safety tests , proving that passengers in 200-meter trains are just as certain of reaching the emergency exits safely as those in 400-meter trains . eurotunnel has said the tunnels are only being run at capacity of 50 percent at the moment .
if the german trains pass all the tests , the french government could face accusations of protectionism . author : ben knight -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while many of the attendees were from the new saints ' countries of origin , the most attention was given to australia 's first saint , mary mackillop . at the canonization , pope benedict xvi told the crowd he commended mackillop for setting an example for educators through her work in the 19th century teaching the poor in rural australia .

mackillop died in 1909 .

"
" there is no other path to independence other than those that follow the peaceful and democratic paths , " he told the newspaper .
" weapons , all weapons , should disappear definitively from the basque political equation , " he added .
otega , who was jailed for two years in march for " glorifying " terrorism in remarks he made at a 2005 rally , said eta was not likely to resort to violence as it had announced " the end of armed action .
" but if these incidents resume -lrb- batasuna -rrb- ... will oppose them , " he said .
zapatero : ' actions count ' batasuna was outlawed in 2003 for its links with eta , which is held responsible for nearly 830 deaths in a 41-year campaign for independence for the basque country of northern spain and southwestern france .
asked about otegi 's interview at a rally of his socialist party in the northern town of ponferrada , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said his government had no plans to allow batasuna to stand in the elections .
" these words are better than others , but what counts are actions , " he said .
on september 5 , eta said it had decided to halt " armed offensive actions " but did not say if this truce was temporary or permanent .

this year 's winners include a conductor known for his social activism and the world 's fastest violinist . the echo klassik , germany 's most prestigious music prize , is to be awarded sunday evening in essen .
young stars are in the spotlight this year , like 28-year-old " pianist of the year " lang lang and 30-year-old violinist david garrett .
the prize can make a big difference in young musicians ' careers , said echo jurist stephanie haase from the record label emi classics .
" i regard this prize as being very significant , both in germany and internationally , " haase told deutsche welle .
" music event managers react positively when they see an echo prize in an artist 's biography , and winning artists are often able to secure concert engagements they would n't have gotten otherwise . "
but for lang lang , securing exciting concert invitations is not a challenge .
hailed in 2007 by the new york times as " the hottest artist on the classical music planet , " he routinely sells out concerts in cities across the world .
david garrett - who holds the guinness world record for being the fastest violinist - has also already enjoyed huge success with albums like his " classic romance " from december 2009 .

eighty-three-year-old conductor kurt masur will receive the lifetime achievement award for decades of outstanding engagement both musically and socially .
in the last decade , masur has served as director for both the french national orchestra in paris and the london philharmonic orchestra .
prior to that , he was director of the new york philharmonic and became the first conductor to be awarded the title of conductor emeritus by the ensemble .
within germany , masur is celebrated for his role in the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that helped bring an end to communist east germany .
thanks to his prominent role as conductor of leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra , he was able to mediate between officials and demonstrators to help convince protestors to remain peaceful .
nonetheless , masur said in an interview this week with german magazine der spiegel that " the spirit of those days has pretty much been exhausted .
in fact , for many people , -lsb- german -rsb- reunification has meant more suffering than gain . "
alongside masur 's honor , estonian conductor paavo jarvi will also receive an award as the 2010 " conductor of the year . "
the grammy award-winner is currently the music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen .

" two years ago , we gave an award to a project that made bach 's entire works available for the ipod . "
the market for classical music has grown within recent years , which has led to a 15-percent increase in the number of recordings submitted for consideration in this year 's echo klassik awards .
this year 's total number of nominees was 570 .
artists like lang lang and david garrett have helped draw younger artists to classical music , as has star tenor jonas kaufmann .
kaufmann is the 2010 echo winner for " male singer of the year , " while american mezzo-soprano joyce didonato was honored as " female singer of the year . "
the awards are officially presented sunday , though the winners were announced in july following deliberation by an 11-member jury consisting of music journalists , producers , pr agents and other music industry representatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 17.10.2010 german echo awards honor the year 's best in classical music großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conductor kurt masur is honored with a liftime achievement award now in its 16th year , germany 's echo klassik awards go out to musicians who are making waves in the music world .
this year 's winners include a conductor known for his social activism and the world 's fastest violinist . the echo klassik , germany 's most prestigious music prize , is to be awarded sunday evening in essen .
young stars are in the spotlight this year , like 28-year-old " pianist of the year " lang lang and 30-year-old violinist david garrett .
the prize can make a big difference in young musicians ' careers , said echo jurist stephanie haase from the record label emi classics .
" i regard this prize as being very significant , both in germany and internationally , " haase told deutsche welle .
" music event managers react positively when they see an echo prize in an artist 's biography , and winning artists are often able to secure concert engagements they would n't have gotten otherwise . "
but for lang lang , securing exciting concert invitations is not a challenge .
hailed in 2007 by the new york times as " the hottest artist on the classical music planet , " he routinely sells out concerts in cities across the world .
david garrett - who holds the guinness world record for being the fastest violinist - has also already enjoyed huge success with albums like his " classic romance " from december 2009 .
that album is this year 's winner in echo 's " bestseller of the year " category .
lifetime achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echo is a great career booster , though pianist lang lang hardly needs one but young artists are n't the only ones set to be honored on sunday .
eighty-three-year-old conductor kurt masur will receive the lifetime achievement award for decades of outstanding engagement both musically and socially .
in the last decade , masur has served as director for both the french national orchestra in paris and the london philharmonic orchestra .
prior to that , he was director of the new york philharmonic and became the first conductor to be awarded the title of conductor emeritus by the ensemble .
within germany , masur is celebrated for his role in the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that helped bring an end to communist east germany .
thanks to his prominent role as conductor of leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra , he was able to mediate between officials and demonstrators to help convince protestors to remain peaceful .
nonetheless , masur said in an interview this week with german magazine der spiegel that " the spirit of those days has pretty much been exhausted .
in fact , for many people , -lsb- german -rsb- reunification has meant more suffering than gain . "
alongside masur 's honor , estonian conductor paavo jarvi will also receive an award as the 2010 " conductor of the year . "
the grammy award-winner is currently the music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few in the industry are still clinging to the cd changes in the industry since its establishment in 1994 , the echo klassik prize has already seen significant developments in the music branch , including the move toward digitalization .
" ultimately , those of us in classical music are still mostly clinging to cds or even records , but we 've noticed that classical recordings are increasingly available online as digital downloads , " said dieter knoell from the association that awards the echo klassik prizes .
" two years ago , we gave an award to a project that made bach 's entire works available for the ipod . "
the market for classical music has grown within recent years , which has led to a 15-percent increase in the number of recordings submitted for consideration in this year 's echo klassik awards .
this year 's total number of nominees was 570 .
artists like lang lang and david garrett have helped draw younger artists to classical music , as has star tenor jonas kaufmann .
kaufmann is the 2010 echo winner for " male singer of the year , " while american mezzo-soprano joyce didonato was honored as " female singer of the year . "

the tests are a headache for the french government . a german-built train filled almost to capacity was rolled into the 50-kilometer -lrb- 31-mile -rrb- tunnel beneath the english channel on saturday night , where around 300 volunteers were evacuated following an alarm signal . the tests ran smoothly , a spokeswoman for the tunnel 's operator eurotunnel said sunday morning . the tests pose a problem for the french government and french firm alstom .
eurostar , the company with the monopoly on the cross-channel rail link between britain and france want to buy high-speed trains from deutsche bahn in order to increase the tunnel 's traffic capacity . last thursday , france 's transport minister insisted that eurostar can not buy german trains because only rolling stock made by alstom meets safety standards .

party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers . attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have " utterly failed , " according to chancellor angela merkel . " this approach has failed , utterly failed , " said merkel , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a speech to the party 's young people 's association in potsdam on saturday .
she added that not enough was done in the past to support the movement . " the failures of the last 30 or 40 years can not be resolved so quickly , " she said . the comments followed a similar speech from horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu .
on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market . " those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said . merkel 's comments come a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany . turkish president abdullah gul told the sueddeutsche zeitung that turks living in germany should learn to speak fluent and accent-free german . filling the skilled-worker void on saturday , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a skilled worker shortage is hurting economic growth she pointed out that every year , 200,000 germans retired and left the job market , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy . " for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever it is possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
german education minister annette schavan agreed , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper germany should be more concerned with emigration than immigration and adding that her ministry was preparing a bill that would make it easier for foreign qualifications to be recognized in germany . germany 's integration debate is sure to continue as president christian wulff , who in a speech marking 20 years of german unity said islam was now a part of germany , begins a five-day trip to turkey on monday .

the tests are a headache for the french government . a german-built train filled almost to capacity was rolled into the 50-kilometer -lrb- 31-mile -rrb- tunnel beneath the english channel on saturday night , where around 300 volunteers were evacuated following an alarm signal . the tests ran smoothly , a spokeswoman for the tunnel 's operator eurotunnel said sunday morning . the tests pose a problem for the french government and french firm alstom .
eurostar , the company with the monopoly on the cross-channel rail link between britain and france want to buy high-speed trains from deutsche bahn in order to increase the tunnel 's traffic capacity . last thursday , france 's transport minister insisted that eurostar can not buy german trains because only rolling stock made by alstom meets safety standards .

"
the source added that it would take " about two years " of tests to determine whether siemens trains could run in the tunnel between england and france .
eurostar trains currently link london , paris and brussels . the row over train safety in the channel tunnel is centered on the length of the trains .
eurostar trains based on alstom 's tgv model are 400 meters -lrb- 1,300 feet -rrb- long and can be walked through from one end to the other , allowing escaping passengers the ability to exit near a safety tunnel . german operator deutsche bahn wants to run pairs of siemens 's 200-metre ice high-speed trains in tandem , while eurostar wants a new version designed to meet the 400-meter walk-through requirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice has plans to get in on the channel tunnel traffic deutsche bahn already made a test run of an ice-3 train in the tunnel last wednesday , the first non-eurostar passenger train ever to enter .
a source close to the matter told the afp news agency when the contract was announced that the order for siemens could be worth close to 600 million euros -lrb- $ 846 million -rrb- . maximizing capacity jacques gounon , head of eurotunnel , the company that owns and operates the tunnels themselves , said he is certain that the ice trains will pass all safety tests , proving that passengers in 200-meter trains are just as certain of reaching the emergency exits safely as those in 400-meter trains . eurotunnel has said the tunnels are only being run at capacity of 50 percent at the moment .

the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations . fifa is investigating claims that senior officials offered to sell their votes in the bidding race for the 2018 world cup .
the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations .
" fifa has already requested all the information and documents related to this matter and is awaiting to receive this material , " a statement from football 's world governing body said .
" in the meantime , fifa is not in a position to provide any further comments on this matter , " the statement added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , offered his vote for 570,000 euros , the newspaper said an undercover investigation by the british sunday times newspaper alleges that amos adamu , a nigerian member of the fifa executive committee , asked for $ 800,000 -lrb- 570,000 euros -rrb- to endorse one of the bid candidates .
the undercover journalists posed as lobbyists for a united states business consortium asking adamu to vote for the us bid in the 2018 event in return for cash .
the newspaper also said reynald temarii , a fifa vice-president and president of the oceania football confederation , wanted three million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.6 million euros -rrb- for a sports academy .
' best chance ' for bidding race offered by bribe any deals during the bidding process for a world cup are strictly forbidden under fifa 's rules , but the sunday times report said officials , past and present , told reporters that paying bribes offered their best chance of securing a successful bid .
the money requested by adamu , the president of the west african football union , was intended to pay for four artificial football pitches in nigeria , but he said it should be paid to him personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temarii wanted 1.6 million euros for his vote " certainly if you are to invest that , that means you also want the vote , " he is reported as saying , adding that the payments should be in two stages , half now and half after the vote on the world cup host country on december 2 .
gara gombe , a veteran football administrator in nigeria who has been a long-time critic of the nff , said the country should have its own independent investigation in the allegations .
" this is an embarrassment not only for amos adamu but also for the country as a whole , " gombe said .
england , russia , spain / portugal , or netherlands / belgium ?
the sunday times reported that adamu said he had already agreed with someone else to back a rival bid in the 2022 contest , which is also voted on december 2 , but agreed that the united states would be his second preference .
england is one of the front-runners to host the 2018 world cup but is up against strong competition from russia , spain-portugal and netherlands-belgium .

mackillop died in 1909 .
australian activists have said she should be named the patron of victims of sexual abuse by priests because she was punished for exposing it . at sunday 's ceremony at the vatican the pope also canonized two italian nuns , giulia salzano and battista camilla da varano , spanish nun candida maria de jesus cipitria y barriola , brother andre bessette of canada , and stanislaw kazimierczyk of poland .
he asked that " throughout the church they be honored devoutly among all the saints .

party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers . attempts to build a multicultural society in germany have " utterly failed , " according to chancellor angela merkel . " this approach has failed , utterly failed , " said merkel , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , in a speech to the party 's young people 's association in potsdam on saturday .
she added that not enough was done in the past to support the movement . " the failures of the last 30 or 40 years can not be resolved so quickly , " she said . the comments followed a similar speech from horst seehofer , head of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the csu .
on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market . " those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said . merkel 's comments come a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany . turkish president abdullah gul told the sueddeutsche zeitung that turks living in germany should learn to speak fluent and accent-free german . filling the skilled-worker void on saturday , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a skilled worker shortage is hurting economic growth she pointed out that every year , 200,000 germans retired and left the job market , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy . " for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever it is possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
german education minister annette schavan agreed , telling the welt am sonntag newspaper germany should be more concerned with emigration than immigration and adding that her ministry was preparing a bill that would make it easier for foreign qualifications to be recognized in germany . germany 's integration debate is sure to continue as president christian wulff , who in a speech marking 20 years of german unity said islam was now a part of germany , begins a five-day trip to turkey on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 17.10.2010 german echo awards honor the year 's best in classical music großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conductor kurt masur is honored with a liftime achievement award now in its 16th year , germany 's echo klassik awards go out to musicians who are making waves in the music world .
this year 's winners include a conductor known for his social activism and the world 's fastest violinist . the echo klassik , germany 's most prestigious music prize , is to be awarded sunday evening in essen .
young stars are in the spotlight this year , like 28-year-old " pianist of the year " lang lang and 30-year-old violinist david garrett .
the prize can make a big difference in young musicians ' careers , said echo jurist stephanie haase from the record label emi classics .
" i regard this prize as being very significant , both in germany and internationally , " haase told deutsche welle .
" music event managers react positively when they see an echo prize in an artist 's biography , and winning artists are often able to secure concert engagements they would n't have gotten otherwise . "
but for lang lang , securing exciting concert invitations is not a challenge .
hailed in 2007 by the new york times as " the hottest artist on the classical music planet , " he routinely sells out concerts in cities across the world .
david garrett - who holds the guinness world record for being the fastest violinist - has also already enjoyed huge success with albums like his " classic romance " from december 2009 .
that album is this year 's winner in echo 's " bestseller of the year " category .
lifetime achievement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the echo is a great career booster , though pianist lang lang hardly needs one but young artists are n't the only ones set to be honored on sunday .
eighty-three-year-old conductor kurt masur will receive the lifetime achievement award for decades of outstanding engagement both musically and socially .
in the last decade , masur has served as director for both the french national orchestra in paris and the london philharmonic orchestra .
prior to that , he was director of the new york philharmonic and became the first conductor to be awarded the title of conductor emeritus by the ensemble .
within germany , masur is celebrated for his role in the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 that helped bring an end to communist east germany .
thanks to his prominent role as conductor of leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra , he was able to mediate between officials and demonstrators to help convince protestors to remain peaceful .
nonetheless , masur said in an interview this week with german magazine der spiegel that " the spirit of those days has pretty much been exhausted .
in fact , for many people , -lsb- german -rsb- reunification has meant more suffering than gain . "
alongside masur 's honor , estonian conductor paavo jarvi will also receive an award as the 2010 " conductor of the year . "
the grammy award-winner is currently the music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few in the industry are still clinging to the cd changes in the industry since its establishment in 1994 , the echo klassik prize has already seen significant developments in the music branch , including the move toward digitalization .
" ultimately , those of us in classical music are still mostly clinging to cds or even records , but we 've noticed that classical recordings are increasingly available online as digital downloads , " said dieter knoell from the association that awards the echo klassik prizes .
" two years ago , we gave an award to a project that made bach 's entire works available for the ipod . "
the market for classical music has grown within recent years , which has led to a 15-percent increase in the number of recordings submitted for consideration in this year 's echo klassik awards .
this year 's total number of nominees was 570 .
artists like lang lang and david garrett have helped draw younger artists to classical music , as has star tenor jonas kaufmann .
kaufmann is the 2010 echo winner for " male singer of the year , " while american mezzo-soprano joyce didonato was honored as " female singer of the year . "
the awards are officially presented sunday , though the winners were announced in july following deliberation by an 11-member jury consisting of music journalists , producers , pr agents and other music industry representatives .

the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations . fifa is investigating claims that senior officials offered to sell their votes in the bidding race for the 2018 world cup .
the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations .
" fifa has already requested all the information and documents related to this matter and is awaiting to receive this material , " a statement from football 's world governing body said .
" in the meantime , fifa is not in a position to provide any further comments on this matter , " the statement added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , offered his vote for 570,000 euros , the newspaper said an undercover investigation by the british sunday times newspaper alleges that amos adamu , a nigerian member of the fifa executive committee , asked for $ 800,000 -lrb- 570,000 euros -rrb- to endorse one of the bid candidates .
the undercover journalists posed as lobbyists for a united states business consortium asking adamu to vote for the us bid in the 2018 event in return for cash .
the newspaper also said reynald temarii , a fifa vice-president and president of the oceania football confederation , wanted three million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.6 million euros -rrb- for a sports academy .
' best chance ' for bidding race offered by bribe any deals during the bidding process for a world cup are strictly forbidden under fifa 's rules , but the sunday times report said officials , past and present , told reporters that paying bribes offered their best chance of securing a successful bid .
the money requested by adamu , the president of the west african football union , was intended to pay for four artificial football pitches in nigeria , but he said it should be paid to him personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temarii wanted 1.6 million euros for his vote " certainly if you are to invest that , that means you also want the vote , " he is reported as saying , adding that the payments should be in two stages , half now and half after the vote on the world cup host country on december 2 .
gara gombe , a veteran football administrator in nigeria who has been a long-time critic of the nff , said the country should have its own independent investigation in the allegations .
" this is an embarrassment not only for amos adamu but also for the country as a whole , " gombe said .
england , russia , spain / portugal , or netherlands / belgium ?
the sunday times reported that adamu said he had already agreed with someone else to back a rival bid in the 2022 contest , which is also voted on december 2 , but agreed that the united states would be his second preference .
england is one of the front-runners to host the 2018 world cup but is up against strong competition from russia , spain-portugal and netherlands-belgium .

the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations . fifa is investigating claims that senior officials offered to sell their votes in the bidding race for the 2018 world cup .
the allegations implicate delegates from the african and oceania confederations .
" fifa has already requested all the information and documents related to this matter and is awaiting to receive this material , " a statement from football 's world governing body said .
" in the meantime , fifa is not in a position to provide any further comments on this matter , " the statement added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , offered his vote for 570,000 euros , the newspaper said an undercover investigation by the british sunday times newspaper alleges that amos adamu , a nigerian member of the fifa executive committee , asked for $ 800,000 -lrb- 570,000 euros -rrb- to endorse one of the bid candidates .
the undercover journalists posed as lobbyists for a united states business consortium asking adamu to vote for the us bid in the 2018 event in return for cash .
the newspaper also said reynald temarii , a fifa vice-president and president of the oceania football confederation , wanted three million new zealand dollars -lrb- 1.6 million euros -rrb- for a sports academy .
' best chance ' for bidding race offered by bribe any deals during the bidding process for a world cup are strictly forbidden under fifa 's rules , but the sunday times report said officials , past and present , told reporters that paying bribes offered their best chance of securing a successful bid .
the money requested by adamu , the president of the west african football union , was intended to pay for four artificial football pitches in nigeria , but he said it should be paid to him personally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temarii wanted 1.6 million euros for his vote " certainly if you are to invest that , that means you also want the vote , " he is reported as saying , adding that the payments should be in two stages , half now and half after the vote on the world cup host country on december 2 .
gara gombe , a veteran football administrator in nigeria who has been a long-time critic of the nff , said the country should have its own independent investigation in the allegations .
" this is an embarrassment not only for amos adamu but also for the country as a whole , " gombe said .
england , russia , spain / portugal , or netherlands / belgium ?
the sunday times reported that adamu said he had already agreed with someone else to back a rival bid in the 2022 contest , which is also voted on december 2 , but agreed that the united states would be his second preference .
england is one of the front-runners to host the 2018 world cup but is up against strong competition from russia , spain-portugal and netherlands-belgium .

a canadian and four europeans were also given the honor . tens of thousands of people gathered at st peter 's square for sunday 's mass on sunday .
while many of the attendees were from the new saints ' countries of origin , the most attention was given to australia 's first saint , mary mackillop . at the canonization , pope benedict xvi told the crowd he commended mackillop for setting an example for educators through her work in the 19th century teaching the poor in rural australia .

mackillop died in 1909 .
australian activists have said she should be named the patron of victims of sexual abuse by priests because she was punished for exposing it . at sunday 's ceremony at the vatican the pope also canonized two italian nuns , giulia salzano and battista camilla da varano , spanish nun candida maria de jesus cipitria y barriola , brother andre bessette of canada , and stanislaw kazimierczyk of poland .

the tests are a headache for the french government . a german-built train filled almost to capacity was rolled into the 50-kilometer -lrb- 31-mile -rrb- tunnel beneath the english channel on saturday night , where around 300 volunteers were evacuated following an alarm signal . the tests ran smoothly , a spokeswoman for the tunnel 's operator eurotunnel said sunday morning . the tests pose a problem for the french government and french firm alstom .
eurostar , the company with the monopoly on the cross-channel rail link between britain and france want to buy high-speed trains from deutsche bahn in order to increase the tunnel 's traffic capacity . last thursday , france 's transport minister insisted that eurostar can not buy german trains because only rolling stock made by alstom meets safety standards .
minister dominique bussereau dismissed an announcement by eurostar that it had ordered 10 high-speed velaro trains from german group siemens , a setback for french group alstom , as eu railways are opened up to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france believes it should be in the driver 's seat of channel tunnel trains " we have told the directors of eurotunnel and eurostar that equipment other than that currently made by alstom can not go in the tunnel , so eurostar 's decision is null and void , " bussereau told lci television . deutsche bahn has complained in the past of a lack of competition in the french rail sector , where domestic traffic is dominated by the state rail company sncf , and cross-channel services by eurostar in which sncf is the biggest shareholder with 55 percent . long trains or short trains ? an official at the transport ministry said separately , " the contract has not been signed and can not be signed as long as the safety conditions and clearance for the equipment have not been respected . "
the source added that it would take " about two years " of tests to determine whether siemens trains could run in the tunnel between england and france .
eurostar trains currently link london , paris and brussels . the row over train safety in the channel tunnel is centered on the length of the trains .
eurostar trains based on alstom 's tgv model are 400 meters -lrb- 1,300 feet -rrb- long and can be walked through from one end to the other , allowing escaping passengers the ability to exit near a safety tunnel . german operator deutsche bahn wants to run pairs of siemens 's 200-metre ice high-speed trains in tandem , while eurostar wants a new version designed to meet the 400-meter walk-through requirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice has plans to get in on the channel tunnel traffic deutsche bahn already made a test run of an ice-3 train in the tunnel last wednesday , the first non-eurostar passenger train ever to enter .
a source close to the matter told the afp news agency when the contract was announced that the order for siemens could be worth close to 600 million euros -lrb- $ 846 million -rrb- . maximizing capacity jacques gounon , head of eurotunnel , the company that owns and operates the tunnels themselves , said he is certain that the ice trains will pass all safety tests , proving that passengers in 200-meter trains are just as certain of reaching the emergency exits safely as those in 400-meter trains . eurotunnel has said the tunnels are only being run at capacity of 50 percent at the moment .

a source close to the matter told the afp news agency when the contract was announced that the order for siemens could be worth close to 600 million euros -lrb- $ 846 million -rrb- . maximizing capacity jacques gounon , head of eurotunnel , the company that owns and operates the tunnels themselves , said he is certain that the ice trains will pass all safety tests , proving that passengers in 200-meter trains are just as certain of reaching the emergency exits safely as those in 400-meter trains . eurotunnel has said the tunnels are only being run at capacity of 50 percent at the moment .

a canadian and four europeans were also given the honor . tens of thousands of people gathered at st peter 's square for sunday 's mass on sunday .
while many of the attendees were from the new saints ' countries of origin , the most attention was given to australia 's first saint , mary mackillop . at the canonization , pope benedict xvi told the crowd he commended mackillop for setting an example for educators through her work in the 19th century teaching the poor in rural australia .

mackillop died in 1909 .
australian activists have said she should be named the patron of victims of sexual abuse by priests because she was punished for exposing it . at sunday 's ceremony at the vatican the pope also canonized two italian nuns , giulia salzano and battista camilla da varano , spanish nun candida maria de jesus cipitria y barriola , brother andre bessette of canada , and stanislaw kazimierczyk of poland .

on friday he declared his party 's stance against multiculturalism : " multiculturalism is dead , " he said , to delegates ' applause . seehofer 's comments were criticized by stephan kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews .
in an interview with the rheinpfalz am sonntag newspaper , he said the idea that immigrants from turkey as well as arab countries found it harder to integrate was " not just tactless , but downright irresponsible . " german-speaking migrants still welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's comments were met with great support in her speech , merkel stressed that immigrants must learn to speak german in order to be able to compete on the job market .

the german chamber of industry and commerce has said germany 's shortfall of about 400,000 skilled workers costs the country 1 percent in growth annually . merkel said , however , that older german workers should not be overlooked in favor of immigrant laborers , adding that immigrants should not be considered " until we have done all we can to help our own people to become qualified and give them a chance . " for his part , seehofer , in an interview with focus magazine , said germany should not use a lack of skilled workers as an excuse to open its doors to all comers , adding that demands made of those who wish to move to germany should not be watered down . " we do not want to become the world 's welfare office , " he said . more people leave germany than enter german labor minister ursula von der leyen , however , said politicians need to consider lowering the barriers to entry for some foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
