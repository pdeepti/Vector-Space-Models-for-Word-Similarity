as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

scientists say the chemicals , once waterborne , can quickly spread throughout the globe . they 're in pesticides and solvents - and even in our medications .
an insidious threat to humans and animals , so-called xenobiotics are mostly synthetic chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and even act as poisons . when the chemicals become waterborne they can wreak havoc , especially on the human reproductive system , according to swedish hydrologist malin falkenmark . " these substances are a serious problem for us and for future generations , because they impact human fertility , " falkenmark said .
" in order to tackle this threat , we have to have to track down the source of the pollution .
once a substance is released into water it spreads throughout the world , because there is water everywhere . " estrogen in the water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xenobiotics can help microorganisms reactivate human waste perhaps the best-known example of xenobiotics comes from oral contraceptives .
when women take birth-control pills , their bodies pass the synthetic estrogen and progesterone out as waste into the water supply . university of basel biologist patricia holm said she blames such waterborne xenobiotics for many couples ' inability to conceive a child . " since these substances work just like hormones , all it takes is a single molecule to cause a reaction in one of the body 's receptors , " she told deutsche welle . " we can see that sperm counts in many countries have greatly dropped over the past 50 years , sometimes by as much as a half , " holm said .
" among women , we know that breast cancer rates are rising . " xenobiotics affect animals , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists blame water pollution for infertility - and cancer like many human-made problems , xenobiotics do n't just affect humans .
scientists have found the substances present in fish , white-tailed sea eagles and even polar bears . animal experiments , holm said , have shown that high levels of estrogen heighten the risk of tumors in rats , just as they raise women 's incidence of breast cancer . yet researchers ' knowledge of xenobiotics and their effects is far from complete .
scientists have only recently discovered that microbes in wastewater treatment plants , which were thought to help break down human waste , can actually reassemble many of the body 's waste products .
the mixture of synthetic substances in rivers and oceans appears to strengthen this effect . holm would like to see the topic of xenobiotics become a matter of public discussion , reaching beyond biologist and chemist circles .
she said she wants to see politicians and lawyers , as well as consumers , start asking whether particular medications are necessary , useful , or merely convenient . down the toilet while scientists may be capable of tracking down the source of most harmful pollutants , experts agree that it is better to never release them in the first place .
once a substance reaches water , it will sooner or later make its way back to us , they say - either in our drinking water or through the food chain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that waterborne pollutants can quickly spread across the globe an estimated third of the medications purchased in germany are improperly disposed in toilets , directly entering the water supply .
yet it would not be difficult to increase consumers ' awareness of the matter , according to claudia castell-exner of germany 's dvgw water conservationists ' lobby organization . " in the 1970s , people were better informed and more aware about medications , " said castell-exner .
" back then it was clear that you should n't flush unused drugs down the toilet . " until last year , germany had a system where pharmacies took back leftover medications .
according to castell-exner , pharmacies stopped that program , claiming they did n't want to take back drugs that were purchased over the internet . " that 's too bad because patients and consumers are much more open to environmentally friendly practices than we give them credit for , " castell-exner said . author : agnes buehring -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .

should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

general manager thomas ernst is happy about the new transfer . the north korean striker is a very robust player , who always goes directly for the goal , he says .

ivory coast international didier drogba was also one of his role models - at least until the world cup began .
" actually i tried to play like drogba .
but then i saw rooney play during the world cup .
now i rather want to be compared with him , " says chong tese . quite a stir in bochum , he is both successful on the pitch and popular off the pitch .

when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 14.10.2010 the weapons and tactics of a currency war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing keeps the yuan weak to promote exports although the us and china have recently traded harsh words over exchange rates , experts say currency manipulation and protectionism is nothing new .
if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 14.10.2010 french senate postpones pension reform vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have filled the streets since tuesday the french senate has delayed a vote to reform the pension system , with parliament now expected to debate the issue until next week .
as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .

scientists say the chemicals , once waterborne , can quickly spread throughout the globe . they 're in pesticides and solvents - and even in our medications .
an insidious threat to humans and animals , so-called xenobiotics are mostly synthetic chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and even act as poisons . when the chemicals become waterborne they can wreak havoc , especially on the human reproductive system , according to swedish hydrologist malin falkenmark . " these substances are a serious problem for us and for future generations , because they impact human fertility , " falkenmark said .
" in order to tackle this threat , we have to have to track down the source of the pollution .
once a substance is released into water it spreads throughout the world , because there is water everywhere . " estrogen in the water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xenobiotics can help microorganisms reactivate human waste perhaps the best-known example of xenobiotics comes from oral contraceptives .
when women take birth-control pills , their bodies pass the synthetic estrogen and progesterone out as waste into the water supply . university of basel biologist patricia holm said she blames such waterborne xenobiotics for many couples ' inability to conceive a child . " since these substances work just like hormones , all it takes is a single molecule to cause a reaction in one of the body 's receptors , " she told deutsche welle . " we can see that sperm counts in many countries have greatly dropped over the past 50 years , sometimes by as much as a half , " holm said .
" among women , we know that breast cancer rates are rising . " xenobiotics affect animals , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists blame water pollution for infertility - and cancer like many human-made problems , xenobiotics do n't just affect humans .
scientists have found the substances present in fish , white-tailed sea eagles and even polar bears . animal experiments , holm said , have shown that high levels of estrogen heighten the risk of tumors in rats , just as they raise women 's incidence of breast cancer . yet researchers ' knowledge of xenobiotics and their effects is far from complete .
scientists have only recently discovered that microbes in wastewater treatment plants , which were thought to help break down human waste , can actually reassemble many of the body 's waste products .
the mixture of synthetic substances in rivers and oceans appears to strengthen this effect . holm would like to see the topic of xenobiotics become a matter of public discussion , reaching beyond biologist and chemist circles .
she said she wants to see politicians and lawyers , as well as consumers , start asking whether particular medications are necessary , useful , or merely convenient . down the toilet while scientists may be capable of tracking down the source of most harmful pollutants , experts agree that it is better to never release them in the first place .
once a substance reaches water , it will sooner or later make its way back to us , they say - either in our drinking water or through the food chain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that waterborne pollutants can quickly spread across the globe an estimated third of the medications purchased in germany are improperly disposed in toilets , directly entering the water supply .
yet it would not be difficult to increase consumers ' awareness of the matter , according to claudia castell-exner of germany 's dvgw water conservationists ' lobby organization . " in the 1970s , people were better informed and more aware about medications , " said castell-exner .
" back then it was clear that you should n't flush unused drugs down the toilet . " until last year , germany had a system where pharmacies took back leftover medications .
according to castell-exner , pharmacies stopped that program , claiming they did n't want to take back drugs that were purchased over the internet .

an insidious threat to humans and animals , so-called xenobiotics are mostly synthetic chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and even act as poisons . when the chemicals become waterborne they can wreak havoc , especially on the human reproductive system , according to swedish hydrologist malin falkenmark . " these substances are a serious problem for us and for future generations , because they impact human fertility , " falkenmark said .
" in order to tackle this threat , we have to have to track down the source of the pollution .
once a substance is released into water it spreads throughout the world , because there is water everywhere . " estrogen in the water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xenobiotics can help microorganisms reactivate human waste perhaps the best-known example of xenobiotics comes from oral contraceptives .
when women take birth-control pills , their bodies pass the synthetic estrogen and progesterone out as waste into the water supply . university of basel biologist patricia holm said she blames such waterborne xenobiotics for many couples ' inability to conceive a child . " since these substances work just like hormones , all it takes is a single molecule to cause a reaction in one of the body 's receptors , " she told deutsche welle . " we can see that sperm counts in many countries have greatly dropped over the past 50 years , sometimes by as much as a half , " holm said .
" among women , we know that breast cancer rates are rising . " xenobiotics affect animals , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists blame water pollution for infertility - and cancer like many human-made problems , xenobiotics do n't just affect humans .
scientists have found the substances present in fish , white-tailed sea eagles and even polar bears . animal experiments , holm said , have shown that high levels of estrogen heighten the risk of tumors in rats , just as they raise women 's incidence of breast cancer . yet researchers ' knowledge of xenobiotics and their effects is far from complete .
scientists have only recently discovered that microbes in wastewater treatment plants , which were thought to help break down human waste , can actually reassemble many of the body 's waste products .
the mixture of synthetic substances in rivers and oceans appears to strengthen this effect . holm would like to see the topic of xenobiotics become a matter of public discussion , reaching beyond biologist and chemist circles .
she said she wants to see politicians and lawyers , as well as consumers , start asking whether particular medications are necessary , useful , or merely convenient . down the toilet while scientists may be capable of tracking down the source of most harmful pollutants , experts agree that it is better to never release them in the first place .
once a substance reaches water , it will sooner or later make its way back to us , they say - either in our drinking water or through the food chain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that waterborne pollutants can quickly spread across the globe an estimated third of the medications purchased in germany are improperly disposed in toilets , directly entering the water supply .
yet it would not be difficult to increase consumers ' awareness of the matter , according to claudia castell-exner of germany 's dvgw water conservationists ' lobby organization . " in the 1970s , people were better informed and more aware about medications , " said castell-exner .
" back then it was clear that you should n't flush unused drugs down the toilet . " until last year , germany had a system where pharmacies took back leftover medications .
according to castell-exner , pharmacies stopped that program , claiming they did n't want to take back drugs that were purchased over the internet . " that 's too bad because patients and consumers are much more open to environmentally friendly practices than we give them credit for , " castell-exner said . author : agnes buehring -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 14.10.2010 german autonomous car takes its first spin in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mig station wagon is a converted vw passat as google engineers and italian scientists take on autonomous cars , so too does a group in berlin .
they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 14.10.2010 french senate postpones pension reform vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have filled the streets since tuesday the french senate has delayed a vote to reform the pension system , with parliament now expected to debate the issue until next week .
as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 14.10.2010 german autonomous car takes its first spin in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mig station wagon is a converted vw passat as google engineers and italian scientists take on autonomous cars , so too does a group in berlin .
they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .

compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .

" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack .

scientists say the chemicals , once waterborne , can quickly spread throughout the globe . they 're in pesticides and solvents - and even in our medications .
an insidious threat to humans and animals , so-called xenobiotics are mostly synthetic chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and even act as poisons . when the chemicals become waterborne they can wreak havoc , especially on the human reproductive system , according to swedish hydrologist malin falkenmark . " these substances are a serious problem for us and for future generations , because they impact human fertility , " falkenmark said .
" in order to tackle this threat , we have to have to track down the source of the pollution .
once a substance is released into water it spreads throughout the world , because there is water everywhere . " estrogen in the water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xenobiotics can help microorganisms reactivate human waste perhaps the best-known example of xenobiotics comes from oral contraceptives .
when women take birth-control pills , their bodies pass the synthetic estrogen and progesterone out as waste into the water supply . university of basel biologist patricia holm said she blames such waterborne xenobiotics for many couples ' inability to conceive a child . " since these substances work just like hormones , all it takes is a single molecule to cause a reaction in one of the body 's receptors , " she told deutsche welle . " we can see that sperm counts in many countries have greatly dropped over the past 50 years , sometimes by as much as a half , " holm said .
" among women , we know that breast cancer rates are rising . " xenobiotics affect animals , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists blame water pollution for infertility - and cancer like many human-made problems , xenobiotics do n't just affect humans .
scientists have found the substances present in fish , white-tailed sea eagles and even polar bears . animal experiments , holm said , have shown that high levels of estrogen heighten the risk of tumors in rats , just as they raise women 's incidence of breast cancer . yet researchers ' knowledge of xenobiotics and their effects is far from complete .
scientists have only recently discovered that microbes in wastewater treatment plants , which were thought to help break down human waste , can actually reassemble many of the body 's waste products .
the mixture of synthetic substances in rivers and oceans appears to strengthen this effect . holm would like to see the topic of xenobiotics become a matter of public discussion , reaching beyond biologist and chemist circles .
she said she wants to see politicians and lawyers , as well as consumers , start asking whether particular medications are necessary , useful , or merely convenient . down the toilet while scientists may be capable of tracking down the source of most harmful pollutants , experts agree that it is better to never release them in the first place .

the summit was organized by the dw-akademie as a dialogue conference for young media professionals . for three days bloggers from germany and nine arab countries discussed questions including “ where are the borders between an ‘ orient ’ and an ‘ occident ’ in the global internet ? ”
and “ how can blogging help overcome these borders ? ”
at the end it was clear .
bloggers and readers ’ personal motives and attitudes were more important than cultural differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every blog comment on the internet , every message posted on twitter or facebook can contribute to more understanding between cultures .
but there ’ s no guarantee for this .
amira taher , an egyptian artist and blogger , said that without facial expressions or gestures , quick status messages couldn ’ t deepen personal experiences between people .
german and arab bloggers agreed that social media can have a democratizing effect by providing a counterweight to official positions .
but so far , concluded one group of participants , this isn ’ t the case in many arab countries .
in fact , it ’ s just the opposite : governments sometime use social networks to exercise more control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this raised the question of whether bloggers could or should remain anonymous .
that depended on a post ’ s objective , said german journalist , julia seeliger , because bloggers sometimes need to protect themselves .
but eman hashim , an egyptian feminist , herself found it a problem to encourage her readers to become involved without revealing her own identity .
when it comes to handling critical and opposing opinions most bloggers tended towards tolerance , in the sense of freedom of expression .
only slanders and lies , they said , should not be published .
the young media summit was aimed at a two-pronged dialogue – between the twelve arab and six german bloggers , and also between the arab participants themselves .
dozens of blog posts and hundreds of tweets reflected the great need to talk with each other .
the participants continued their dialogue at the german embassy ’ s reception celebrating the 20th anniversary of german reunification .
dw-akademie helped the deutschland-zentrum kairo , attached to the embassy , plan and organize the young media summit .
it was sponsored by the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bloggers presented the summit ’ s results during a two-hour panel discussion at cairo university .
a video of the discussion can be seen on the young media summit 2010 blog .
approximately 120 students attended and actively participated in the discussion , even debating issues such as taboos and -lrb- self- -rrb- censorship .
here it again became clear that most bloggers are autonomous and so diverse in their opinions that a question never gets just one response .
there was an exception , however .

the summit was organized by the dw-akademie as a dialogue conference for young media professionals . for three days bloggers from germany and nine arab countries discussed questions including “ where are the borders between an ‘ orient ’ and an ‘ occident ’ in the global internet ? ”
and “ how can blogging help overcome these borders ? ”
at the end it was clear .
bloggers and readers ’ personal motives and attitudes were more important than cultural differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every blog comment on the internet , every message posted on twitter or facebook can contribute to more understanding between cultures .
but there ’ s no guarantee for this .
amira taher , an egyptian artist and blogger , said that without facial expressions or gestures , quick status messages couldn ’ t deepen personal experiences between people .
german and arab bloggers agreed that social media can have a democratizing effect by providing a counterweight to official positions .
but so far , concluded one group of participants , this isn ’ t the case in many arab countries .
in fact , it ’ s just the opposite : governments sometime use social networks to exercise more control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this raised the question of whether bloggers could or should remain anonymous .
that depended on a post ’ s objective , said german journalist , julia seeliger , because bloggers sometimes need to protect themselves .
but eman hashim , an egyptian feminist , herself found it a problem to encourage her readers to become involved without revealing her own identity .
when it comes to handling critical and opposing opinions most bloggers tended towards tolerance , in the sense of freedom of expression .
only slanders and lies , they said , should not be published .
the young media summit was aimed at a two-pronged dialogue – between the twelve arab and six german bloggers , and also between the arab participants themselves .
dozens of blog posts and hundreds of tweets reflected the great need to talk with each other .
the participants continued their dialogue at the german embassy ’ s reception celebrating the 20th anniversary of german reunification .
dw-akademie helped the deutschland-zentrum kairo , attached to the embassy , plan and organize the young media summit .
it was sponsored by the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bloggers presented the summit ’ s results during a two-hour panel discussion at cairo university .
a video of the discussion can be seen on the young media summit 2010 blog .
approximately 120 students attended and actively participated in the discussion , even debating issues such as taboos and -lrb- self- -rrb- censorship .
here it again became clear that most bloggers are autonomous and so diverse in their opinions that a question never gets just one response .
there was an exception , however .
everyone agreed the dialogue should continue – preferably with another young media summit .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.10.2010 german universities enroll to school imams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders germany 's mosques may no longer be led mainly by turkish-trained imams .
that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .

the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 14.10.2010 the weapons and tactics of a currency war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing keeps the yuan weak to promote exports although the us and china have recently traded harsh words over exchange rates , experts say currency manipulation and protectionism is nothing new .
if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "

human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .

human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

the summit was organized by the dw-akademie as a dialogue conference for young media professionals . for three days bloggers from germany and nine arab countries discussed questions including “ where are the borders between an ‘ orient ’ and an ‘ occident ’ in the global internet ? ”
and “ how can blogging help overcome these borders ? ”
at the end it was clear .
bloggers and readers ’ personal motives and attitudes were more important than cultural differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every blog comment on the internet , every message posted on twitter or facebook can contribute to more understanding between cultures .
but there ’ s no guarantee for this .
amira taher , an egyptian artist and blogger , said that without facial expressions or gestures , quick status messages couldn ’ t deepen personal experiences between people .
german and arab bloggers agreed that social media can have a democratizing effect by providing a counterweight to official positions .
but so far , concluded one group of participants , this isn ’ t the case in many arab countries .
in fact , it ’ s just the opposite : governments sometime use social networks to exercise more control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this raised the question of whether bloggers could or should remain anonymous .
that depended on a post ’ s objective , said german journalist , julia seeliger , because bloggers sometimes need to protect themselves .
but eman hashim , an egyptian feminist , herself found it a problem to encourage her readers to become involved without revealing her own identity .
when it comes to handling critical and opposing opinions most bloggers tended towards tolerance , in the sense of freedom of expression .
only slanders and lies , they said , should not be published .
the young media summit was aimed at a two-pronged dialogue – between the twelve arab and six german bloggers , and also between the arab participants themselves .
dozens of blog posts and hundreds of tweets reflected the great need to talk with each other .
the participants continued their dialogue at the german embassy ’ s reception celebrating the 20th anniversary of german reunification .
dw-akademie helped the deutschland-zentrum kairo , attached to the embassy , plan and organize the young media summit .
it was sponsored by the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bloggers presented the summit ’ s results during a two-hour panel discussion at cairo university .
a video of the discussion can be seen on the young media summit 2010 blog .
approximately 120 students attended and actively participated in the discussion , even debating issues such as taboos and -lrb- self- -rrb- censorship .
here it again became clear that most bloggers are autonomous and so diverse in their opinions that a question never gets just one response .
there was an exception , however .
everyone agreed the dialogue should continue – preferably with another young media summit .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

scientists say the chemicals , once waterborne , can quickly spread throughout the globe . they 're in pesticides and solvents - and even in our medications .
an insidious threat to humans and animals , so-called xenobiotics are mostly synthetic chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and even act as poisons . when the chemicals become waterborne they can wreak havoc , especially on the human reproductive system , according to swedish hydrologist malin falkenmark . " these substances are a serious problem for us and for future generations , because they impact human fertility , " falkenmark said .

scientists have only recently discovered that microbes in wastewater treatment plants , which were thought to help break down human waste , can actually reassemble many of the body 's waste products .
the mixture of synthetic substances in rivers and oceans appears to strengthen this effect . holm would like to see the topic of xenobiotics become a matter of public discussion , reaching beyond biologist and chemist circles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 14.10.2010 germany backs nato plan for missile-defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 28 nato defense and foreign ministers gathered in brussels for the first time in over a decade , all the foreign and defense ministers of nato member states convened in brussels thursday to discuss plans to reshape the military alliance - including major budget cuts . germany has expressed its approval for an anti-missile system proposed by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at a summit of member countries ' defense and foreign ministers . the 28-nation military alliance gathered thursday in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy designed to usher in a new era with a new orientation .
top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 14.10.2010 german autonomous car takes its first spin in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mig station wagon is a converted vw passat as google engineers and italian scientists take on autonomous cars , so too does a group in berlin .
they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 14.10.2010 klose deserving of legend status as goal record beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose 's service to germany should be recognized as miroslav klose nears gerd mueller 's international goals record , perhaps it 's time the bayern munich striker finally gets the credit he deserves and is honored as a german legend . when klose scored his 58th international goal against kazakhstan this week , the bayern munich striker moved to within 10 goals of germany ’ s all-time record held by gerd mueller .
when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .

" klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .
" what we ’ re dealing with at the moment is cyber espionage and sabotage rather than warfare , which suggests all-out conflict . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .
" what we ’ re dealing with at the moment is cyber espionage and sabotage rather than warfare , which suggests all-out conflict . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .
" what we ’ re dealing with at the moment is cyber espionage and sabotage rather than warfare , which suggests all-out conflict . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .

should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies .

" it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .

identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 14.10.2010 klose deserving of legend status as goal record beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose 's service to germany should be recognized as miroslav klose nears gerd mueller 's international goals record , perhaps it 's time the bayern munich striker finally gets the credit he deserves and is honored as a german legend . when klose scored his 58th international goal against kazakhstan this week , the bayern munich striker moved to within 10 goals of germany ’ s all-time record held by gerd mueller .
when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "

when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.10.2010 religious minorities face persecution in myanmar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of the mainly christian kachin minority outside a church in the town of laiza human rights groups say that the ruling junta in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- is increasingly persecuting religious minorities , particularly christians and muslims . there are about a hundred ethnic minority groups in myanmar .
many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .

" the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .

the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 14.10.2010 the weapons and tactics of a currency war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing keeps the yuan weak to promote exports although the us and china have recently traded harsh words over exchange rates , experts say currency manipulation and protectionism is nothing new .
if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

scientists say the chemicals , once waterborne , can quickly spread throughout the globe . they 're in pesticides and solvents - and even in our medications .
an insidious threat to humans and animals , so-called xenobiotics are mostly synthetic chemicals that can interfere with the endocrine system and even act as poisons . when the chemicals become waterborne they can wreak havoc , especially on the human reproductive system , according to swedish hydrologist malin falkenmark . " these substances are a serious problem for us and for future generations , because they impact human fertility , " falkenmark said .
" in order to tackle this threat , we have to have to track down the source of the pollution .
once a substance is released into water it spreads throughout the world , because there is water everywhere . " estrogen in the water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xenobiotics can help microorganisms reactivate human waste perhaps the best-known example of xenobiotics comes from oral contraceptives .
when women take birth-control pills , their bodies pass the synthetic estrogen and progesterone out as waste into the water supply . university of basel biologist patricia holm said she blames such waterborne xenobiotics for many couples ' inability to conceive a child . " since these substances work just like hormones , all it takes is a single molecule to cause a reaction in one of the body 's receptors , " she told deutsche welle . " we can see that sperm counts in many countries have greatly dropped over the past 50 years , sometimes by as much as a half , " holm said .
" among women , we know that breast cancer rates are rising . " xenobiotics affect animals , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists blame water pollution for infertility - and cancer like many human-made problems , xenobiotics do n't just affect humans .
scientists have found the substances present in fish , white-tailed sea eagles and even polar bears . animal experiments , holm said , have shown that high levels of estrogen heighten the risk of tumors in rats , just as they raise women 's incidence of breast cancer . yet researchers ' knowledge of xenobiotics and their effects is far from complete .
scientists have only recently discovered that microbes in wastewater treatment plants , which were thought to help break down human waste , can actually reassemble many of the body 's waste products .
the mixture of synthetic substances in rivers and oceans appears to strengthen this effect . holm would like to see the topic of xenobiotics become a matter of public discussion , reaching beyond biologist and chemist circles .
she said she wants to see politicians and lawyers , as well as consumers , start asking whether particular medications are necessary , useful , or merely convenient . down the toilet while scientists may be capable of tracking down the source of most harmful pollutants , experts agree that it is better to never release them in the first place .
once a substance reaches water , it will sooner or later make its way back to us , they say - either in our drinking water or through the food chain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that waterborne pollutants can quickly spread across the globe an estimated third of the medications purchased in germany are improperly disposed in toilets , directly entering the water supply .
yet it would not be difficult to increase consumers ' awareness of the matter , according to claudia castell-exner of germany 's dvgw water conservationists ' lobby organization . " in the 1970s , people were better informed and more aware about medications , " said castell-exner .
" back then it was clear that you should n't flush unused drugs down the toilet . " until last year , germany had a system where pharmacies took back leftover medications .
according to castell-exner , pharmacies stopped that program , claiming they did n't want to take back drugs that were purchased over the internet . " that 's too bad because patients and consumers are much more open to environmentally friendly practices than we give them credit for , " castell-exner said . author : agnes buehring -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 14.10.2010 klose deserving of legend status as goal record beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose 's service to germany should be recognized as miroslav klose nears gerd mueller 's international goals record , perhaps it 's time the bayern munich striker finally gets the credit he deserves and is honored as a german legend . when klose scored his 58th international goal against kazakhstan this week , the bayern munich striker moved to within 10 goals of germany ’ s all-time record held by gerd mueller .
when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

the summit was organized by the dw-akademie as a dialogue conference for young media professionals . for three days bloggers from germany and nine arab countries discussed questions including “ where are the borders between an ‘ orient ’ and an ‘ occident ’ in the global internet ? ”
and “ how can blogging help overcome these borders ? ”
at the end it was clear .
bloggers and readers ’ personal motives and attitudes were more important than cultural differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every blog comment on the internet , every message posted on twitter or facebook can contribute to more understanding between cultures .
but there ’ s no guarantee for this .
amira taher , an egyptian artist and blogger , said that without facial expressions or gestures , quick status messages couldn ’ t deepen personal experiences between people .
german and arab bloggers agreed that social media can have a democratizing effect by providing a counterweight to official positions .
but so far , concluded one group of participants , this isn ’ t the case in many arab countries .
in fact , it ’ s just the opposite : governments sometime use social networks to exercise more control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this raised the question of whether bloggers could or should remain anonymous .
that depended on a post ’ s objective , said german journalist , julia seeliger , because bloggers sometimes need to protect themselves .
but eman hashim , an egyptian feminist , herself found it a problem to encourage her readers to become involved without revealing her own identity .
when it comes to handling critical and opposing opinions most bloggers tended towards tolerance , in the sense of freedom of expression .
only slanders and lies , they said , should not be published .
the young media summit was aimed at a two-pronged dialogue – between the twelve arab and six german bloggers , and also between the arab participants themselves .
dozens of blog posts and hundreds of tweets reflected the great need to talk with each other .
the participants continued their dialogue at the german embassy ’ s reception celebrating the 20th anniversary of german reunification .
dw-akademie helped the deutschland-zentrum kairo , attached to the embassy , plan and organize the young media summit .
it was sponsored by the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bloggers presented the summit ’ s results during a two-hour panel discussion at cairo university .
a video of the discussion can be seen on the young media summit 2010 blog .
approximately 120 students attended and actively participated in the discussion , even debating issues such as taboos and -lrb- self- -rrb- censorship .
here it again became clear that most bloggers are autonomous and so diverse in their opinions that a question never gets just one response .
there was an exception , however .
everyone agreed the dialogue should continue – preferably with another young media summit .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .

" we have reached a common conclusion with the trade unions on paying bonuses to civil servants on the basis of an analysis conducted by a joint commission , " finance minister gheorghe ialomitianu said .
the protest started on wednesday when about 200 employees in the finance ministry 's headquarters refused to go to work and lined up in front of minister gheorghe ialomitianu 's office .
ialomitianu was barricaded in his office until police arrived to escort from the building .
the strike spread on thursday as tax offices and employment agencies in most cities were closed as thousands of civil servants demonstrated in the streets to demand a living wage .

the cuts were part of government 's austerity measures necessary to maintain the terms of an international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- bailout .
despite suffering from a recession , romania has taken drastic measures in order to keep the terms of 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- imf bailout on which it is dependent .
over the summer , the government cut all civil servants ' salaries by a quarter and raised the rate of value-added tax from 19 to 24 percent .

when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 14.10.2010 german autonomous car takes its first spin in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mig station wagon is a converted vw passat as google engineers and italian scientists take on autonomous cars , so too does a group in berlin .
they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .
smart functions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr daniel göhring sits in the driver 's seat with his hands behind his head to show that he really is n't driving .
compared to 20 years ago or even 10 years ago , new cars today have a range of " smart " safety functions , from lane departure warning , and adaptive cruise-control , to assisted braking .
volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .

" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 14.10.2010 german universities enroll to school imams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders germany 's mosques may no longer be led mainly by turkish-trained imams .
that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .
the majority of imams in germany are hired and paid by the turkish state , and are regarded by many as having too little knowledge of german society .
establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "
critics unsure if muslims will respond yet it remains to be seen if german-trained imams and teachers really will fulfill such expectations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elite university of muenster will soon host a faculty of muslim theology although education minister schavan believes german universities ' experience in training christian theologians will boost their ability to train muslim leaders , some critics fear that muslim communities may not want imams trained in the secular atmosphere of a german university .
critics also fear that efforts to enroll women in the courses could undermine the credibility of the new institutions among muslims in germany and beyond .

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

many of them have long been demanding self-determination and have launched armed struggles against the army .
for example , many karen , who live in southeastern myanmar , have joined the militant karen national union , which is led by christians , says martin petrich from human rights watchdog amnesty international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a karen woman " many karen live near the border with thailand , where they face brutal repression .
because there is an ongoing war against the group , their villages are often raided ; the men are abducted and used as porters , women are raped , children killed . "
about 150,000 karen have fled to thailand .
human rights groups estimate that half of them are christians .
religious symbols targeted the plight of the chin in western myanmar is similar .
many of them have become fighters of the " chin national front " .
100,000 chin are said to have fled to neighboring india .
the junta does not persecute christians because of their religion but rather because they support the different ethnic insurgencies .
however , the military does target religious symbols to demonstrate its power , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" they 'll say ' we ’ ll burn down your church ' , or ' we won ’ t allow you to build a church ' .
it is all about basically saying to the civilians that they live under army control , so the army can do whatever they want with them .
so religious persecution is just one method by which the army controls and terrorizes the local population . "
muslim minority not recognized as citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of rohingya refugees have fled to bangladesh out of myanmar 's overall population of 55 million , about six percent are christians and four percent muslims .
the muslim rohingya minority in southwestern myanmar is perhaps suffering the most among all ethnic groups in the country .
human rights groups have documented severe rights violations including dispossession , torture , forced labor and rape .
the regime does not even recognize the rohingya as citizens of myanmar .
" muslims mostly face the problem that they are made scapegoats for domestic problems whenever there is a crisis , for example after 9/11 , " says bernd zoellner , an expert on myanmar at hamburg university .
pressure to convert to buddhism to some extent , religious and ethnic conflict lines are blurred in myanmar .
the military rulers belong to the majority burman ethnic group , also known as bamar .
and they also use buddhism , the majority religion , to prop up their rule , says david mathieson from human rights watch .
" there are a lot of stories of people who - either in the military or in the public service or even in business - find that their career is coming to a hold at a certain level if the do not convert to buddhism . "
myanmar 's new constitution of 2008 forbids discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds .
but it also mentions that misusing religion for political ends is forbidden .
rights groups argue that this paragraph paves the way for persecuting religious minorities , as any public activity can easily be declared political .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 14.10.2010 the weapons and tactics of a currency war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing keeps the yuan weak to promote exports although the us and china have recently traded harsh words over exchange rates , experts say currency manipulation and protectionism is nothing new .
if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .

those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .

in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "

but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance nato -pipe- 14.10.2010 germany backs nato plan for missile-defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 28 nato defense and foreign ministers gathered in brussels for the first time in over a decade , all the foreign and defense ministers of nato member states convened in brussels thursday to discuss plans to reshape the military alliance - including major budget cuts . germany has expressed its approval for an anti-missile system proposed by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at a summit of member countries ' defense and foreign ministers . the 28-nation military alliance gathered thursday in brussels to discuss its new 10-year strategy designed to usher in a new era with a new orientation .
top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the new strategy will maintain nato 's unity westerwelle was also pleased to see that rasmussen 's plan for nato 's future stressed nuclear disarmament , which he called a " great breakthrough " - although the plan did not concretely respond to the minister 's recent proposal to do away with the 10 to 20 nuclear warheads remaining in germany . meanwhile at the summit , guttenberg urged a skeptical france to get on the bandwagon for disarmament , saying , " these components of disarmament , this momentum ... is of benefit . " germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .
it is intended to be passed at a nato summit to be held in the portuguese capital , lisbon , in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato still hopes for a nuclear-free world aside from modernizing weapons defense , the plan is also expected to urge nato nations to increase cooperation with non-nato member states , such as japan , india , china and australia .
the alliance 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said ahead of the summit that the new plan was primarily aimed at making sure nato remained " the most successful alliance in history . "
nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

they hope to kickstart the industry with new kinds of cars within a decade or sooner . yesterday , scientists from berlin 's free university demonstrated their autonomous car dubbed " made in germany " or mig .
the converted volkswagen passat station wagon is equipped with discreet sensors , cameras and a computer system , which is able to process the input , and steer , accelerate and brake appropriately .
raul rojas , professor of artifical intelligence at the free university and head of the berlin research team , said that intelligent cars will reduce the number of accidents and be more environmentally friendly due to increased efficiency and car sharing .
during the demonstration at berlin 's former tempelhof airport the car was given instructrions via an ipad using gps coordinates and displayed on google maps .
this demonstration comes at a time when there is an increased focus on autonomous cars .
earlier this month , google announced its own such project underway in california , while another italian team is currently conducting an extensive road test from italy to china .
all of these projects are the result of a series of us government-sponsored autonomous car challenges over the last six years .
the berlin research team created an obstacle course simulating real-world conditions which included car-lanes , traffic lights , cyclists , a couple with a stroller , and a ball being suddenly thrown into the path of the mig car .
in another instance mig navigated around a car that had stopped in front of it and then avoided a traffic road-block .
autonomous cars are about mobility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ipad software can show a whole range of parameters , including the car 's speed .
rojas said that he sees autonomous cars being used in a car-sharing situation , thereby increasing the efficiency of this mode of transport .
alberto broggi , a professor of computer engineering at the university of parma in italy , has also been working on the development of autonomous cars for many years .
he currently heads the vislab intercontinental autonomous challenge to drive a car from parma , italy , to shanghai , china .
for broggi as well , autonomous cars are about accessibility .
" young people or elderly people , or people who with no driving license , " he said . " if you have a vehicle that can drive by itself , they can benefit from an extended level of mobility . "
both broggi and rojas agree that autonomous cars could be introduced on highways much sooner than in urban areas .
" highway driving is a kind of friendly environment , a structured environment , everybody 's moving in the same direction .
there 's no traffic lights , " he said .
broggi added that autonomous vehicles could be very useful in particular industries like mining and agriculture where there are " pre-structured environments " , for example " a tractor could move on the field without anybody on board . "
challenges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the real-world scenarios was a couple with a stroller crossing the street .
when asked about the possibility of software malfunctions or computer crashes , rojas said the answer is having redundant or back-up systems .
that means having not just one computer on board , but two or even three .
" one computer is driving and the other two are just watching the first computer over the shoulder , " he said . " and if they detect any malfunction or if they see that the computer is not giving the appropriate instructions , they can take over or they can stop the car . "
but if something were to really go wrong , broggi said there are legal aspects still to resolve as well , like who is to blame if your vehicle has an accident .
but rojas said that compared to a human who can adapt to the changes in the environment , the real challenge is creating an intelligent system that is also capable of learning .
rojas added that car manufacturers are afraid they will lose customers with this kind of technology , but thinks they will adapt by transforming " into mobility producers or mobility service companies . "
rojas believes that autonomous cars are the way of the future in terms of safety , the environment and of course mobility .
" right now we have so many cars in the streets because nobody wants to lose mobility .
the moment you offer the same mobility , then i think people will accept this technology , " he said .

volvo recently announced its pedestrian detection system .
for rojas , he thinks of all these kinds of driver-assistant systems in a more personal way .
" i always say its like having my wife in the car telling me what i am doing wrong when i am driving , " he said .
with google 's announcement last week about its autonomous car , the spotlight has landed on this field of research .
rojas said it 's a positive step .
" of course that 's a big advantage if you have a big company like google behind your results , that 's a game-changer - it 's not just any company , " he said .

that 's the goal of a government-funded initiative to bring muslim religious teaching to four german universities by next autumn . german universities will soon train muslim religious leaders , the country 's education minister annette schavan announced thursday in berlin .
berlin has earmarked some 16 million euros -lrb- $ 22.5 million -rrb- for four universities to establish new islamic theology faculties over an initial five-year period .
the goal is that german-trained imams will help integrate the country 's approximately 4 million muslims into mainstream german society .
" we wish to train as many imams in germany as possible , because we are convinced they are able to build bridges between their congregations and society , " schavan said , adding , " muslim priests will have an increasing role to play , so it 's important they know about life in the country where they preach . "
a first contingent of up to 500 new students could be enrolled in academic courses aimed at training imams and islamic religious teachers by september 2011 , schavan announced .
the new faculties will be established at universities in tuebingen , muenster / osnabrueck , erlangen and a fourth university which has yet to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of germany 's imams were educated in turkey the establishment of muslim theological faculties at german universities is also intended to halt the spread of islamist fundamentalism .

establishing a german muslim discourse the new institutions are intended to help muslim theologians advance the debate about islam in modern life , according to the university of bern 's reinhard schluze , a member of the academic panel that selected the universities .
" the university has the task to establish a critical discourse on religion from the point of view of the muslim community itself - a sort of critical perspective of their own tradition so that -lsb- the university -rsb- can contribute to discussions in the fields of ethics , norms in society , of democracy , pluralism , etc . , " he said .
schulze also admits that the potential emergence of an academic elite of german-trained muslim teachers and imams would be a welcome side effect , allowing germany to put its stamp on muslim discourse and hopefully curb the rise of islamist fundamentalism .
" up to now political islam is the main form of interpreting islam in germany , " schulze said , adding , " we want to supplement this political discourse with a theological discourse in order to prevent that political islam becomes the major point of reference for muslims in germany . "

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 14.10.2010 the weapons and tactics of a currency war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing keeps the yuan weak to promote exports although the us and china have recently traded harsh words over exchange rates , experts say currency manipulation and protectionism is nothing new .
if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

if escalated , though , the fight could have disastrous consequences . conflict is growing in the trade relationship between the united states and china , with the yuan being held at an artificially low value to secure a competitive advantage for chinese exports .
goods produced in a country such as china with an inexpensive currency effectively cost less when sold to consumers in a country with a higher value currency .
those goods then become desirable , helping to spur the economy in the producing country .
but china is by no means alone in engaging in this type of policy .
many countries seek to make their exports more attractive by keeping their currency weak .
and there are plenty of strategies by which to do so .
holger bahr , an economist at dekabank , says china is n't devaluing the yuan , but rather has been keeping it pegged to the dollar at a low rate of exchange .
instead of devaluing its currency , china simply never let it get strong .
“ the chinese have a fixed exchange rate with the americans , which wavers very little , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ there is a slight adjustment – a slight increase in value – which is determined each month . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are competitive because they 're inexpensive “ in the end it 's a decision of the government – of the finance ministry – as to what 's undertaken by the central bank , ” bahr said .
“ concretely put , this means that by buying or selling american government bonds , the chinese can keep the exchange rate between the chinese and american currencies precisely where they want it to be . ”
us producers ca n't compete china keeps the yuan approximately 20 to 30 percent below the level that an objective evaluation of its market position would dictate .
this makes chinese exports so inexpensive that the us complains its producers simply ca n't compete .
in turn , the us protects its own interests by weakening the dollar , but it does n't do so by manipulating exchange rates .
instead , it uses monetary policies which support banks , make credit inexpensive and bolster its economy .
this jockeying for a low-ball position has seen the us budget deficit grow , while its central bank continues to print money .
trade partners suffer stefan rieke , an economist with bhf bank , says the effects are felt by neighboring countries and trade partners .
“ the aggressive monetary policies of the us are above all targeted to stimulate employment in the us – to stimulate growth , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ of course this has side effects in neighboring countries and with trade partners via the exchange rate .
it causes their currencies to solidify , which can be a problem . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us supports banks and makes credit cheap to bolster its economy the chief problem is that the many dollars printed by the us are sure to be invested somewhere sooner or later .
many dollar-based investors have sent their money to brazil , where it needs to be converted into brazilian real .
the increasing demand for real caused the currency ’ s value to increase - something the brazilian government was eager to stop in an effort to protect its export sector .
it therefore saddled foreign investors with new taxes to slow the flow of foreign capital and relive the upward pressure on the real .
another classic strategy employed by central bankers is to sell off reserves of their own currency to lower the its value .
in the past , switzerland has done so with its franc , and japan with its yen .
both currencies had increased in value to the point where the governments became worried about their export competitiveness .
stability through quality exports but currency devaluation is n't the only way to ensure sales of exports .
the euro is a strong currency , but that has n't hindered germany 's exports , which nevertheless fare fairly well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a strong currency , but germany has been able to compete thomas meissner of the dz bank says this is because german exports are often of a very high quality , meaning foreign customers are willing to pay more for them .
" because of its export structure – specifically when it comes to machines and facilities – germany actually has a somewhat more comfortable situation , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the demand for these machines is relatively stable in terms of price and therefore does n't react so drastically when the euro gains in value .
at some point there 's a limit , of course .
but even at the high point of $ 1.60 for each euro in april of 2008 , the european central bank did n't intervene . ”
import tax would devastate a fairly high degree of economic performance is necessary to take a relaxed approach to currency exchange politics .
whenever that level of core performance is missing , governments compensate with other measures .
the us , for instance , has threatened to tax chinese imports unless the yuan is allowed to appreciate in value .
holger bahr of dekabank says such protectionist measures could have terrible consequences .
“ in fact that would be a further level of escalation – a very terrible one , i believe , ” he said .
“ there are always ideas which are protectionist in nature to put other countries in check with trade restrictions .
but when one starts to erode free trade , erode globalization , erode the solid footing … that 's a form of escalation which can damage global trade in the long term .
the global economy would n't really be able to support that . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 14.10.2010 klose deserving of legend status as goal record beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose 's service to germany should be recognized as miroslav klose nears gerd mueller 's international goals record , perhaps it 's time the bayern munich striker finally gets the credit he deserves and is honored as a german legend . when klose scored his 58th international goal against kazakhstan this week , the bayern munich striker moved to within 10 goals of germany ’ s all-time record held by gerd mueller .
when presented with this statistic by a reporter , the soft-spoken , deep-thinking klose chose only to comment on the importance of the win , not the fact that he had taken another step towards greatness .
perhaps this self-effacing reluctance to consider his own personal goals have combined to shroud klose in a kind of cloaking device , making it difficult for the world to see him as one of the game 's all-time great strikers .
in the modern game , unassuming players like klose are rare .
for klose , there is no nickname like " der bomber " which resounds through history or a sunny , enthusiastic disposition like that which put a spotlight on juergen klinsmann 's talents .
the man quietly and affectionately known as " miro " has taken a stoic route through his career , letting his feet and the growing list of statistics tell his story . " if klose was revered as a legend we would n't be asking these questions about him , " joerg jakob , deputy editor-in-chief at kicker magazine told deutsche welle . " obviously he ’ s one of the game 's top strikers and he ’ s a top international player , but he will never be a legend in the eyes of german fans . " " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

" " mainly it is because of his personality , " said jakob , explaining that klose is perhaps too quiet and not glamorous enough to become a legend .
" people see him as hard worker , a player unaffected by scandal , an honest footballer … but he 's not seen as a star . " goal-filled club career deserves more silverware bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose -lrb- r . -rrb- began his rise to the top at kaiserslautern klose has had a formidable run in the bundesliga since making his debut for kaiserslautern in 1999 .
in 293 league games played at kaiserslautern , werder bremen and bayern munich , klose has hit 120 bundesliga goals .
a nice goal-scoring haul , but klose should perhaps have won more silverware .
he can look back at two cup wins and a pair of bundesliga titles earned during his time in bavaria , but it could be argued that klose 's efforts at kaiserslautern and werder , where he was the centerpiece of the side , should have merited more .
" klose is a legend at kaiserslautern , where he started ; he 's seen as a hero like fritz walter there , " said jakob .
" his qualities are respected there and he is loved because of them .
the fans do love him .
he was also respected in the same way at bremen .
he was a typical werder player in many ways . " but the bayern munich-vintage klose has never elicited the same type of excitement from crowds as teammates like robben or ribery , even though an on-form klose can be more damaging to opposing teams than either of his bayern team mates .
he is , after all , the man charged with adding the end product to their trickery . but there ’ s the rub - klose 's currency is goals , and his return of late has been paltry for a player of his standing .
still , a barren spell - however long - shouldn ’ t be allowed to mar his reputation . " it 's very hard for klose at bayern because while they are the biggest team in germany with the biggest support and fans all over germany , they are also the most hated team , " jakob said .
" it makes it very hard for fans of other teams to love you when you play for bayern , even when you play well for germany .
if you ’ re a star , maybe you stand a chance , but klose does n't have that star power . " klose in danger of being remembered as an enigma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose 's struggles at bayern endanger his bundesliga legacy these days , due in part to his dwindling bundesliga return , klose is better known for being an enigma ; a striker who excels for the national team while underperforming at club level .
even he is at a loss to explain it : " why do i score for germany and not bayern munich ?
i ask myself every time , " he said after his two goals against turkey last week .
" here i have more luck , which is lacking when i play for bayern . " if it is luck which keeps him scoring for germany then it 's one of the longest runs of good fortune in history .
klose , who made his debut for germany in 2001 , has 58 international goals from 105 caps , surpassing franz beckenbauer 's mark of 103 and moving into fourth place on the list of most-capped german players .
germany has also never lost a game in which klose has scored , so his is the kind of luck that gets spread around . since making his international mark in coming second in the world cup scoring stakes with five strikes in 2002 , he topped the goal charts with five more in 2006 and continued his tournament form in this summer 's competition in south africa , scoring four . in total , klose has 14 goals in world cup finals , just two behind brazil 's ronaldo , putting him joint second along with gerd mueller on the list of fifa world cup goal scorers .
and yet the names on people 's lips when talking about world cup greats will always be pele , maradona , beckenbauer , cruyff … .
the list goes on , but klose 's rarely features . goal scoring record should secure klose among the greats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal king gerd mueller 's record is in klose 's sights on the strength of his international career alone , klose should at least be celebrated as a german legend .
he has some way to go to beat the record number of 150 caps set by lothar matthaeus but as a striker , klose should be judged by his trade and to eclipse gerd mueller 's long-standing goal record should automatically elevate him to legendary status .
eleven goals for klose in his current international form should not be a problem so the chances are high that the record will fall sooner rather than later . " klose has everything you would want from a player ; he 's committed , a good team player , a good character and a striker who scores a lot of goals , " said jakob . " but times are changing .
this is n't enough .
even if he beats mueller 's record , he wo n't be seen as a legend . " it 's unlikey that you 'll see much of a celebration from klose should he beat der bomber 's record .
germany , on the other hand , should hold him aloft and sing his name .

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

top of the agenda was a nuclear-missile shield to protect europe and north america . " we believe that , on substance , the missile shield is a good idea , " german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg told reporters ahead of the meeting .
under discussion is a proposal by rasmussen and united states defense secretary robert gates to raise 200 million euros -lrb- $ 278.8 million -rrb- over the coming decade to finance an integration of existing missile defense capabilities with missile interceptors the us plans to install in europe . germany pushes disarmament german foreign minister guido westerwelle told reporters that nato wanted to include russia in the missile-defense project , which he called a “ crucial breakthrough . “ " our impression is that the signs point to pragmatism and an easing of tension , " he added .

" germany 's ruling coalition committed last november to the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german territory , and , along with a handful of other eu countries , called for a debate about their future in europe .
attention also turned to the nuclear weapons stationed with us and allied air forces in germany after washington and moscow reached a deal to reduce the number of deployed long-range , " strategic " nuclear warheads .
the german government has also said it wants to see all nato missions require the approval of the united nations . nato to make cuts while there are still no concrete figures on how much a new missile shield will cost nato countries , defense ministers approved plans thursday to slash nato 's command and administrative structure in order to save funds . ministers approved rasmussen 's proposal to cut the military alliance 's staff from some 13,000 to under 9,000 and dismantle at least four of its 11 command bases . member countries will not begin debates until 2011 on who must give up their prestigious bases . secret new strategies efforts have been made to keep nato 's new strategy secret , although the basic tenets of the plan are well known .

nato 3.0 rasmussen said that following the cold war and the ensuing transition to a post-soviet world , the time had come to remodel the international union - to create nato 3.0 .
" an alliance which can defend the 900 million citizens of nato countries against the threats we face today and will face in the coming decade , " he said .
the new strategy foresees a multitude of new threats coming from all directions , including terrorist attacks on national resources and supply channels , and from so-called rogue states such as iran .
rasmussen also singled out cyber attacks as a cause for concern , but said any invocation of nato 's well-known article 5 - which , if activated , classifies an attack on one nato member an attack on all nato members - would be considered on a case-by-case basis .
" neither cyber attacks , nor any other kind of attacks , could be described as a clear article 5 case in advance , " rasmussen said .
" there is what i would call a constructive ambiguity , and that 's exactly the strength of article 5 , that potential aggressors never know when the alliance will invoke article 5 . "
the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states marked the first occasion on which article 5 was invoked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 14.10.2010 eu approves french online music subsidy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french plan would target the country 's youth a new plan would let french youth buy 50 euro online music subscriptions for only 25 euros .
but critics say the scheme wo n't solve the much larger problem of online piracy . the european union on tuesday approved a plan that would let the french government subsidize music purchases through online subscription services . the scheme would allow french citizens between the ages of 15 and 25 to purchase a 50 euro -lrb- $ 70 -rrb- carte musique , or " music card , " for only 25 euros .
the money could be spent on online music subscription services .
french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as protests against the plans continue , france faces the possibility of fuel shortages . france 's senate has delayed a planned vote on a bill that would introduce pension reforms and raise the retirement age , a ruling party spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the legislation , which would raise the early retirement age from 60 to 62 by 2018 and lift the age of eligibility for a full pension from 65 to 67 , has set off nationwide strikes and protests , disrupting transport , schools and services .
the vote , which had been expected to be held on friday or saturday , has been pushed back until october 20 , according to a lawmaker speaking to the agence france-presse news agency .
the spokeswoman for the ruling conservative ump party said parliament 's upper house needed more time to debate around 820 proposed amendments filed by the socialist opposition .
with people living longer and france 's public deficit at record levels , president nicolas sarkozy says the bill is needed to help ease the cash crunch in the pension system .
but unions and the opposition accuse sarkozy of making workers pay an unfair share of the bill for the financial crisis .
strikes continue labor unions have been leading an open-ended strike against the bill since tuesday , when between 1.2 and 3.5 million people took to the streets of paris and other cities , according to police and trade union estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has refused to back down the strikes eased somewhat on wednesday , as flights from paris ' main airports returned to normal and international rail service to london , belgium and the netherlands resumed .
but as strikes entered a third day , france 's national rail authority sncf said only about four in 10 scheduled high-speed tgv trains were operating and about one in two regional trains .
unions have called for more protests on saturday , and bernard thibault , leader of the cgt union , said they were " looking for new ways to pressure the government . "
sarkozy has refused to back down over his plan to raise the retirement age , saying he would " go no farther " in terms of concessions .
fuel shortages meanwhile , france could be facing fuel shortages as soon as thursday after the strikes shut down 70 percent of the its oil refining capacity .
eight of france 's 12 refineries were in the process of shutting down operations , while another three have seen their output severely disrupted by strike action .
a spokesman for french oil giant total confirmed the shutdowns , but jean-louis schilansky , the chairman of the oil industry association , said france 's fuel depots had enough in stock to keep the nation 's filling stations running for the moment .
however , he warned that " if the situation continues as it is now , we 'll have to take a serious look at the problem of strategic stocks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

french officials have said the plan would last for two years and people would be able to buy one subsidized card per year . it 's the latest development since french president nicolas sarkozy first proposed the plan at a speech in paris in january , where he argued that french youth do n't pay for music because they are so accustomed to getting everything online for free . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy spearheaded the music card plan " we have to absolutely re-create a market , " he said during the speech .
" let me add that buying music is a good investment , beyond simple pleasure .
i hope that the music card for youth will be put into place as soon as possible , by summer 2010 , for all music , of course . " the music card plan has not moved as fast as sarkozy had hoped , and it may take even longer , given that the government has not stated when it will launch , nor which music sales services it will work with .
the government has said the cards will only be used on subscription-based sites , like emusic , and not services that offer individual tracks for download , like itunes . industry says piracy hurts profits the music industry has said piracy is hurting their business , especially in european countries where piracy is rife , as is the case in spain and france . the international federation of the phonographic industry reported in january that france has seen local artist album releases fall by 60 percent between 2003 and 2009 .
the federation links this drop to its statistics showing that one-quarter of the french online population illegally downloads music . online music stores will also have to contribute a little something in return for the subsidized cards .
the new government measure will require music operators to reduce prices , extend subscriptions times and advertise for the music card on their websites .
plus , they can only receive a maximum subsidy of 5 million euros per year . eu market reform needed but online industry observers are not convinced that such a scheme will solve , or even make a dent , in the larger online piracy problem . " this is a small and inadequate recognition of something that 's far bigger and more difficult to fix , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a non-profit organization in brussels .
" the market in europe for digital content is extremely fragmented , extremely uncompetitive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all music sold in the eu via itunes and other services are available in all countries in other words , the legal music services that do exist in some parts of europe are n't available in other parts of the continent .
the single economic market has n't yet translated into a single market for music - songs available legally online in france or ireland may not be available in estonia , malta , or bulgaria . other critics of the music card plan point out that this idea is n't sustainable - giving french youth some free money to spend on music wo n't necessarily change their behavior in the long run . " there is no evidence that this would be useful to anything but bringing a bit more money in the pockets intermediaries of distribution of digital music , " said jeremie zimmerman , a spokesperson for the french online advocacy group la quadrature du net . the french government told european union authorities that it estimates around 1 million cards will be sold per year .
if that holds , that could yield 50 million euros over two years going straight from french taxpayers to the music industry . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 14.10.2010 german historical museum breaks taboos with exhibition on hitler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition looks at representations of hitler from past to present germany has hosted hundreds of exhibitions on the holocaust and nazism , but hitler himself is seldom the focus .
a new exhibition examines the third reich dictator and his relationship to the populace that supported him . billboards with eye-catching images are among museums ' favorite advertising strategies , but when it comes to a major exhibition on hitler in the german capital , the posters are heavy on text and contain no pictures of the third reich 's dictator .
nonetheless , the german historical museum is breaking new ground with its " hitler and the germans - nation and crime , " which opens friday .
the exhibition is the first to focus specifically on the relationship between hitler and the german people during the nazi period , and it breaks with convention in germany by putting hitler at the center .
the exhibition examines the many representations of the nazi leader , from 1930s propaganda posters to recent films that mocked the " fuehrer . "
" hitler and the germans " also includes images and historical objects that demonstrate " the long shadows of hitler 's oppression that extend to the present day " and the broad social acceptance he found , according to the museum 's website .
" just showing images of hitler does n't make any sense , " said historian and exhibition curator hans-ulrich thamer .
" hitler only became what he was in light of the wide-ranging support he received from many parts of society . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leni riefenstahl 's " triumph of the will " -lrb- 1934 -rrb- shows hitler during a speech shifts in attitude thamer explained that germany deals differently with hitler today than in years past , noting an increase in the ways that the dictator is treated with irony or triviality .
those changes correlate with generational shifts , he said .
" the generation that actually experienced national socialism is now no longer represented so strongly .
generations that did n't experience it directly relate to the issue in different ways , " said thamer .
but those shifts in attitude did n't make the museum 's task simple .
great care was taken to ensure that the exhibition in no way crosses over into veneration , said the exhibition curator and museum leadership .
that meant refusing to display a number of objects , including hitler 's uniforms and other possessions , that do n't relate explicitly to the relationship between the dictator and the german people under national socialism .
" we intend for the exhibition to avoid creating the impression of fascination with hitler , and including personal relicts of his opens up that danger , " said museum curator simone erpel in an interview with the dapd news agency .
' fear of their own courage ' the focus on the dictator that sets " hitler and the germans " apart from the countless exhibitions germany has hosted on the holocaust and the nazi era is also what 's drawing attention in the national press .
the spiegel magazine and news portal described the " considerable fear " the german historical museum has evinced in its preparations for the event - " fear of their own courage , " it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a montage of covers from the spiegel magazine depict the former dictator the daily newspaper die welt , on the other hand , pointed to a more prosaic explanation for the museum 's decision not to include images of the dictator in advertisements for the event .
in 1994 , the berlin museum had planned an exhibition on photos taken by hitler 's official photographer christoph stoelzl , which it later had to cancel due to concerns raised over showing placards around the city which bore images of hitler .
this time around , the museum 's marketing team has taken note of that risk .
the exhibition " hitler and the germans " runs from october 15 , 2010 to february 6 , 2011 at the german historical museum .

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .
" what we ’ re dealing with at the moment is cyber espionage and sabotage rather than warfare , which suggests all-out conflict . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers convened for a series of meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
