independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

earlier on saturday , german news magazine der spiegel reported that police had searched six offices in various locations across germany to secure documents relating to the organization of the love parade music festival , where 21 people were crushed to death due to overcrowding .
according to the magazine , police also obtained personal details on those working for or at the event .
negligent manslaughter prosecutors have opened an investigation into negligent manslaughter , but have not yet identified suspects .
schaller , as well as police and local authorities , have been under fire for their handling of the festival .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland has refused to step down despite calls for his resignation .
last monday , more than 300 pages of documents containing details on the planning and organization of the love parade music festival appeared on the internet , and the council was harshly criticized for trying to get an injunction against news portal xtranews.de to stop them being published .
according to spiegel magazine , senior regional police officers had warned schaller about the fact that the venue and , in particular , access to the venue was too small for the number of people expected to attend .
but , the report goes on to say that police were part of a working group , along with the organizers and councillors , which eventually approved the organizer 's security concept .

in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .

the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .

pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .

ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .

ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

" i 'm really worried , because we 've tried together with the league to establish pay tv in germany , but it has n't worked , " rummenigge said , referring to the business model behind sky , the bundesliga 's current broadcasting partner . " they made the mistake … of practically forcing people to take a subscription that linked sport with movies in the same package . " rummenigge said any bundesliga soccer channel would have to earn at least 240 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to make a profit . " that 's something you can forget about , " the former germany international told german newspapers on saturday . german football struggling internationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge does n't think a bundesliga channel would make enough money according to rummenigge , the bundesliga should be trying to convince fans that pay tv can offer something which is not available on public broadcasters .
he said that germany 's clubs would have to increase their tv earnings , otherwise the bundesliga would struggle to compete internationally . " on the transfer market , money is the only criterion , " rummenigge said .
" the bundesliga has been lagging behind for a long time regarding tv income internationally .
we are easily last .
even france earns more . " the german league will earn 1.65 billion euros for the tv rights for the top two divisions over the next four years , an average of 412 million euros a year for the professional clubs . sky pays 225 million euros per year for the pay tv rights .
that will rise to 275 million dollars , but rummenigge suggested this was still too little for such a broadcasting deal . " from the point of view of population and economic power , germany is the biggest country in europe .
that 's why i see no reason why such modest amounts are being paid by television . " author : joanna impey -lrb- dpa / reuters / sid -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier on saturday , german news magazine der spiegel reported that police had searched six offices in various locations across germany to secure documents relating to the organization of the love parade music festival , where 21 people were crushed to death due to overcrowding .
according to the magazine , police also obtained personal details on those working for or at the event .
negligent manslaughter prosecutors have opened an investigation into negligent manslaughter , but have not yet identified suspects .
schaller , as well as police and local authorities , have been under fire for their handling of the festival .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland has refused to step down despite calls for his resignation .
last monday , more than 300 pages of documents containing details on the planning and organization of the love parade music festival appeared on the internet , and the council was harshly criticized for trying to get an injunction against news portal xtranews.de to stop them being published .
according to spiegel magazine , senior regional police officers had warned schaller about the fact that the venue and , in particular , access to the venue was too small for the number of people expected to attend .
but , the report goes on to say that police were part of a working group , along with the organizers and councillors , which eventually approved the organizer 's security concept .

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 21.08.2010 pushing for press freedom in central africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of papers to pick from , but do they tell the truth ?
independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .

the project aims to make the city part of the longest high-speed rail line in europe . in the southern german city of stuttgart , tens of thousands have protested against the planned reconstruction of the central railway station .
up to 30,000 people turned out for the demonstration on friday , august 20 , the biggest thus far . demonstrators marched in silence to the center of the city to rally against one of the biggest infrastructure projects in europe . last week , preliminary work began to clear the exterior of the central station and make way for its transformation .
the station will no longer be a terminus , but an underground through-station , so that trains do not have to go in and out , but can speed right through . supporters say this will reduce travel times , create around 4,000 new jobs and encourage investment .
the aim is to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe - linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project , however , has caused controversy , because many feel it is too expensive .
it will cost around 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- to overhaul the station .
environmental campaigners say the new masterplan is unnecessary and that it will make only a limited change to rail traffic .
the current rail station is a popular landmark in stuttgart , and residents are worried about its becoming redundant . the issue is set to be a major factor in march elections in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which is currently governed by angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

up to 30,000 people turned out for the demonstration on friday , august 20 , the biggest thus far . demonstrators marched in silence to the center of the city to rally against one of the biggest infrastructure projects in europe . last week , preliminary work began to clear the exterior of the central station and make way for its transformation .
the station will no longer be a terminus , but an underground through-station , so that trains do not have to go in and out , but can speed right through . supporters say this will reduce travel times , create around 4,000 new jobs and encourage investment .
the aim is to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe - linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project , however , has caused controversy , because many feel it is too expensive .
it will cost around 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- to overhaul the station .
environmental campaigners say the new masterplan is unnecessary and that it will make only a limited change to rail traffic .
the current rail station is a popular landmark in stuttgart , and residents are worried about its becoming redundant . the issue is set to be a major factor in march elections in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which is currently governed by angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.08.2010 defying west , iran opens nuclear power plant with russian help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr : a symbol of rocky russian-iranian cooperation iran has started loading fuel into its russian-built first nuclear power plant in the face of stiff opposition from the west over its controversial atomic program and despite its rocky ties with moscow . despite broad international criticism , strong doubts about iran 's real intentions , and technical delays , russia 's rosatom state energy corporation has supplied the bushehr nuclear plant on the persian gulf with the fuel rods necessary to begin operations at the reactor . " the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

" i 'm really worried , because we 've tried together with the league to establish pay tv in germany , but it has n't worked , " rummenigge said , referring to the business model behind sky , the bundesliga 's current broadcasting partner . " they made the mistake … of practically forcing people to take a subscription that linked sport with movies in the same package . " rummenigge said any bundesliga soccer channel would have to earn at least 240 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to make a profit . " that 's something you can forget about , " the former germany international told german newspapers on saturday . german football struggling internationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge does n't think a bundesliga channel would make enough money according to rummenigge , the bundesliga should be trying to convince fans that pay tv can offer something which is not available on public broadcasters .
he said that germany 's clubs would have to increase their tv earnings , otherwise the bundesliga would struggle to compete internationally . " on the transfer market , money is the only criterion , " rummenigge said .
" the bundesliga has been lagging behind for a long time regarding tv income internationally .
we are easily last .
even france earns more . " the german league will earn 1.65 billion euros for the tv rights for the top two divisions over the next four years , an average of 412 million euros a year for the professional clubs . sky pays 225 million euros per year for the pay tv rights .
that will rise to 275 million dollars , but rummenigge suggested this was still too little for such a broadcasting deal . " from the point of view of population and economic power , germany is the biggest country in europe .
that 's why i see no reason why such modest amounts are being paid by television . " author : joanna impey -lrb- dpa / reuters / sid -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .

the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

earlier on saturday , german news magazine der spiegel reported that police had searched six offices in various locations across germany to secure documents relating to the organization of the love parade music festival , where 21 people were crushed to death due to overcrowding .
according to the magazine , police also obtained personal details on those working for or at the event .
negligent manslaughter prosecutors have opened an investigation into negligent manslaughter , but have not yet identified suspects .
schaller , as well as police and local authorities , have been under fire for their handling of the festival .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland has refused to step down despite calls for his resignation .
last monday , more than 300 pages of documents containing details on the planning and organization of the love parade music festival appeared on the internet , and the council was harshly criticized for trying to get an injunction against news portal xtranews.de to stop them being published .
according to spiegel magazine , senior regional police officers had warned schaller about the fact that the venue and , in particular , access to the venue was too small for the number of people expected to attend .
but , the report goes on to say that police were part of a working group , along with the organizers and councillors , which eventually approved the organizer 's security concept .

he was engaged to curate germany 's pavilion at the biennale in venice next year .
controversial , but influential schlingensief , who was born in the central german town of oberhausen on 24 october 1960 , was often controversial , but also " one of the most important artists in the country , " according to the director of the museum for modern art in frankfurt , susanne gaensheimer .

he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time .
between 1997 and 2002 , he presented the talk shows talk 2000 and u 3000 .
his struggle with lung cancer was the subject of diaries , describing his treatment and his fear of death in meticulous detail .

they want a dialogue with businesses , not a steady stream of ads . nearly two thirds of germans are disappointed by the way they are engaged by companies in germany who use online social media like facebook and twitter , according to a study released this week by the brand science institute . " higher-ups have not realized that their company 's communication via facebook and twitter needs to be moderated and watched over , " said nils andres , head of the organization , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they 're using facebook and twitter to be part of the social media ecosystem , but they nearly never have a real clear strategy . " and customers have taken notice .
overall , 75 percent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they were disappointed by the lack of real dialogue between companies and their customers , and 83 percent said businesses generally used social media channels for marketing purposes . " from the perspective of the consumer it 's more or less advertising , " andres said .
" from the perspective of researchers it 's not clear what they are doing . " socially inept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies that communicate well offline are often successful online , too just over half -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- of the 1,000 people surveyed said they used social media to reach businesses , and of them 61 percent said they felt the company did not address their concerns , and 47 percent thought the answer they received was insufficient , the study showed .
in many cases consumers said they were simply provided with the company 's hotline number . still , 26 percent agreed that their experience was a positive one , and they had been dealt with in a professional manner . " companies that practice successful customer management in the real world typically do so in social networks as well , " andres said .
" conversely , companies with low customer satisfaction levels tend to confirm their negative image on the social web . " andres pointed to lufthansa and opel 's social media teams , which he said act quickly and provide online followers with helpful information .
at the other end of the spectrum , he said vodafone failed to address the many negative comments and complaints that it received via social media networks . overwhelmed by options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies face a lot of social media choices with the glut of social media options , including facebook , twitter , youtube and blogs to name a few , business need to have a plan before engaging in social media , according to christine perkett , head of the public relations firm perkettpr . " it 's overwhelming to business to think about ' what are we going to do , " ' she told deutsche welle .
" they really need to think about what their business goals are and what their marketing communications goals are and then fit social media into that rather than trying to fit their goals into the use of social media . " companies also stumble over how to fit their new social media activity into traditional corporate structures , andres said . " it 's still that german companies are in the early stages , " he said .
" it 's a little frustrating to see because social media are not a very new phenomenon .
the biggest challenge in the companies is that nobody really knows who is going to handle social media . " author : sam edmonds / sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.08.2010 defying west , iran opens nuclear power plant with russian help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr : a symbol of rocky russian-iranian cooperation iran has started loading fuel into its russian-built first nuclear power plant in the face of stiff opposition from the west over its controversial atomic program and despite its rocky ties with moscow . despite broad international criticism , strong doubts about iran 's real intentions , and technical delays , russia 's rosatom state energy corporation has supplied the bushehr nuclear plant on the persian gulf with the fuel rods necessary to begin operations at the reactor . " the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

the station will no longer be a terminus , but an underground through-station , so that trains do not have to go in and out , but can speed right through . supporters say this will reduce travel times , create around 4,000 new jobs and encourage investment .

" i 'm really worried , because we 've tried together with the league to establish pay tv in germany , but it has n't worked , " rummenigge said , referring to the business model behind sky , the bundesliga 's current broadcasting partner . " they made the mistake … of practically forcing people to take a subscription that linked sport with movies in the same package . " rummenigge said any bundesliga soccer channel would have to earn at least 240 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to make a profit . " that 's something you can forget about , " the former germany international told german newspapers on saturday . german football struggling internationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge does n't think a bundesliga channel would make enough money according to rummenigge , the bundesliga should be trying to convince fans that pay tv can offer something which is not available on public broadcasters .
he said that germany 's clubs would have to increase their tv earnings , otherwise the bundesliga would struggle to compete internationally . " on the transfer market , money is the only criterion , " rummenigge said .
" the bundesliga has been lagging behind for a long time regarding tv income internationally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.08.2010 defying west , iran opens nuclear power plant with russian help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr : a symbol of rocky russian-iranian cooperation iran has started loading fuel into its russian-built first nuclear power plant in the face of stiff opposition from the west over its controversial atomic program and despite its rocky ties with moscow . despite broad international criticism , strong doubts about iran 's real intentions , and technical delays , russia 's rosatom state energy corporation has supplied the bushehr nuclear plant on the persian gulf with the fuel rods necessary to begin operations at the reactor . " the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .

" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.08.2010 defying west , iran opens nuclear power plant with russian help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr : a symbol of rocky russian-iranian cooperation iran has started loading fuel into its russian-built first nuclear power plant in the face of stiff opposition from the west over its controversial atomic program and despite its rocky ties with moscow . despite broad international criticism , strong doubts about iran 's real intentions , and technical delays , russia 's rosatom state energy corporation has supplied the bushehr nuclear plant on the persian gulf with the fuel rods necessary to begin operations at the reactor . " the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

they want a dialogue with businesses , not a steady stream of ads . nearly two thirds of germans are disappointed by the way they are engaged by companies in germany who use online social media like facebook and twitter , according to a study released this week by the brand science institute . " higher-ups have not realized that their company 's communication via facebook and twitter needs to be moderated and watched over , " said nils andres , head of the organization , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they 're using facebook and twitter to be part of the social media ecosystem , but they nearly never have a real clear strategy . " and customers have taken notice .
overall , 75 percent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they were disappointed by the lack of real dialogue between companies and their customers , and 83 percent said businesses generally used social media channels for marketing purposes . " from the perspective of the consumer it 's more or less advertising , " andres said .
" from the perspective of researchers it 's not clear what they are doing . " socially inept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies that communicate well offline are often successful online , too just over half -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- of the 1,000 people surveyed said they used social media to reach businesses , and of them 61 percent said they felt the company did not address their concerns , and 47 percent thought the answer they received was insufficient , the study showed .
in many cases consumers said they were simply provided with the company 's hotline number . still , 26 percent agreed that their experience was a positive one , and they had been dealt with in a professional manner . " companies that practice successful customer management in the real world typically do so in social networks as well , " andres said .
" conversely , companies with low customer satisfaction levels tend to confirm their negative image on the social web . " andres pointed to lufthansa and opel 's social media teams , which he said act quickly and provide online followers with helpful information .
at the other end of the spectrum , he said vodafone failed to address the many negative comments and complaints that it received via social media networks . overwhelmed by options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies face a lot of social media choices with the glut of social media options , including facebook , twitter , youtube and blogs to name a few , business need to have a plan before engaging in social media , according to christine perkett , head of the public relations firm perkettpr . " it 's overwhelming to business to think about ' what are we going to do , " ' she told deutsche welle .
" they really need to think about what their business goals are and what their marketing communications goals are and then fit social media into that rather than trying to fit their goals into the use of social media . " companies also stumble over how to fit their new social media activity into traditional corporate structures , andres said . " it 's still that german companies are in the early stages , " he said .
" it 's a little frustrating to see because social media are not a very new phenomenon .
the biggest challenge in the companies is that nobody really knows who is going to handle social media . " author : sam edmonds / sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier on saturday , german news magazine der spiegel reported that police had searched six offices in various locations across germany to secure documents relating to the organization of the love parade music festival , where 21 people were crushed to death due to overcrowding .
according to the magazine , police also obtained personal details on those working for or at the event .
negligent manslaughter prosecutors have opened an investigation into negligent manslaughter , but have not yet identified suspects .
schaller , as well as police and local authorities , have been under fire for their handling of the festival .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland has refused to step down despite calls for his resignation .
last monday , more than 300 pages of documents containing details on the planning and organization of the love parade music festival appeared on the internet , and the council was harshly criticized for trying to get an injunction against news portal xtranews.de to stop them being published .
according to spiegel magazine , senior regional police officers had warned schaller about the fact that the venue and , in particular , access to the venue was too small for the number of people expected to attend .
but , the report goes on to say that police were part of a working group , along with the organizers and councillors , which eventually approved the organizer 's security concept .

earlier on saturday , german news magazine der spiegel reported that police had searched six offices in various locations across germany to secure documents relating to the organization of the love parade music festival , where 21 people were crushed to death due to overcrowding .
according to the magazine , police also obtained personal details on those working for or at the event .
negligent manslaughter prosecutors have opened an investigation into negligent manslaughter , but have not yet identified suspects .
schaller , as well as police and local authorities , have been under fire for their handling of the festival .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland has refused to step down despite calls for his resignation .
last monday , more than 300 pages of documents containing details on the planning and organization of the love parade music festival appeared on the internet , and the council was harshly criticized for trying to get an injunction against news portal xtranews.de to stop them being published .
according to spiegel magazine , senior regional police officers had warned schaller about the fact that the venue and , in particular , access to the venue was too small for the number of people expected to attend .
but , the report goes on to say that police were part of a working group , along with the organizers and councillors , which eventually approved the organizer 's security concept .

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

earlier on saturday , german news magazine der spiegel reported that police had searched six offices in various locations across germany to secure documents relating to the organization of the love parade music festival , where 21 people were crushed to death due to overcrowding .
according to the magazine , police also obtained personal details on those working for or at the event .
negligent manslaughter prosecutors have opened an investigation into negligent manslaughter , but have not yet identified suspects .
schaller , as well as police and local authorities , have been under fire for their handling of the festival .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland has refused to step down despite calls for his resignation .
last monday , more than 300 pages of documents containing details on the planning and organization of the love parade music festival appeared on the internet , and the council was harshly criticized for trying to get an injunction against news portal xtranews.de to stop them being published .
according to spiegel magazine , senior regional police officers had warned schaller about the fact that the venue and , in particular , access to the venue was too small for the number of people expected to attend .
but , the report goes on to say that police were part of a working group , along with the organizers and councillors , which eventually approved the organizer 's security concept .

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

" i 'm really worried , because we 've tried together with the league to establish pay tv in germany , but it has n't worked , " rummenigge said , referring to the business model behind sky , the bundesliga 's current broadcasting partner . " they made the mistake … of practically forcing people to take a subscription that linked sport with movies in the same package . " rummenigge said any bundesliga soccer channel would have to earn at least 240 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to make a profit . " that 's something you can forget about , " the former germany international told german newspapers on saturday . german football struggling internationally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge does n't think a bundesliga channel would make enough money according to rummenigge , the bundesliga should be trying to convince fans that pay tv can offer something which is not available on public broadcasters .
he said that germany 's clubs would have to increase their tv earnings , otherwise the bundesliga would struggle to compete internationally . " on the transfer market , money is the only criterion , " rummenigge said .
" the bundesliga has been lagging behind for a long time regarding tv income internationally .
we are easily last .
even france earns more . " the german league will earn 1.65 billion euros for the tv rights for the top two divisions over the next four years , an average of 412 million euros a year for the professional clubs . sky pays 225 million euros per year for the pay tv rights .
that will rise to 275 million dollars , but rummenigge suggested this was still too little for such a broadcasting deal . " from the point of view of population and economic power , germany is the biggest country in europe .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time .
between 1997 and 2002 , he presented the talk shows talk 2000 and u 3000 .
his struggle with lung cancer was the subject of diaries , describing his treatment and his fear of death in meticulous detail .

six magic minutes peniel mlapa coolly slotted the ball past germany keeper tim wiese in the 37th minute and , on 41 minutes , bosnian vedad ibisevic converted a pass from brazilian midfielder luiz gustavo .
just two minutes later , ibisevic 's international colleague sejad salihovic curled in a free kick to bring the score to 4-1 at half time , with the second half goalless .
" the team was totally unfazed by the penalty and to lead 4-1 at half-time is just fantastic , in the second-half we went off the boil , but the game was won , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.08.2010 defying west , iran opens nuclear power plant with russian help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr : a symbol of rocky russian-iranian cooperation iran has started loading fuel into its russian-built first nuclear power plant in the face of stiff opposition from the west over its controversial atomic program and despite its rocky ties with moscow . despite broad international criticism , strong doubts about iran 's real intentions , and technical delays , russia 's rosatom state energy corporation has supplied the bushehr nuclear plant on the persian gulf with the fuel rods necessary to begin operations at the reactor . " the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue . germany 's consumer affairs minister , who has been sharply criticizing us company google for months over its street view service , has urged the internet giant to reveal the number of germans who are opting out of the online photo gallery .
" for months , the opt-outs have been piling up , " aigner told the german newspaper rheinische post .
" but we are still not being told how many letters from the citizens of germany have been delivered to google so far . "
google has announced an eight-week period to allow germans to request exterior images of their houses be blurred before the street view service goes live .
street view allows internet users to see panoramic images of street frontages and take a virtual walk through maps .
it has already been introduced in more than 20 other countries with little fuss .
similar services are already available in germany on websites like bing .
german press campaigned for opt-out however , the german media have been hostile to google , suggesting the images could be used by burglars .
google rejected the criticism , with the head of google 's european operations , philipp schindler , insisting there is nothing to fear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilse aigner wants google to show more transparency " we pay close attention to people 's privacy , " he told the mass-market bild newspaper .
" but there is nothing more public than the front of your house . "
consumer affairs minister aigner said it would be simple for google to count the number of opt-outs it has received so far .
" google has this ambition to make the world more transparent .
so i would welcome it if the company would show more transparency itself , " she said .

the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .

the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .

he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .

ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .

the project aims to make the city part of the longest high-speed rail line in europe . in the southern german city of stuttgart , tens of thousands have protested against the planned reconstruction of the central railway station .
up to 30,000 people turned out for the demonstration on friday , august 20 , the biggest thus far . demonstrators marched in silence to the center of the city to rally against one of the biggest infrastructure projects in europe . last week , preliminary work began to clear the exterior of the central station and make way for its transformation .
the station will no longer be a terminus , but an underground through-station , so that trains do not have to go in and out , but can speed right through . supporters say this will reduce travel times , create around 4,000 new jobs and encourage investment .
the aim is to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe - linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project , however , has caused controversy , because many feel it is too expensive .
it will cost around 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- to overhaul the station .
environmental campaigners say the new masterplan is unnecessary and that it will make only a limited change to rail traffic .
the current rail station is a popular landmark in stuttgart , and residents are worried about its becoming redundant . the issue is set to be a major factor in march elections in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , which is currently governed by angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 21.08.2010 defying west , iran opens nuclear power plant with russian help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr : a symbol of rocky russian-iranian cooperation iran has started loading fuel into its russian-built first nuclear power plant in the face of stiff opposition from the west over its controversial atomic program and despite its rocky ties with moscow . despite broad international criticism , strong doubts about iran 's real intentions , and technical delays , russia 's rosatom state energy corporation has supplied the bushehr nuclear plant on the persian gulf with the fuel rods necessary to begin operations at the reactor . " the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .

he was engaged to curate germany 's pavilion at the biennale in venice next year .
controversial , but influential schlingensief , who was born in the central german town of oberhausen on 24 october 1960 , was often controversial , but also " one of the most important artists in the country , " according to the director of the museum for modern art in frankfurt , susanne gaensheimer .

he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time .
between 1997 and 2002 , he presented the talk shows talk 2000 and u 3000 .
his struggle with lung cancer was the subject of diaries , describing his treatment and his fear of death in meticulous detail .
he is survived by his wife and long-time assistant aino laberenz .

" the operation of transferring nuclear fuel to the reactor was carried out on 30th of mordad -lrb- august 21 -rrb- in presence of ali akbar salehi , vice president and head of iran 's atomic body , and sergei kiriyenko , " a statement by iran 's atomic energy organisation said on saturday , august 21 .
for moscow , it is a signal that it values good relations with iran .
nevertheless bilateral ties remain on an uncertain footing .
a year ago , everything was looking good from the perspective of iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
at the height of protests rejecting the results of the country 's purportedly rigged presidential election , he traveled to russia for the so-called shanghai conference in yekaterinenburg .
ahmadinejad was received by his russian counterpart , dmitri medvedev , with open arms and , despite the controversial outcome of the iranian vote , warmly congratulated on his re-election .
many iranians are wary of moscow the effusive welcome left much of the international community miffed and was met with outright scorn by the iranian opposition .
crowds of demonstrators chanted " death to russia " after the reception in yekaterinenburg .
for historical reasons , many iranians are skeptical about relations with russia .
one protester told german radio that he was concerned about the unexpected rapprochement .
" before the october revolution , and after several wars , russia annexed a large part of iran .
during the soviet era , the ussr massively interfered in iran 's domestic affairs through a proxy party .
and now , a lot of iranians think that russia is using the islamic republic again for its global political aims .
these are all reasons why people here are very sensitive , " the protester said .
britain and the united states , meanwhile , reiterated their concerns on saturday over iran 's nuclear program .
" until iran suspends its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and responds in full to iaea concerns about potential military dimensions , it will be in contravention of six unsc -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolutions and have to bear the economic cost of sanctions , " a foreign office minister said in london .
israel on saturday denounced iran 's fueling up of its first nuclear power plant as " totally unacceptable " and called for more international pressure to force tehran to cease any uranium enrichment .
bildunterschrift : the west is concerned that the bushehr plant could help iran produce weapons-grade uranium bushehr is a symbol of power politics both countries , however , benefit from each other .
moscow knows , for example , that as long as the controversy swirling around iran 's nuclear program continues , the less time us president barack obama will have to focus on russian foreign policy .
for tehran , its partnership with moscow is important because russia is a permanent member of the un security council and this means that it can block new sanctions against the islamic republic .
this plays an important role in russia 's involvement with the bushehr nuclear power station .
in 1995 , moscow pledged to complete the plant , which was started in 1975 by german engineering giant siemens , and get it up and running .
the original plan called for a start in 2004 but that date was repeatedly postponed .
when russia 's energy minister last year said that the plant could only start up this spring , tehran lost patience .
a spokesman for the parliamentary security committee blustered that russia had been " toying with iran for the last 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without russia , ahmadinejad would be very much alone the anger and disappointment in tehran was understandable .
after all , president ahmadinejad has been hoping for much more than just the 1,000 megawatts from bushehr .
" we are determined to expand and develop our nuclear power plants across the country to 20,000 megawatts , " ahmadinejad told a rally earlier this year .
sore points remain this spring , ahmadinejad accused russia of taking a pro-american position on new sanctions toward iran .
anti-russian tirades could be heard in parliament with one popular deputy , ali motahari , demanding that tehran increase its support for the moslems in chechnya .
moscow responded angrily , accusing iran of political agitation and ultimately voting in favor of new sanctions against tehran .
but , just because the bushehr reactor is now starting to generate electricity , does not mean that russian-iranian relations are back on track .
there is another sore point that severely annoys tehran .
moscow is continuing to refuse to deliver a promised air defense missile system .
the modern s-300 ground-to-air batteries could prove more important to tehran than starting up a long-awaited nuclear reactor , which - fearing iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons - israel has threatened to destroy .

he said that germany 's clubs would have to increase their tv earnings , otherwise the bundesliga would struggle to compete internationally . " on the transfer market , money is the only criterion , " rummenigge said .
" the bundesliga has been lagging behind for a long time regarding tv income internationally .
we are easily last .
even france earns more . " the german league will earn 1.65 billion euros for the tv rights for the top two divisions over the next four years , an average of 412 million euros a year for the professional clubs . sky pays 225 million euros per year for the pay tv rights .
that will rise to 275 million dollars , but rummenigge suggested this was still too little for such a broadcasting deal . " from the point of view of population and economic power , germany is the biggest country in europe .

independent and free media is not a given in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
however , as the country starts to think about next year 's presidential elections , it is fast becoming a necessity . no news is good news , it seems , if it comes from the drc .
the kind of western headlines that make mention of the vast central african country focus on corruption , mineral conflicts , war , mass-scale rape and slavery of women , and most recently the ambush and brutal murder of three united nations peacekeepers .
there is a lot to report on , but as the dcr 's low ranking in the press freedom index compiled by reporters without borders underscores , it is not a place where journalists have the freedom to say and write what they want .
in 2009 , the african country stood at 146th place in the table of 175 nations .
ambroise pierre , head of the africa desk of the paris-based reporters without borders , told deutsche welle that journalists working in the democratic republic of congo are frequently silenced by intimidation and brutality , and sometimes even by murder .
at least eight people are known to have been killed across the country for their reporting activities since 2005 .
in some cases legal proceedings have never been initiated , in others trials failed to meet international standards and left the reporting community with the message that the judicial system does not have their backs .
" it is extremely dangerous to be a journalist in the drc because the people who are enemies of press freedom have very few limits , " pierre said .
play safe , say nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese soldiers outside a camp for those displaced by war pierre says the situation in eastern congo is particularly taboo and media organizations daring enough to cover such stories as army mutinies or levels of discontent among unpaid soldiers could well find their offices the targets of raids by military officials .
the only way to play safe is to keep quiet about things people do n't want to hear .
and newspapers instinctively know what that is .
but some are not prepared to keep quiet about what is happening in the country they live in .
one such is ' l 'observateur ' , a daily established and published by one-time congolese ambassador mankenda voka whose travels around the world opened his eyes to the scope for involving the public in political debate .
as far as he was concerned , his fellow countrymen and women were the least well-informed in all of africa .
" i realized that if i wanted to help my country i would have to do something to help stimulate ideas , " he said , adding that there are simply not enough independent publications in the drc .
private mouthpiece which is not to say there is a general dearth of media in the third-largest nation in africa .
pierre says it is home to countless newspapers and television and radio stations , but that the journalists working for them are often polarized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from an opposition rally ahead of the 2006 presidential elections " most of them belong to political parties or are attached to candidates that create media outlets as a means of communicating their own interests . "
he cites the run-up to the 2006 presidential elections - the first free poll in the democratic republic of congo since gaining independence from belgium in 1960 - as a prime example of the way the country 's press apparatus works .
back then electoral candidates , local governments and governors were busy establishing their own media organizations .
and with only a little over a year to go before the next presidential ballot , he said there is some evidence of that trend being repeated in the race to succeed the current president joseph kabila .
governors in some regions in the east are already setting up newspapers and radio stations to get their messages out to the electorate .
the challenge ahead mankenda voka , however , is not happy to leave it up to non-independent journalists to do the job alone .
" we have a lot of political parties and there are a lot of people who want to be president , " he said .
" we are a democracy , which means everybody deserves a chance . "
earlier in the week , etienne tshisekedi of the opposition union for social development and progress told a belgian newspaper that he would challenge kabila in 2011 .
his party boycotted the previous ballot , which he described then as now , as a ' masquerade . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is a major problem in the democratic republic of congo reporters without borders also see the upcoming elections as a chance to highlight the problems facing journalists .
ahead of the celebrations staged in kinshasa to mark the democratic republic of congo 's 50th anniversary of independence , the organization called on the international community to " work together to improve the climate for journalists . "
ambroise pierre says they face a long path ahead , but that they will continue taking steady steps down it .
" we will keep pushing to get the drc 's partners to pressure kinshasa for improvements , " he said .
" we have not managed to secure change yet , but the partners hear us and they know we are pressuring them . "
