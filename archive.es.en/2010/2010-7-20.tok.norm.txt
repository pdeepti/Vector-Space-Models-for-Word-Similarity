in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .
good for a few , bad for the rest few locals are invited to work on the farms and with poor fishing yields , as a result of the decimation of their natural habitats , whole communities are suddenly unable to sustain themselves .
jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .
" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "
it is a lot to have to forego so that a handful of individuals can make a sack of cash , and it 's not even the whole picture .
weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dense foliage helps break the wind and water fall their tangled mass of roots , shoots and branches act as a buffer for fierce storms rolling in from the sea , and spalding even goes so far as to say that mangroves have what it takes to slow down the frightening process of rising sea levels .
" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .
tanzania has put all its mangroves under protection , and new trees and shrubs have been planted or encouraged to grow through measures such as waste removal in a range of other countries including australia , brazil , cuba , indonesia , philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaches of an uninhabited island washed away in the 2004 tsunami map works with local people in thailand on what it calls ecological mangrove restoration , a strategy which entails a detailed historical analysis of the soil and hydrological requirements before planting .
enright says this enhances the chances of successful growth of seeds swept in on the tides , thereby recreating the same richly biodiverse eco-systems of old .
however , getting to the coastal regions in need of gentle cultivation is easier said than done .
talking of the difficulties in gaining access to land abandoned by shrimp farmers , enright said there are a lot of ownership hurdles to be cleared before restoration can begin .
but he and others like him are dedicated to the task in hand .
" on the whole people are doing the right thing , " spalding said .
" but mangroves are still declining too fast and we would be doing the world and ourselves a favor if we would just stop chopping down mangroves altogether . "

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "
wherever oil exploration takes place , companies and shareholders rake in profits while the local population is often left on its own to bear the environmental and social costs that arise .
and those costs , according to greenpeace 's cindy baxter , will be passed on from today 's generation to tomorrow 's .
" if you dig on any beach in prince william sound , you will find oil .
species and fisheries there have never recovered , " she said .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "

die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .
good for a few , bad for the rest few locals are invited to work on the farms and with poor fishing yields , as a result of the decimation of their natural habitats , whole communities are suddenly unable to sustain themselves .
jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.07.2010 paying for their messes : the record for oil companies is n't stellar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exxon valdez spilled more than 270,000 barrels of crude oil in prince william sound people affected by the exxon valdez oil-spill disaster had to wait two decades before being compensated .
it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "
wherever oil exploration takes place , companies and shareholders rake in profits while the local population is often left on its own to bear the environmental and social costs that arise .
and those costs , according to greenpeace 's cindy baxter , will be passed on from today 's generation to tomorrow 's .
" if you dig on any beach in prince william sound , you will find oil .
species and fisheries there have never recovered , " she said .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "

die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 20.07.2010 despite rumors of its demise , the us-uk special relationship is alive , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before they became leaders of their countries , david cameron met barack obama in london david cameron has repeatedly called for a british foreign policy that is more independent from the us .
but during his first official white house trip , expect both leaders to stress the special bond between their nations . when the leader of britain 's conservative party , david cameron , in a 2006 speech in washington , criticised his country 's " slavish " relationship with the us , he ruffled some feathers .
baroness thatcher , the former prime minister and conservative icon , who happened to be in the us at the time as well , issued a rebuke through the white house , reiterating that britain stood by the us " in the front line against islamist fanatics who hate our beliefs , our liberties and our citizens . "
four years later , david cameron has moved into number 10 downing street and on tuesday will visit president barack obama for the first time officially in the white house .
and while prime minister cameron has n't repeated the word slavish to characterize the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states , just before leaving for the us he reiterated the inequality of the british-american relationship : " we should always be conscious of the fact that we 're the junior partner in this relationship and america is a pacific power as well as an atlantic power . "
cooler approach instead of focusing too much on the us , cameron wants to develop deeper ties with other countries ; for example , he wants to forge a new special relationship with india .
washington for its part has reacted coolly to cameron 's verbal recalibration of transatlantic ties .
barack obama , unlike many of his predecessors , is considered to have no special fondness towards britain , and according to media reports was rather put off by former prime minister gordon brown 's continued efforts to score ' face time ' with him .
in any case , obama is dealing with so many pressing issues , that the nature of the relationship with britain probably does n't rank very high on his priority list .
but while cameron and obama try to play down its importance , the so-called special relationship is , in fact , alive and well . " the special relationship is a funny term , " says klaus larres , an expert on british and us foreign policy , currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies -lrb- sais -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington .
" every prime minister and every president confirms that this special relationship does exist , but at the same time the media usually say that there is no special relationship left . "
larres contends that there is indeed something like a special relationship between britain and the united states that is independent of the leaders currently in power .
security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron criticised the relationship tony blair developed with george w. bush " and that usually refers to the defense cooperation , particularly to intelligence cooperation " , says larres .
" one really has to say that the exchange and information about intelligence between the two countries is probably as close as with no other country .
so in that respect the special relationship does exist . "
michael williams , an expert in transatlantic relations at royal holloway college , university of london , agrees : " the special relationship as it relates to the close political , military and intelligence cooperation between the uk and the us is undoubtedly just as strong under obama and cameron as it was under thatcher and reagan . "
for williams , cameron 's remarks about not being ' slavish ' to the us and the importance of developing closer ties with other nations " were largely political pandering " .
of course , london needs to built stronger ties with other countries , he adds .
" but to believe for example that the uk and india can develop the same sort of closeness in their relationship as the us and the uk is a bit of a stretch . "
so while the special relationship is real , it should n't be mistaken for a blissful consensus on global issues .
in fact there are often quite serious differences between london and washington on major topics .
and those differences could even increase in the future , says larres .
" there are policy areas where both men have to differ because their countries have to take different positions in the world . "
anglo-american tiff the most recent rift between the white house and downing street was over bp , played out in public and which , depending on developments in the gulf of mexico , may even continue .
bildunterschrift : the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico has caused some tensions between the us and the uk " cameron was seriously annoyed when obama for example did not refer to bp in one press remark " , says larres , " but used the old term british petroleum , which of course clearly puts the ball in the court of the british and the responsibility for the whole mess not just in the court of the company , but on britain as a country . "
there are other issues for potential future clashes between the us and the uk .
one could be britain 's strong austerity measures which washington views as counterproductive .
another could be afghanistan where the us urgently needs a war-weary britain to stay on as its most important ally .
but despite some possible disagreements and efforts to rebalance and modernize their transatlantic ties , the experts do n't expect david cameron and barack obama to discard the special relationship anytime soon because it simply is n't in their interest .
so somewhere in their communique , after the president and the prime minister 's three hour meeting on tuesday , we can be sure to find the phrase ' special relationship ' once again .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "
wherever oil exploration takes place , companies and shareholders rake in profits while the local population is often left on its own to bear the environmental and social costs that arise .
and those costs , according to greenpeace 's cindy baxter , will be passed on from today 's generation to tomorrow 's .
" if you dig on any beach in prince william sound , you will find oil .
species and fisheries there have never recovered , " she said .

the meissen factory focuses on artisanship and tradition and hopes that this emphasis will help it beat economic woes . to mark its 300th anniversary this year , porcelain manufacturer meissen announced it would sell 10 special edition clocks at prices of 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 129,000 -rrb- each .
that might stun the average buyer , but the clocks sold out immediately - with an additional 30 orders placed that could not be filled .
" issuing 10 clocks was n't just a marketing trick or an arbitrary limited edition , " explained meissen 's ceo christian kurtzke .
" it reflects the number of clocks we 'll actually be able to finish in a year . "
that 's because meissen still relies on its traditional production methods as europe 's oldest porcelain maker .
the porcelain is crafted from scratch and painted entirely in-house by specialists who have trained for years at the factory in eastern germany .
the company 's emphasis on tradition may have helped save it from bankruptcy , despite the problems that have plagued the luxury industry following the global financial crisis .
other porcelain producers like wedgwood in england and subsidiary rosenthal in germany have declared bankruptcy in the last few years .
bildunterschrift : the chronos 300 , meissen 's anniversary clock , includes a series of motifs inspired by asian art 30 years experience required for ceo kurtzke , the clocks are works of art .
just five employees are authorized to craft the chronos 300 , and each employee has at least 30 to 40 years of experience designing porcelain .
they are part of a production process that has resisted globalization .
no step in the porcelain manufacture has been outsourced , and the artists employed at meissen are typically drawn from the region .
after an apprenticeship that lasts more than three years , an artist may be hired , typically specializing in a single motif , like flowers , birds or oriental patterns .
" the porcelain makers here are proud , not only because we work for the oldest porcelain manufacturer in europe , but it 's also an honor to have enough skill for the job , " said one artist who paints porcelain at meissen .
alchemy and ' white gold ' around 10,000 colors are available for the artists to use in painting .
each color is produced locally at laboratories in meissen - just like the porcelain itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meissen artists combine numerous porcelain pieces to form intricate designs that 's a tradition that dates back 300 years to polish king augustus the strong .
fascinated by the porcelain imported from asia , he pressed an alchemist to discover the secret behind " white gold . "
within 10 years , they had succeeded , and the meissen factory was born in 1710 .
" this story of discovery and the characters involved make the background to the factory very interesting and the products themselves very innovative and unusual , " said rodney woolley , a porcelain expert at christie 's auction house in london .
" it also makes meissen one of the best known brands in the world . "
the company 's history and brand name recognition have contributed to some hefty auction prices in recent years , including the sale of two 16-inch meissen candelabras for 337,000 euros and two bird figurines for 169,000 euros last december in an auction hosted by christie 's in paris .
weathering the storm despite having weathered the economic crisis well with stable sales in 2009 and 30 percent sales growth so far in 2010 , meissen has faced financial problems in recent years .
in july , the company announced job cuts amounting to nearly a fourth of the current staff , and changes are being planned in the product lines and how they are marketed .
nevertheless , kurtzke is preserving the traditions at the core of the company .
the job cuts will be made among the administrative staff rather than among the artists , and the porcelain will continue to be crafted individually at meissen 's factory .
bildunterschrift : meissen 's " fuerstenzug " in dresden depicts nobility and other figures from saxony 's history though popularly associated with dishware or small sculptures , the company hopes to expand its appeal for upscale interior design pieces .
" we view our primary field as the entire home and the entire home interior , from floor to ceiling - and especially in the architectural arena , we see a lot of potential for growth , " kurtzke said .
architectural products may include porcelain tile to be used in bathroom floors or walls .
as a waterproof material , porcelain can even be used for wall mountings that must face the elements , like the famous fuerstenzug frieze on the outer wall of a dresden palace made from meissen 's porcelain .
but not everyone is convinced by the company 's innovations .
one guest at the factory 's year-long retrospective exhibition had a clear preference for the older pieces on display .
" the newer pieces are n't as pretty - and there are a few out there that i would n't buy even if i were a millionaire ! " she said .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .
good for a few , bad for the rest few locals are invited to work on the farms and with poor fishing yields , as a result of the decimation of their natural habitats , whole communities are suddenly unable to sustain themselves .
jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .
" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "
it is a lot to have to forego so that a handful of individuals can make a sack of cash , and it 's not even the whole picture .
weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dense foliage helps break the wind and water fall their tangled mass of roots , shoots and branches act as a buffer for fierce storms rolling in from the sea , and spalding even goes so far as to say that mangroves have what it takes to slow down the frightening process of rising sea levels .
" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .
tanzania has put all its mangroves under protection , and new trees and shrubs have been planted or encouraged to grow through measures such as waste removal in a range of other countries including australia , brazil , cuba , indonesia , philippines and thailand .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

in the balkans , summer brings a new wave of cash . a sport aircraft painted in the serb national colors - white , blue and red - speeds over the bumpy grass runway , climbs into the air and performs a short set of air acrobatics , before coming in for a smooth landing .
out steps milorad matic . the 37-year-old not only owns the plane , but also the firm aero-east-europe , an airplane manufacturer he founded three years ago in the city of kraljevo , serbia . twenty years ago , matic left his country in hopes of making a living in the west .
he worked on construction sites in northern italy , and later founded his own construction company in germany .
he also fulfilled a childhood dream and took flying lessons .
with money earned in italy and germany , and know-how from italy and the czech republic , he then returned to serbia .
today , he employs 25 mechanics and engineers .
a patriotic duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government encourages investment in serbia if you live abroad , matic says , you feel much more patriotic .
" if you are here , you do n't miss your country .
but if you 're not , you feel drawn back to it , and you feel this patriotic pain , " he said . the businessman says he invested in serbia out of love for his native country .
he supported his family and friends long before that , when he still lived in the west - as many serbs who work in italy , germany , austria or switzerland do , matic says .
" they send money .
without these transfers , many families could not even survive .
or you bring money in .
or you try to build up something , " he said .
newly constructed buildings have sprung up across the balkans , houses for the entire extended family , built with the money migrants regularly send home .
important social net " we believe that most of the money goes to the poorest families , " said marco mantovaneli , head of the world bank 's bosnian bureau in sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mantovaneli says migrant workers create a social security net " by supporting the family members who stayed behind , migrant workers take on the important role of a social security net , " he said . international experts estimate that in bosnia and herzegovina , such bank transfers account for more than 15 percent of the gross domestic product - more than $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.93 billion euros -rrb- last year alone . vendors selling their goods at sarajevo 's central market profit , too .
nerima sells flowers here , and is lucky that her cousins emigrated to the united states years ago .
several times a year , they send her a few hundred us dollars .
nerima says they ca n't send more ; they have to pay off a loan .
" i hope they can send more when they are better off so that we can survive , " she said .
" selling flowers , sometimes we do n't even make enough to buy dinner . "
fewer money transfers due to the financial crisis a man at a neraby vegetable stand is also dissatisfied .
his brothers and sisters in germany have become more tightfisted because of the economic crisis .
" they say they are doing worse than we are because they do n't have work , " he said .
" sometimes they help a little bit , and send 10 euros or so . "
last year , the world bank warned that the poor could be hardest hit by the global financial crisis and its effects ; the economic and social structures of many nations could break down without the money transfers from migrant workers . last year , these transfers did in fact drop by about 20 percent .
in bosnia , transfers dropped by about half a billion dollars from 2008 .
serbia , though , was not hit quite as hard .
since 2004 , the world bank estimates that migrant workers have pumped about $ 30 billion into that country .
send us money , but do n't come home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : selling vegetables and flowers is not profitable enough returnees who invest in their country often encounter corruption and mismanagement .
firms often go broke because of local problems , says airplane constructor matic .
" you invest everything you 've saved , and it 's your downfall , " he said , adding that corruption and mismanagement have cost him one million euros .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .

jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .
" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "

weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .

" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .

enright says this enhances the chances of successful growth of seeds swept in on the tides , thereby recreating the same richly biodiverse eco-systems of old .
however , getting to the coastal regions in need of gentle cultivation is easier said than done .
talking of the difficulties in gaining access to land abandoned by shrimp farmers , enright said there are a lot of ownership hurdles to be cleared before restoration can begin .
but he and others like him are dedicated to the task in hand .
" on the whole people are doing the right thing , " spalding said .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.07.2010 afghans to take over security responsibility by 2014 : kabul conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major world leaders attended the kabul meeting the international conference on afghanistan in kabul has approved a plan to hand over security responsibility to afghan forces by 2014 .
it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

loew then said he would leave his decision until after the world cup .
football icons upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has backed loew 's new deal the reappointment has been broadly welcomed by the country 's football community , with former national team coach rudi voeller calling it a " very good decision by all involved . "
voeller said maintaining the unity of the national coaching team , including flick and goalkeeping coach andreas koepke , was a positive development for german football .
" the fact that all four are staying is great , " he said .
" now the development of the last few years with the young , talented team can continue .
the basis for the future is there . "
senior national team member michael ballack , whose captaincy of die mannschaft has been under question after he was replaced by philipp lahm at the world cup , also praised loew 's re-appointment .
" i 'm happy the team will remain united .
it has performed excellently together , " said ballack , who returns to the bundesliga this season with his old club bayer leverkusen .
dfb president theo zwanziger , meanwhile , has left his own future open following loew 's contract extension .
the dfb executive committee is to due to deliberate over the presidency in october .
" -lsb- loew 's new deal -rsb- could have some influence , but it 's not vital , " zwanziger said in frankfurt .
" now , i 'm going to spend some time reflecting .
i will think calmly about what is right for the association and what is right for me . "
loew came to prominence as national assistance coach in the lead-up to the 2006 world cup in germany under then-head coach juergen klinsmann .
he assumed the top job when klinsmann stepped down following that tournament .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .

undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .

" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "
it is a lot to have to forego so that a handful of individuals can make a sack of cash , and it 's not even the whole picture .
weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dense foliage helps break the wind and water fall their tangled mass of roots , shoots and branches act as a buffer for fierce storms rolling in from the sea , and spalding even goes so far as to say that mangroves have what it takes to slow down the frightening process of rising sea levels .
" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .
tanzania has put all its mangroves under protection , and new trees and shrubs have been planted or encouraged to grow through measures such as waste removal in a range of other countries including australia , brazil , cuba , indonesia , philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaches of an uninhabited island washed away in the 2004 tsunami map works with local people in thailand on what it calls ecological mangrove restoration , a strategy which entails a detailed historical analysis of the soil and hydrological requirements before planting .
enright says this enhances the chances of successful growth of seeds swept in on the tides , thereby recreating the same richly biodiverse eco-systems of old .
however , getting to the coastal regions in need of gentle cultivation is easier said than done .
talking of the difficulties in gaining access to land abandoned by shrimp farmers , enright said there are a lot of ownership hurdles to be cleared before restoration can begin .
but he and others like him are dedicated to the task in hand .
" on the whole people are doing the right thing , " spalding said .
" but mangroves are still declining too fast and we would be doing the world and ourselves a favor if we would just stop chopping down mangroves altogether . "

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .

" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .

" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 20.07.2010 broccoli and tomato patents under scrutiny at european patent office großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weapon in the fight against cancer : broccoli at the european patent office in munich , there are some tasty patents on the table for debate .
the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

and those who expose police corruption live dangerously . two men in black threw petrol bombs at the head office of " tempo " magazine in jakarta earlier this month .
no one was hurt and no significant damage was done to the building . through its investigative journalism about corruption involving politicians , businessmen and the police , " tempo " magazine has made many powerful enemies in the past .
the june edition of the magazine featured a cover story with the title " the fat bank accounts of police officers " .
the cover depicts a policeman leading three pig-shaped money boxes on leashes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard walks outside the office of tempo magazine in jakarta intimidation attempts " we are not sure , but obviously either it is people who are unhappy with our investigations into alleged illegal payments to high ranking officers in the police force or people who want to stir trouble , " bambang harymurti , the ceo and chief editor of " tempo " , told deutsche welle about who might be behind the attack .
" it 's probably not from the police as an institution but rather from some police officers who are not very happy with our report .
i think they want to send a message not to mess with us or continue this kind of reporting .
this is an initial attempt to try to clamp down on press freedom . " two days after the attack on the magazine , an indonesian anti-graft activist was also attacked .
tama langkun from indonesia corruption watch was hit on the head as he rode back home on a motorcycle , apparently for speaking out against police corruption . these kinds of attacks remind indonesians of the autocratic suharto regime and raise questions about the strength of the country 's democracy .
bambang harymurti described the consequences : " i 'm sure it has an effect on our work .
at tempo , we make sure it will strengthen our resolve to fight corruption , but i 'm sure it has an effect on people .
it creates an environment of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is the third time in a row that the indonesian police has been rated as most corrupt rampant police corruption corruption is known to be worst amongst the police and the judiciary in indonesia .
according to transparency international indonesia , police have now topped the corruption list for the third time in a row .
more than half of all interactions with police are estimated to involve the payment of bribes . as bambang harymurti from " tempo " magazine explained , " recently because of the reform process , the military in indonesia have lost power and the police have gained a lot of power .
in indonesia the problem is that our entire corruption agency has to rely on the police .
therefore it is difficult for the corruption agency to investigate the police .
another reason that the police are corrupt is that they do not have enough money for their operations and police officers only have a meagre salary . " adnan topan husodo , vice- coordinator of indonesian corruption watch , added , " we know that in some areas , the government has introduced some progressive reforms within the police force as an institution .
but we know that the reform is not good enough .
there are still problems in the way the police function . " president susilo bambang yudhoyono has asked the police to investigate the latest attacks .
but in view of the nature of the problem it appears highly unlikely that this approach will lead to the culprits being caught . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .
good for a few , bad for the rest few locals are invited to work on the farms and with poor fishing yields , as a result of the decimation of their natural habitats , whole communities are suddenly unable to sustain themselves .
jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .
" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "
it is a lot to have to forego so that a handful of individuals can make a sack of cash , and it 's not even the whole picture .
weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dense foliage helps break the wind and water fall their tangled mass of roots , shoots and branches act as a buffer for fierce storms rolling in from the sea , and spalding even goes so far as to say that mangroves have what it takes to slow down the frightening process of rising sea levels .
" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .
tanzania has put all its mangroves under protection , and new trees and shrubs have been planted or encouraged to grow through measures such as waste removal in a range of other countries including australia , brazil , cuba , indonesia , philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaches of an uninhabited island washed away in the 2004 tsunami map works with local people in thailand on what it calls ecological mangrove restoration , a strategy which entails a detailed historical analysis of the soil and hydrological requirements before planting .
enright says this enhances the chances of successful growth of seeds swept in on the tides , thereby recreating the same richly biodiverse eco-systems of old .
however , getting to the coastal regions in need of gentle cultivation is easier said than done .
talking of the difficulties in gaining access to land abandoned by shrimp farmers , enright said there are a lot of ownership hurdles to be cleared before restoration can begin .
but he and others like him are dedicated to the task in hand .
" on the whole people are doing the right thing , " spalding said .
" but mangroves are still declining too fast and we would be doing the world and ourselves a favor if we would just stop chopping down mangroves altogether . "

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 20.07.2010 broccoli and tomato patents under scrutiny at european patent office großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weapon in the fight against cancer : broccoli at the european patent office in munich , there are some tasty patents on the table for debate .
the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?

it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?

in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .

" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "

two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .

" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .

despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?

with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.07.2010 afghans skeptical about kabul conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many afghans wonder where all the aid money has gone the international afghanistan conference in kabul has ended with new plans and pledges for restructuring aid and trying to end militancy in the country .
afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .
good for a few , bad for the rest few locals are invited to work on the farms and with poor fishing yields , as a result of the decimation of their natural habitats , whole communities are suddenly unable to sustain themselves .
jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .
" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "
it is a lot to have to forego so that a handful of individuals can make a sack of cash , and it 's not even the whole picture .
weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dense foliage helps break the wind and water fall their tangled mass of roots , shoots and branches act as a buffer for fierce storms rolling in from the sea , and spalding even goes so far as to say that mangroves have what it takes to slow down the frightening process of rising sea levels .
" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .
tanzania has put all its mangroves under protection , and new trees and shrubs have been planted or encouraged to grow through measures such as waste removal in a range of other countries including australia , brazil , cuba , indonesia , philippines and thailand .

enright says this enhances the chances of successful growth of seeds swept in on the tides , thereby recreating the same richly biodiverse eco-systems of old .
however , getting to the coastal regions in need of gentle cultivation is easier said than done .
talking of the difficulties in gaining access to land abandoned by shrimp farmers , enright said there are a lot of ownership hurdles to be cleared before restoration can begin .

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "
wherever oil exploration takes place , companies and shareholders rake in profits while the local population is often left on its own to bear the environmental and social costs that arise .
and those costs , according to greenpeace 's cindy baxter , will be passed on from today 's generation to tomorrow 's .
" if you dig on any beach in prince william sound , you will find oil .
species and fisheries there have never recovered , " she said .
" prince william sound will never be what it was before the exxon valdez . " author : helle jeppesen -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

loew had put off renewing his contract until after the world cup in south africa . germany 's national soccer coach , joachim loew , has extended his contract until the european championship in 2012 in a move welcomed by many in the country 's football community .
" my team and i are very happy to continue working with the dfb -lrb- german football association -rrb- , " loew told a news conference in frankfurt .
" we are looking forward to the next challenges . " loew said he informed several national team players of his decision via cell phone text message . " there have already been some responses , from per mertesacker , miroslav klose and bastian schweinsteiger , " loew said .
" they wished me good luck and many thanks . "
the 50-year-old loew led an impressive young german team to a third-place finish at this year 's fifa world cup in south africa , after losing to eventual champions , spain , in the semi-final .
national manager oliver bierhoff and assistant coach hans-dieter flick have also extended their contracts until euro 2012 , which is to be staged in poland and ukraine .
the new deal comes after protracted contractual wrangling between the dfb and the national coaching team under loew and bierhoff .
talks broke down in february with the pair unhappy that details had been leaked to the media .
loew then said he would leave his decision until after the world cup .
football icons upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has backed loew 's new deal the reappointment has been broadly welcomed by the country 's football community , with former national team coach rudi voeller calling it a " very good decision by all involved .

voeller said maintaining the unity of the national coaching team , including flick and goalkeeping coach andreas koepke , was a positive development for german football .
" the fact that all four are staying is great , " he said .
" now the development of the last few years with the young , talented team can continue .
the basis for the future is there . "
senior national team member michael ballack , whose captaincy of die mannschaft has been under question after he was replaced by philipp lahm at the world cup , also praised loew 's re-appointment .
" i 'm happy the team will remain united .
it has performed excellently together , " said ballack , who returns to the bundesliga this season with his old club bayer leverkusen .
dfb president theo zwanziger , meanwhile , has left his own future open following loew 's contract extension .
the dfb executive committee is to due to deliberate over the presidency in october .
" -lsb- loew 's new deal -rsb- could have some influence , but it 's not vital , " zwanziger said in frankfurt .
" now , i 'm going to spend some time reflecting .
i will think calmly about what is right for the association and what is right for me . "
loew came to prominence as national assistance coach in the lead-up to the 2006 world cup in germany under then-head coach juergen klinsmann .
he assumed the top job when klinsmann stepped down following that tournament .

the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .
stuck in the cold war the left party is present on all political levels in germany , it has 76 deputies in the national parliament - and it argues the political establishment should rather deal with it in a political debate rather than via the intelligence service .
" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 20.07.2010 short-term jobs - a burden or an opportunity ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these days , short-term and freelance contracts are part and parcel of the labor market .
but what happens when your contract is over and is n't renewed ?
is working in the shadow of unemployment a burden ? or does it mean greater flexibility and opportunities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : william p. country : us short-term , or “ temporary ” jobs , as we would call them in the u.s. , are certainly a burden to the employee : first , they place undue stress on the individual because of the temporary or short-term character of the job .
there is no doubt that today ’ s job market suffers due to the lack of commitment to the job and the fact that the employee probably leaves the job at the end of the contract with nary a look back at the quality of his / her work . second , the conditions of employment must have an affect on the employee ’ s personal life , probably causing a reduction in commitment to family and other responsibilities .
these certainly include providing for personal and family health care , shelter and other essentials .
a short-term contract employee receives none of these benefits in the u. s. third , short-term employment creates an uncertainty in future job prospects for the entire economy .
on the employer ’ s side , i can see many advantages and opportunities ; typically , the lack of need for long-range provisions for the employee ’ s health and welfare .
this means that the cost of each employee is reduced by approximately 25 % .
better cash flow can mean better profits and greater business growth .
nor does the employer have to assure anything beyond the term of the contract for employment .
the employer can profit by the fact that a contract employee can often be considered a single cost of doing business , which allows for a different corporate or business income tax requirement . in my own business some years back , i had as many as thirteen individual contract employees , which served my business very well : i had no long-term responsibility to the employees for unemployment insurance , health insurance and other terms of employment under federal and state government .
so , you have employee shortcomings and employer opportunity .
overall , i am saddened by the loss of long-term , full-time employee loyalty to a company , which i feel gives a degree of quality to the product that is lacking with short-term employees .
after i sold my own business i worked for a firm for the next 27 years , and felt a long-lasting loyalty to that organization and its principals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mauricio y. country : canada in today 's job market , short term contract work must be seen as an opportunity to build up one 's network of potential permanent employers and not as a burden or as an endless cycle of employment and unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : yassine el .
y. · country : marocco i think short-term jobs are a good opportunity for young people to learn , to have more experience and to make some money .
for companies , those short-term jobs can be a way to find good employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india in times when having a job itself is a blessing , short-term jobs , far from being a burden , are like manna from heaven , not only for the employees , but also for the employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : carolina v. country : philippines especially in the philippines and some of the third-world countries it 's an opportunity , especially if you 're below middle-class , because it 's better to have a job than nothing .
it is important to have at least some regular earnings , in order to support yourself and your family ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : kazuo m. country : japan in the 1980s , japan was excited with " bubble prosperity " .
but when the recession covered on japan in 1990s , many youths had to choose short-term jobs .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

voeller said maintaining the unity of the national coaching team , including flick and goalkeeping coach andreas koepke , was a positive development for german football .
" the fact that all four are staying is great , " he said .
" now the development of the last few years with the young , talented team can continue .
the basis for the future is there . "
senior national team member michael ballack , whose captaincy of die mannschaft has been under question after he was replaced by philipp lahm at the world cup , also praised loew 's re-appointment .
" i 'm happy the team will remain united .
it has performed excellently together , " said ballack , who returns to the bundesliga this season with his old club bayer leverkusen .
dfb president theo zwanziger , meanwhile , has left his own future open following loew 's contract extension .
the dfb executive committee is to due to deliberate over the presidency in october .
" -lsb- loew 's new deal -rsb- could have some influence , but it 's not vital , " zwanziger said in frankfurt .
" now , i 'm going to spend some time reflecting .
i will think calmly about what is right for the association and what is right for me . "
loew came to prominence as national assistance coach in the lead-up to the 2006 world cup in germany under then-head coach juergen klinsmann .
he assumed the top job when klinsmann stepped down following that tournament .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.07.2010 paying for their messes : the record for oil companies is n't stellar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exxon valdez spilled more than 270,000 barrels of crude oil in prince william sound people affected by the exxon valdez oil-spill disaster had to wait two decades before being compensated .
it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "
wherever oil exploration takes place , companies and shareholders rake in profits while the local population is often left on its own to bear the environmental and social costs that arise .
and those costs , according to greenpeace 's cindy baxter , will be passed on from today 's generation to tomorrow 's .
" if you dig on any beach in prince william sound , you will find oil .
species and fisheries there have never recovered , " she said .

and those who expose police corruption live dangerously . two men in black threw petrol bombs at the head office of " tempo " magazine in jakarta earlier this month .
no one was hurt and no significant damage was done to the building . through its investigative journalism about corruption involving politicians , businessmen and the police , " tempo " magazine has made many powerful enemies in the past .
the june edition of the magazine featured a cover story with the title " the fat bank accounts of police officers " .
the cover depicts a policeman leading three pig-shaped money boxes on leashes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard walks outside the office of tempo magazine in jakarta intimidation attempts " we are not sure , but obviously either it is people who are unhappy with our investigations into alleged illegal payments to high ranking officers in the police force or people who want to stir trouble , " bambang harymurti , the ceo and chief editor of " tempo " , told deutsche welle about who might be behind the attack .
" it 's probably not from the police as an institution but rather from some police officers who are not very happy with our report .
i think they want to send a message not to mess with us or continue this kind of reporting .
this is an initial attempt to try to clamp down on press freedom . " two days after the attack on the magazine , an indonesian anti-graft activist was also attacked .
tama langkun from indonesia corruption watch was hit on the head as he rode back home on a motorcycle , apparently for speaking out against police corruption . these kinds of attacks remind indonesians of the autocratic suharto regime and raise questions about the strength of the country 's democracy .
bambang harymurti described the consequences : " i 'm sure it has an effect on our work .
at tempo , we make sure it will strengthen our resolve to fight corruption , but i 'm sure it has an effect on people .
it creates an environment of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is the third time in a row that the indonesian police has been rated as most corrupt rampant police corruption corruption is known to be worst amongst the police and the judiciary in indonesia .
according to transparency international indonesia , police have now topped the corruption list for the third time in a row .
more than half of all interactions with police are estimated to involve the payment of bribes . as bambang harymurti from " tempo " magazine explained , " recently because of the reform process , the military in indonesia have lost power and the police have gained a lot of power .
in indonesia the problem is that our entire corruption agency has to rely on the police .
therefore it is difficult for the corruption agency to investigate the police .
another reason that the police are corrupt is that they do not have enough money for their operations and police officers only have a meagre salary . " adnan topan husodo , vice- coordinator of indonesian corruption watch , added , " we know that in some areas , the government has introduced some progressive reforms within the police force as an institution .
but we know that the reform is not good enough .
there are still problems in the way the police function . " president susilo bambang yudhoyono has asked the police to investigate the latest attacks .
but in view of the nature of the problem it appears highly unlikely that this approach will lead to the culprits being caught . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 20.07.2010 tradition is key to success for europe 's oldest porcelain maker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crossed swords painted in blue form meissen 's emblem at 100,000 euros for a clock , buyers may wonder just what 's behind porcelain from meissen .
the meissen factory focuses on artisanship and tradition and hopes that this emphasis will help it beat economic woes . to mark its 300th anniversary this year , porcelain manufacturer meissen announced it would sell 10 special edition clocks at prices of 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 129,000 -rrb- each .
that might stun the average buyer , but the clocks sold out immediately - with an additional 30 orders placed that could not be filled .
" issuing 10 clocks was n't just a marketing trick or an arbitrary limited edition , " explained meissen 's ceo christian kurtzke .
" it reflects the number of clocks we 'll actually be able to finish in a year . "
that 's because meissen still relies on its traditional production methods as europe 's oldest porcelain maker .
the porcelain is crafted from scratch and painted entirely in-house by specialists who have trained for years at the factory in eastern germany .
the company 's emphasis on tradition may have helped save it from bankruptcy , despite the problems that have plagued the luxury industry following the global financial crisis .
other porcelain producers like wedgwood in england and subsidiary rosenthal in germany have declared bankruptcy in the last few years .
bildunterschrift : the chronos 300 , meissen 's anniversary clock , includes a series of motifs inspired by asian art 30 years experience required for ceo kurtzke , the clocks are works of art .
just five employees are authorized to craft the chronos 300 , and each employee has at least 30 to 40 years of experience designing porcelain .
they are part of a production process that has resisted globalization .
no step in the porcelain manufacture has been outsourced , and the artists employed at meissen are typically drawn from the region .
after an apprenticeship that lasts more than three years , an artist may be hired , typically specializing in a single motif , like flowers , birds or oriental patterns .
" the porcelain makers here are proud , not only because we work for the oldest porcelain manufacturer in europe , but it 's also an honor to have enough skill for the job , " said one artist who paints porcelain at meissen .
alchemy and ' white gold ' around 10,000 colors are available for the artists to use in painting .
each color is produced locally at laboratories in meissen - just like the porcelain itself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meissen artists combine numerous porcelain pieces to form intricate designs that 's a tradition that dates back 300 years to polish king augustus the strong .
fascinated by the porcelain imported from asia , he pressed an alchemist to discover the secret behind " white gold . "
within 10 years , they had succeeded , and the meissen factory was born in 1710 .
" this story of discovery and the characters involved make the background to the factory very interesting and the products themselves very innovative and unusual , " said rodney woolley , a porcelain expert at christie 's auction house in london .
" it also makes meissen one of the best known brands in the world . "
the company 's history and brand name recognition have contributed to some hefty auction prices in recent years , including the sale of two 16-inch meissen candelabras for 337,000 euros and two bird figurines for 169,000 euros last december in an auction hosted by christie 's in paris .
weathering the storm despite having weathered the economic crisis well with stable sales in 2009 and 30 percent sales growth so far in 2010 , meissen has faced financial problems in recent years .
in july , the company announced job cuts amounting to nearly a fourth of the current staff , and changes are being planned in the product lines and how they are marketed .
nevertheless , kurtzke is preserving the traditions at the core of the company .
the job cuts will be made among the administrative staff rather than among the artists , and the porcelain will continue to be crafted individually at meissen 's factory .
bildunterschrift : meissen 's " fuerstenzug " in dresden depicts nobility and other figures from saxony 's history though popularly associated with dishware or small sculptures , the company hopes to expand its appeal for upscale interior design pieces .
" we view our primary field as the entire home and the entire home interior , from floor to ceiling - and especially in the architectural arena , we see a lot of potential for growth , " kurtzke said .
architectural products may include porcelain tile to be used in bathroom floors or walls .
as a waterproof material , porcelain can even be used for wall mountings that must face the elements , like the famous fuerstenzug frieze on the outer wall of a dresden palace made from meissen 's porcelain .
but not everyone is convinced by the company 's innovations .
one guest at the factory 's year-long retrospective exhibition had a clear preference for the older pieces on display .
" the newer pieces are n't as pretty - and there are a few out there that i would n't buy even if i were a millionaire ! " she said .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "

die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a uniquely long-standing relationship with afghanistan leading talks with taliban ?
die welt newspaper , popular among conservative intellectuals , published a commentary by pakistani journalist and taliban expert ahmed rashid , who wrote that " germany should take the lead in opening dialog with the taliban , as it is one of the few european powers that enjoys the trust of all afghans . "
in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s . "
no plans to conduct negotiations with the taliban have been seriously discussed in diplomatic circles .

the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .
stuck in the cold war the left party is present on all political levels in germany , it has 76 deputies in the national parliament - and it argues the political establishment should rather deal with it in a political debate rather than via the intelligence service .
" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "
no unified plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media say germany must concentrate on building social order the development policy spokesman for the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary faction , holger haibach , stressed that the afghan government needed to commit to the fulfillment of " clear goals for reconstruction , that it intends to reach with international support , " adding that this aid would " need to continue for a long time , even after the withdrawal of international troops . " meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .
afghanistan needs a government " that wo n't vanish into oblivion . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 20.07.2010 despite rumors of its demise , the us-uk special relationship is alive , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before they became leaders of their countries , david cameron met barack obama in london david cameron has repeatedly called for a british foreign policy that is more independent from the us .
but during his first official white house trip , expect both leaders to stress the special bond between their nations . when the leader of britain 's conservative party , david cameron , in a 2006 speech in washington , criticised his country 's " slavish " relationship with the us , he ruffled some feathers .
baroness thatcher , the former prime minister and conservative icon , who happened to be in the us at the time as well , issued a rebuke through the white house , reiterating that britain stood by the us " in the front line against islamist fanatics who hate our beliefs , our liberties and our citizens . "
four years later , david cameron has moved into number 10 downing street and on tuesday will visit president barack obama for the first time officially in the white house .
and while prime minister cameron has n't repeated the word slavish to characterize the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states , just before leaving for the us he reiterated the inequality of the british-american relationship : " we should always be conscious of the fact that we 're the junior partner in this relationship and america is a pacific power as well as an atlantic power . "
cooler approach instead of focusing too much on the us , cameron wants to develop deeper ties with other countries ; for example , he wants to forge a new special relationship with india .
washington for its part has reacted coolly to cameron 's verbal recalibration of transatlantic ties .
barack obama , unlike many of his predecessors , is considered to have no special fondness towards britain , and according to media reports was rather put off by former prime minister gordon brown 's continued efforts to score ' face time ' with him .
in any case , obama is dealing with so many pressing issues , that the nature of the relationship with britain probably does n't rank very high on his priority list .
but while cameron and obama try to play down its importance , the so-called special relationship is , in fact , alive and well . " the special relationship is a funny term , " says klaus larres , an expert on british and us foreign policy , currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies -lrb- sais -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington .
" every prime minister and every president confirms that this special relationship does exist , but at the same time the media usually say that there is no special relationship left . "
larres contends that there is indeed something like a special relationship between britain and the united states that is independent of the leaders currently in power .
security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron criticised the relationship tony blair developed with george w. bush " and that usually refers to the defense cooperation , particularly to intelligence cooperation " , says larres .
" one really has to say that the exchange and information about intelligence between the two countries is probably as close as with no other country .
so in that respect the special relationship does exist . "
michael williams , an expert in transatlantic relations at royal holloway college , university of london , agrees : " the special relationship as it relates to the close political , military and intelligence cooperation between the uk and the us is undoubtedly just as strong under obama and cameron as it was under thatcher and reagan . "
for williams , cameron 's remarks about not being ' slavish ' to the us and the importance of developing closer ties with other nations " were largely political pandering " .
of course , london needs to built stronger ties with other countries , he adds .
" but to believe for example that the uk and india can develop the same sort of closeness in their relationship as the us and the uk is a bit of a stretch . "
so while the special relationship is real , it should n't be mistaken for a blissful consensus on global issues .
in fact there are often quite serious differences between london and washington on major topics .
and those differences could even increase in the future , says larres .
" there are policy areas where both men have to differ because their countries have to take different positions in the world . "
anglo-american tiff the most recent rift between the white house and downing street was over bp , played out in public and which , depending on developments in the gulf of mexico , may even continue .
bildunterschrift : the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico has caused some tensions between the us and the uk " cameron was seriously annoyed when obama for example did not refer to bp in one press remark " , says larres , " but used the old term british petroleum , which of course clearly puts the ball in the court of the british and the responsibility for the whole mess not just in the court of the company , but on britain as a country . "
there are other issues for potential future clashes between the us and the uk .
one could be britain 's strong austerity measures which washington views as counterproductive .
another could be afghanistan where the us urgently needs a war-weary britain to stay on as its most important ally .
but despite some possible disagreements and efforts to rebalance and modernize their transatlantic ties , the experts do n't expect david cameron and barack obama to discard the special relationship anytime soon because it simply is n't in their interest .
so somewhere in their communique , after the president and the prime minister 's three hour meeting on tuesday , we can be sure to find the phrase ' special relationship ' once again .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .

the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .

ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 20.07.2010 germany remembers stauffenberg on execution anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several hundred dignitaries attended tuesday 's ceremony the commemoration ceremony for claus schenk graf von stauffenberg and his co-conspirators took place at the site of his execution , the bendlerblock , on tuesday .
the bendlerblock is now the german defense ministry . july 20 marks the 66th anniversary of the execution of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , the german army officer and leader of a resistance movement that very nearly assassinated adolf hitler in 1944 .
the large number of politicians , senior military officers , reporters , and representatives of various memorial organizations present at tuesday 's ceremony are a testament to the importance germany still attaches to the resistance movement that crystallized around stauffenberg during world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauffenberg 's actions shaped the principles of the post-war german army the resistance hero was executed along with four of his co-conspirators in the courtyard of the bendlerblock building , and the first commemoration took place here in 1952 , under the supervision of ernst reuter , berlin 's first post-war mayor .
reuter 's central message that day – that the failure of stauffenberg 's plot did not mar its moral importance for germans after the war – was taken up by the current mayor , klaus wowereit , as his own guiding theme . "
' their work was not in vain ' - ernst reuter 's sentence has become the motto of this commemoration in the past 58 years , " wowereit said in his speech .
" by their actions , the women and men of the resistance set ethical benchmarks , and so became role models . "
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg echoed the mayor 's sentiments , and spoke of the emotional intensity with which the resistance movement 's actions still resonate directly today .
" they show us living today that even in the darkest days of dictatorship , there was another , a better germany , " he said .
the mutiny that defined the german army but the most impressive speech was delivered by the venerable us historian fritz stern , who spoke of the vital legacy that the resistance bequeathed to the german army .
" the idea of a citizen in uniform is the role model of the german army , " he said .
" the warning that even a soldier must follow his conscience – to the point of disobedience – is the legacy of the resistance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us historian fritz stern delivered a thought-provoking speech drawing comparisons with the french resistance , stern also spoke of the new , wider perspective with which the german resistance movement is being regarded in europe , and quoted former french europe minister noelle lenoir , who honored one of stauffenberg 's surviving co-conspirators - philipp von boeselager - in 2004 with generous words .
" with their blood , they wrote one of the most heroic and horrifying pages of german history , " lenoir had said , " their sacrifice did not spare germany , but it saved germany 's honor . "
stern called this , " a striking tribute ! "
after his speech , the military band and the laying of wreaths , stern warned that the commemoration of resistance fighters should not be reinterpreted for modern political purposes .
" it should never be , as the saying goes , instrumentalized , " he told deutsche welle .
" it should n't be manipulated .
people should know about it , recognize it and honor it .
period . "

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .

the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .
stuck in the cold war the left party is present on all political levels in germany , it has 76 deputies in the national parliament - and it argues the political establishment should rather deal with it in a political debate rather than via the intelligence service .
" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 20.07.2010 despite rumors of its demise , the us-uk special relationship is alive , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before they became leaders of their countries , david cameron met barack obama in london david cameron has repeatedly called for a british foreign policy that is more independent from the us .
but during his first official white house trip , expect both leaders to stress the special bond between their nations . when the leader of britain 's conservative party , david cameron , in a 2006 speech in washington , criticised his country 's " slavish " relationship with the us , he ruffled some feathers .
baroness thatcher , the former prime minister and conservative icon , who happened to be in the us at the time as well , issued a rebuke through the white house , reiterating that britain stood by the us " in the front line against islamist fanatics who hate our beliefs , our liberties and our citizens . "
four years later , david cameron has moved into number 10 downing street and on tuesday will visit president barack obama for the first time officially in the white house .
and while prime minister cameron has n't repeated the word slavish to characterize the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states , just before leaving for the us he reiterated the inequality of the british-american relationship : " we should always be conscious of the fact that we 're the junior partner in this relationship and america is a pacific power as well as an atlantic power . "
cooler approach instead of focusing too much on the us , cameron wants to develop deeper ties with other countries ; for example , he wants to forge a new special relationship with india .
washington for its part has reacted coolly to cameron 's verbal recalibration of transatlantic ties .
barack obama , unlike many of his predecessors , is considered to have no special fondness towards britain , and according to media reports was rather put off by former prime minister gordon brown 's continued efforts to score ' face time ' with him .
in any case , obama is dealing with so many pressing issues , that the nature of the relationship with britain probably does n't rank very high on his priority list .
but while cameron and obama try to play down its importance , the so-called special relationship is , in fact , alive and well . " the special relationship is a funny term , " says klaus larres , an expert on british and us foreign policy , currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies -lrb- sais -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington .
" every prime minister and every president confirms that this special relationship does exist , but at the same time the media usually say that there is no special relationship left . "
larres contends that there is indeed something like a special relationship between britain and the united states that is independent of the leaders currently in power .
security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron criticised the relationship tony blair developed with george w. bush " and that usually refers to the defense cooperation , particularly to intelligence cooperation " , says larres .
" one really has to say that the exchange and information about intelligence between the two countries is probably as close as with no other country .
so in that respect the special relationship does exist . "
michael williams , an expert in transatlantic relations at royal holloway college , university of london , agrees : " the special relationship as it relates to the close political , military and intelligence cooperation between the uk and the us is undoubtedly just as strong under obama and cameron as it was under thatcher and reagan . "
for williams , cameron 's remarks about not being ' slavish ' to the us and the importance of developing closer ties with other nations " were largely political pandering " .
of course , london needs to built stronger ties with other countries , he adds .
" but to believe for example that the uk and india can develop the same sort of closeness in their relationship as the us and the uk is a bit of a stretch . "
so while the special relationship is real , it should n't be mistaken for a blissful consensus on global issues .
in fact there are often quite serious differences between london and washington on major topics .
and those differences could even increase in the future , says larres .
" there are policy areas where both men have to differ because their countries have to take different positions in the world . "
anglo-american tiff the most recent rift between the white house and downing street was over bp , played out in public and which , depending on developments in the gulf of mexico , may even continue .
bildunterschrift : the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico has caused some tensions between the us and the uk " cameron was seriously annoyed when obama for example did not refer to bp in one press remark " , says larres , " but used the old term british petroleum , which of course clearly puts the ball in the court of the british and the responsibility for the whole mess not just in the court of the company , but on britain as a country . "
there are other issues for potential future clashes between the us and the uk .
one could be britain 's strong austerity measures which washington views as counterproductive .
another could be afghanistan where the us urgently needs a war-weary britain to stay on as its most important ally .
but despite some possible disagreements and efforts to rebalance and modernize their transatlantic ties , the experts do n't expect david cameron and barack obama to discard the special relationship anytime soon because it simply is n't in their interest .
so somewhere in their communique , after the president and the prime minister 's three hour meeting on tuesday , we can be sure to find the phrase ' special relationship ' once again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.07.2010 migrant workers prop up balkan economies from abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matic 's airplane assembly plant is based in kraljevo , serbia in times of economic crisis , poor nations depend more than ever on money transfers from migrant workers in the west .
in the balkans , summer brings a new wave of cash . a sport aircraft painted in the serb national colors - white , blue and red - speeds over the bumpy grass runway , climbs into the air and performs a short set of air acrobatics , before coming in for a smooth landing .
out steps milorad matic . the 37-year-old not only owns the plane , but also the firm aero-east-europe , an airplane manufacturer he founded three years ago in the city of kraljevo , serbia . twenty years ago , matic left his country in hopes of making a living in the west .
he worked on construction sites in northern italy , and later founded his own construction company in germany .
he also fulfilled a childhood dream and took flying lessons .
with money earned in italy and germany , and know-how from italy and the czech republic , he then returned to serbia .
today , he employs 25 mechanics and engineers .
a patriotic duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government encourages investment in serbia if you live abroad , matic says , you feel much more patriotic .
" if you are here , you do n't miss your country .
but if you 're not , you feel drawn back to it , and you feel this patriotic pain , " he said . the businessman says he invested in serbia out of love for his native country .
he supported his family and friends long before that , when he still lived in the west - as many serbs who work in italy , germany , austria or switzerland do , matic says .
" they send money .
without these transfers , many families could not even survive .
or you bring money in .
or you try to build up something , " he said .
newly constructed buildings have sprung up across the balkans , houses for the entire extended family , built with the money migrants regularly send home .
important social net " we believe that most of the money goes to the poorest families , " said marco mantovaneli , head of the world bank 's bosnian bureau in sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mantovaneli says migrant workers create a social security net " by supporting the family members who stayed behind , migrant workers take on the important role of a social security net , " he said . international experts estimate that in bosnia and herzegovina , such bank transfers account for more than 15 percent of the gross domestic product - more than $ 2.5 billion -lrb- 1.93 billion euros -rrb- last year alone . vendors selling their goods at sarajevo 's central market profit , too .
nerima sells flowers here , and is lucky that her cousins emigrated to the united states years ago .
several times a year , they send her a few hundred us dollars .
nerima says they ca n't send more ; they have to pay off a loan .
" i hope they can send more when they are better off so that we can survive , " she said .
" selling flowers , sometimes we do n't even make enough to buy dinner . "
fewer money transfers due to the financial crisis a man at a neraby vegetable stand is also dissatisfied .
his brothers and sisters in germany have become more tightfisted because of the economic crisis .
" they say they are doing worse than we are because they do n't have work , " he said .
" sometimes they help a little bit , and send 10 euros or so . "
last year , the world bank warned that the poor could be hardest hit by the global financial crisis and its effects ; the economic and social structures of many nations could break down without the money transfers from migrant workers . last year , these transfers did in fact drop by about 20 percent .
in bosnia , transfers dropped by about half a billion dollars from 2008 .
serbia , though , was not hit quite as hard .
since 2004 , the world bank estimates that migrant workers have pumped about $ 30 billion into that country .
send us money , but do n't come home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : selling vegetables and flowers is not profitable enough returnees who invest in their country often encounter corruption and mismanagement .
firms often go broke because of local problems , says airplane constructor matic .
" you invest everything you 've saved , and it 's your downfall , " he said , adding that corruption and mismanagement have cost him one million euros .
the migrants tread a fine line between what their heart and what common sense dictates .
in the balkans , their financial support is urgently needed .
which means that the migrants themselves are expected to stay in the west so they can continue to pay .
matic , too , has mixed feelings .
he returned home , but has experienced a hard landing in his beloved native country . he only sells his planes on the international market .
" it was a mistake to come back , " he said . " my heart tells me it was right because this is where my family is .
businesswise , it was a mistake - i 'd have led a better life in a different country . "

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .

a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .
at least 17 people died and ten thousand are still suffering health problems as a result .
the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the niger delta has the largest concentration of gas flares in the world while london-based oil trader trafigura , one of the world 's biggest private oil companies , did not admit guilt in the matter , it did come to an agreement with the government in abidjan , paying a lump sum of $ 150 million for clean-up and disposal efforts .
those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .
those living in the slums of akuedo in abidjan , however , have to continue living with the contamination ; the toxic waste has still not been cleaned up .
delta disaster in nigeria 's niger delta , where oil giant royal dutch shell is active , a similar story has played out .
for half a century , the region has been exploited by foreign companies looking for easy-to-refine oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts work to remove toxic waste at a site near akuedo village , ivory coast according to estimates by environmentalists , over that time some two billion liters of oil have spilled into the delta , which corresponds roughly to about one accident of " exxon valdez " proportions per year .
the black crude has contaminated the marshes , mangrove swamps and waterways of the delta , an area about the size of portugal .
" i am from the niger delta : i grew up in the creeks .
i am not a stranger to oil spills and their devastating effects , " said ankio briggs , an environmental activist .
" since 40 years we 've been experiencing spills , gas flaring and all that . "
wherever oil exploration takes place , companies and shareholders rake in profits while the local population is often left on its own to bear the environmental and social costs that arise .
and those costs , according to greenpeace 's cindy baxter , will be passed on from today 's generation to tomorrow 's .
" if you dig on any beach in prince william sound , you will find oil .
species and fisheries there have never recovered , " she said .
" prince william sound will never be what it was before the exxon valdez . " author : helle jeppesen -lrb- jam -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 20.07.2010 despite rumors of its demise , the us-uk special relationship is alive , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before they became leaders of their countries , david cameron met barack obama in london david cameron has repeatedly called for a british foreign policy that is more independent from the us .
but during his first official white house trip , expect both leaders to stress the special bond between their nations . when the leader of britain 's conservative party , david cameron , in a 2006 speech in washington , criticised his country 's " slavish " relationship with the us , he ruffled some feathers .
baroness thatcher , the former prime minister and conservative icon , who happened to be in the us at the time as well , issued a rebuke through the white house , reiterating that britain stood by the us " in the front line against islamist fanatics who hate our beliefs , our liberties and our citizens . "
four years later , david cameron has moved into number 10 downing street and on tuesday will visit president barack obama for the first time officially in the white house .
and while prime minister cameron has n't repeated the word slavish to characterize the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states , just before leaving for the us he reiterated the inequality of the british-american relationship : " we should always be conscious of the fact that we 're the junior partner in this relationship and america is a pacific power as well as an atlantic power . "
cooler approach instead of focusing too much on the us , cameron wants to develop deeper ties with other countries ; for example , he wants to forge a new special relationship with india .
washington for its part has reacted coolly to cameron 's verbal recalibration of transatlantic ties .
barack obama , unlike many of his predecessors , is considered to have no special fondness towards britain , and according to media reports was rather put off by former prime minister gordon brown 's continued efforts to score ' face time ' with him .
in any case , obama is dealing with so many pressing issues , that the nature of the relationship with britain probably does n't rank very high on his priority list .
but while cameron and obama try to play down its importance , the so-called special relationship is , in fact , alive and well . " the special relationship is a funny term , " says klaus larres , an expert on british and us foreign policy , currently a visiting professor at the school of advanced international studies -lrb- sais -rrb- at johns hopkins university in washington .
" every prime minister and every president confirms that this special relationship does exist , but at the same time the media usually say that there is no special relationship left . "
larres contends that there is indeed something like a special relationship between britain and the united states that is independent of the leaders currently in power .
security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron criticised the relationship tony blair developed with george w. bush " and that usually refers to the defense cooperation , particularly to intelligence cooperation " , says larres .
" one really has to say that the exchange and information about intelligence between the two countries is probably as close as with no other country .
so in that respect the special relationship does exist . "
michael williams , an expert in transatlantic relations at royal holloway college , university of london , agrees : " the special relationship as it relates to the close political , military and intelligence cooperation between the uk and the us is undoubtedly just as strong under obama and cameron as it was under thatcher and reagan . "
for williams , cameron 's remarks about not being ' slavish ' to the us and the importance of developing closer ties with other nations " were largely political pandering " .
of course , london needs to built stronger ties with other countries , he adds .
" but to believe for example that the uk and india can develop the same sort of closeness in their relationship as the us and the uk is a bit of a stretch . "
so while the special relationship is real , it should n't be mistaken for a blissful consensus on global issues .
in fact there are often quite serious differences between london and washington on major topics .
and those differences could even increase in the future , says larres .
" there are policy areas where both men have to differ because their countries have to take different positions in the world . "
anglo-american tiff the most recent rift between the white house and downing street was over bp , played out in public and which , depending on developments in the gulf of mexico , may even continue .
bildunterschrift : the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico has caused some tensions between the us and the uk " cameron was seriously annoyed when obama for example did not refer to bp in one press remark " , says larres , " but used the old term british petroleum , which of course clearly puts the ball in the court of the british and the responsibility for the whole mess not just in the court of the company , but on britain as a country . "
there are other issues for potential future clashes between the us and the uk .
one could be britain 's strong austerity measures which washington views as counterproductive .
another could be afghanistan where the us urgently needs a war-weary britain to stay on as its most important ally .
but despite some possible disagreements and efforts to rebalance and modernize their transatlantic ties , the experts do n't expect david cameron and barack obama to discard the special relationship anytime soon because it simply is n't in their interest .
so somewhere in their communique , after the president and the prime minister 's three hour meeting on tuesday , we can be sure to find the phrase ' special relationship ' once again .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .
our goal is to have a country that can ensure adequate security , and from which no terror threat can emerge - either against it or us , " he added .
yet he warned that the occupying nations " can not be successful without a political solution that accounts for all groups in the country . "

" meanwhile , former foreign minister and current social democrat leader in parliament , frank-walter steinmeier , accused chancellor angela merkel 's government of having no unified plan in its afghanistan mission .
in an interview with the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on sunday , he said westerwelle and defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had no agreement on a policy for afghanistan .
for weeks , he said , the foreign office had allowed the ministry of defense to take the lead - a " fatal " error , as progress in afghanistan , he said , must not be made only on a military basis .
german press calls for stronger dialog and democracy german press agreed that germany 's role in creating democracy and dialog in afghanistan was crucial .
the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , which also stressed that " more foreign soldiers died in afghanistan in june than ever before , " wrote that politicians should understand that " the people in kabul , kunduz and kandahar are not interested in so-called benchmarks or political goals that fill flowery documents , or in nice words from clintons , karzais or westerwelles . "
" they want to feel the progress in their daily lives , " the paper concluded .

in order to improve the situation in afghanistan , rashid wrote that germany must cease bowing down to american directives , explaining that the " american principle , that the taliban must be crushed by military action before negotiations , must be done away with . " germany , he said , was in a particularly strong position to lead talks with the taliban , being the " only large european power that has cultivated a close relationship with afghanistan since the 1920s .

german press say germany must lead the creation of democracy and dialog . germany 's foreign minister guido westerwelle is hopeful that germany can make headway at a groundbreaking kabul conference set to begin tuesday .
despite criticism that the german government has not united its plans for its afghan mission , westerwelle remained confident on monday that germany could continue improving security in afghanistan - and remove its troops by 2014 .
the process would take place in steps , beginning in the country 's most stable regions .
" it would be a major achievement if we could record that timetable in the conclusion document to the kabul conference , " westerwelle said , speaking to reporters in berlin .
" of course we know that we wo n't have european standards in afghanistan .

" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .

and those who expose police corruption live dangerously . two men in black threw petrol bombs at the head office of " tempo " magazine in jakarta earlier this month .
no one was hurt and no significant damage was done to the building . through its investigative journalism about corruption involving politicians , businessmen and the police , " tempo " magazine has made many powerful enemies in the past .
the june edition of the magazine featured a cover story with the title " the fat bank accounts of police officers " .
the cover depicts a policeman leading three pig-shaped money boxes on leashes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard walks outside the office of tempo magazine in jakarta intimidation attempts " we are not sure , but obviously either it is people who are unhappy with our investigations into alleged illegal payments to high ranking officers in the police force or people who want to stir trouble , " bambang harymurti , the ceo and chief editor of " tempo " , told deutsche welle about who might be behind the attack .
" it 's probably not from the police as an institution but rather from some police officers who are not very happy with our report .
i think they want to send a message not to mess with us or continue this kind of reporting .
this is an initial attempt to try to clamp down on press freedom . " two days after the attack on the magazine , an indonesian anti-graft activist was also attacked .
tama langkun from indonesia corruption watch was hit on the head as he rode back home on a motorcycle , apparently for speaking out against police corruption . these kinds of attacks remind indonesians of the autocratic suharto regime and raise questions about the strength of the country 's democracy .
bambang harymurti described the consequences : " i 'm sure it has an effect on our work .
at tempo , we make sure it will strengthen our resolve to fight corruption , but i 'm sure it has an effect on people .
it creates an environment of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is the third time in a row that the indonesian police has been rated as most corrupt rampant police corruption corruption is known to be worst amongst the police and the judiciary in indonesia .
according to transparency international indonesia , police have now topped the corruption list for the third time in a row .
more than half of all interactions with police are estimated to involve the payment of bribes . as bambang harymurti from " tempo " magazine explained , " recently because of the reform process , the military in indonesia have lost power and the police have gained a lot of power .
in indonesia the problem is that our entire corruption agency has to rely on the police .
therefore it is difficult for the corruption agency to investigate the police .
another reason that the police are corrupt is that they do not have enough money for their operations and police officers only have a meagre salary . " adnan topan husodo , vice- coordinator of indonesian corruption watch , added , " we know that in some areas , the government has introduced some progressive reforms within the police force as an institution .
but we know that the reform is not good enough .
there are still problems in the way the police function . " president susilo bambang yudhoyono has asked the police to investigate the latest attacks .
but in view of the nature of the problem it appears highly unlikely that this approach will lead to the culprits being caught . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the indonesian police face charges of torture indonesia 's national police force has marked its 63rd anniversary .
in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .
last week , london-based rights group amnesty international accused the indonesian police force of torturing detainees .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "

in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .

" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "

given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "

" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.07.2010 germany 's left party fights against surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is struggling to shed its far-left past germany 's left party has for long been under surveillance for alleged extremist tendencies .
the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .

the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .

" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ?
new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

loew had put off renewing his contract until after the world cup in south africa . germany 's national soccer coach , joachim loew , has extended his contract until the european championship in 2012 in a move welcomed by many in the country 's football community .

" they wished me good luck and many thanks . "
the 50-year-old loew led an impressive young german team to a third-place finish at this year 's fifa world cup in south africa , after losing to eventual champions , spain , in the semi-final .
national manager oliver bierhoff and assistant coach hans-dieter flick have also extended their contracts until euro 2012 , which is to be staged in poland and ukraine .
the new deal comes after protracted contractual wrangling between the dfb and the national coaching team under loew and bierhoff .
talks broke down in february with the pair unhappy that details had been leaked to the media .
loew then said he would leave his decision until after the world cup .

" the fact that all four are staying is great , " he said .
" now the development of the last few years with the young , talented team can continue .
the basis for the future is there . "
senior national team member michael ballack , whose captaincy of die mannschaft has been under question after he was replaced by philipp lahm at the world cup , also praised loew 's re-appointment .
" i 'm happy the team will remain united .
it has performed excellently together , " said ballack , who returns to the bundesliga this season with his old club bayer leverkusen .
dfb president theo zwanziger , meanwhile , has left his own future open following loew 's contract extension .
the dfb executive committee is to due to deliberate over the presidency in october .
" -lsb- loew 's new deal -rsb- could have some influence , but it 's not vital , " zwanziger said in frankfurt .
" now , i 'm going to spend some time reflecting .
i will think calmly about what is right for the association and what is right for me . "
loew came to prominence as national assistance coach in the lead-up to the 2006 world cup in germany under then-head coach juergen klinsmann .
he assumed the top job when klinsmann stepped down following that tournament .

and those who expose police corruption live dangerously . two men in black threw petrol bombs at the head office of " tempo " magazine in jakarta earlier this month .
no one was hurt and no significant damage was done to the building . through its investigative journalism about corruption involving politicians , businessmen and the police , " tempo " magazine has made many powerful enemies in the past .
the june edition of the magazine featured a cover story with the title " the fat bank accounts of police officers " .
the cover depicts a policeman leading three pig-shaped money boxes on leashes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard walks outside the office of tempo magazine in jakarta intimidation attempts " we are not sure , but obviously either it is people who are unhappy with our investigations into alleged illegal payments to high ranking officers in the police force or people who want to stir trouble , " bambang harymurti , the ceo and chief editor of " tempo " , told deutsche welle about who might be behind the attack .
" it 's probably not from the police as an institution but rather from some police officers who are not very happy with our report .
i think they want to send a message not to mess with us or continue this kind of reporting .
this is an initial attempt to try to clamp down on press freedom . " two days after the attack on the magazine , an indonesian anti-graft activist was also attacked .
tama langkun from indonesia corruption watch was hit on the head as he rode back home on a motorcycle , apparently for speaking out against police corruption . these kinds of attacks remind indonesians of the autocratic suharto regime and raise questions about the strength of the country 's democracy .
bambang harymurti described the consequences : " i 'm sure it has an effect on our work .
at tempo , we make sure it will strengthen our resolve to fight corruption , but i 'm sure it has an effect on people .
it creates an environment of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is the third time in a row that the indonesian police has been rated as most corrupt rampant police corruption corruption is known to be worst amongst the police and the judiciary in indonesia .
according to transparency international indonesia , police have now topped the corruption list for the third time in a row .
more than half of all interactions with police are estimated to involve the payment of bribes . as bambang harymurti from " tempo " magazine explained , " recently because of the reform process , the military in indonesia have lost power and the police have gained a lot of power .
in indonesia the problem is that our entire corruption agency has to rely on the police .
therefore it is difficult for the corruption agency to investigate the police .
another reason that the police are corrupt is that they do not have enough money for their operations and police officers only have a meagre salary . " adnan topan husodo , vice- coordinator of indonesian corruption watch , added , " we know that in some areas , the government has introduced some progressive reforms within the police force as an institution .
but we know that the reform is not good enough .
there are still problems in the way the police function . " president susilo bambang yudhoyono has asked the police to investigate the latest attacks .
but in view of the nature of the problem it appears highly unlikely that this approach will lead to the culprits being caught . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the indonesian police face charges of torture indonesia 's national police force has marked its 63rd anniversary .
in a speech at the formal ceremony in jakarta on wednesday , president susilo bambang yudhoyono praised the police 's performance but fell short of mentioning anything related to recent concerns raised by rights groups over alleged abuses by the police .

censorship and the shutting down of newspapers have become a thing of the past and a 1999 press law was a great milestone for the young democracy .
however , the increasing influence of media moguls are posing new challenges .

the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : the fight against hiv / aids successful in past , german aids research faces uncertain future aids experts urge rich countries not to renege on funding promises liberal drug laws- is the czech republic the amsterdam of the east ?
new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

but what happens when your contract is over and is n't renewed ?
is working in the shadow of unemployment a burden ? or does it mean greater flexibility and opportunities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : william p. country : us short-term , or “ temporary ” jobs , as we would call them in the u.s. , are certainly a burden to the employee : first , they place undue stress on the individual because of the temporary or short-term character of the job .
there is no doubt that today ’ s job market suffers due to the lack of commitment to the job and the fact that the employee probably leaves the job at the end of the contract with nary a look back at the quality of his / her work . second , the conditions of employment must have an affect on the employee ’ s personal life , probably causing a reduction in commitment to family and other responsibilities .
these certainly include providing for personal and family health care , shelter and other essentials .
a short-term contract employee receives none of these benefits in the u. s. third , short-term employment creates an uncertainty in future job prospects for the entire economy .
on the employer ’ s side , i can see many advantages and opportunities ; typically , the lack of need for long-range provisions for the employee ’ s health and welfare .
this means that the cost of each employee is reduced by approximately 25 % .
better cash flow can mean better profits and greater business growth .
nor does the employer have to assure anything beyond the term of the contract for employment .
the employer can profit by the fact that a contract employee can often be considered a single cost of doing business , which allows for a different corporate or business income tax requirement . in my own business some years back , i had as many as thirteen individual contract employees , which served my business very well : i had no long-term responsibility to the employees for unemployment insurance , health insurance and other terms of employment under federal and state government .
so , you have employee shortcomings and employer opportunity .
overall , i am saddened by the loss of long-term , full-time employee loyalty to a company , which i feel gives a degree of quality to the product that is lacking with short-term employees .
after i sold my own business i worked for a firm for the next 27 years , and felt a long-lasting loyalty to that organization and its principals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : mauricio y. country : canada in today 's job market , short term contract work must be seen as an opportunity to build up one 's network of potential permanent employers and not as a burden or as an endless cycle of employment and unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : yassine el .
y. · country : marocco i think short-term jobs are a good opportunity for young people to learn , to have more experience and to make some money .
for companies , those short-term jobs can be a way to find good employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india in times when having a job itself is a blessing , short-term jobs , far from being a burden , are like manna from heaven , not only for the employees , but also for the employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : carolina v. country : philippines especially in the philippines and some of the third-world countries it 's an opportunity , especially if you 're below middle-class , because it 's better to have a job than nothing .
it is important to have at least some regular earnings , in order to support yourself and your family ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : kazuo m. country : japan in the 1980s , japan was excited with " bubble prosperity " .
but when the recession covered on japan in 1990s , many youths had to choose short-term jobs .
and today , they are losing their jobs because of getting old .
in the 1980s , they said that the labor market should accept changing jobs like in the u.s. but the expect has failed and labors are getting to easily to be fired like in the u.s. it is the result .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.07.2010 germany 's left party fights against surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is struggling to shed its far-left past germany 's left party has for long been under surveillance for alleged extremist tendencies .
the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 20.07.2010 secrecy surrounds kafka manuscripts amid ownership row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author franz kafka causes controversy even after his death the fate of franz kafka 's literary heritage has turned into a legal tussle .
boxes presumably containing some of his manuscripts were opened this week - the contents , however , remain a secret . original manuscripts belonging to german-speaking jewish author franz kafka were extracted monday from the vault of swiss bank ubs . four safes which held manuscripts and drawings for over 50 years were opened in zurich , international newspapers reported .
among the documents is presumed to be a well-known short story by kafka , written in his own hand - and thus worth a fortune . the exact contents , however , remain unknown as the parties involved refuse to comment ..
the documents are at the heart of a legal battle which spans a century and includes a dead poet , his friend , a secretary and her daughters , and the state of israel . for the past two years , the case has been disputed in a tel aviv courtroom .
it 's not the literature but money that has two elderly sisters battling with the state of israel over ownership of the kafka manuscripts .
the two sisters were bequeathed the papers by their mother , kafka 's secretary , while the national library of israel regards kafka 's manuscripts as part of the nation 's cultural heritage . as if taken from his books bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max brod disobeyed kafka 's last request the story of kafka 's legacy is one of labyrinthine complexities , absurdities and struggles that could just as well constitute one of kafka 's own novels .
the first chapter begins with kafka 's letter to his friend max brod , two sentences on an ink-blotted piece of paper : " dearest max , my last request : everything i leave behind me … in the way of diaries , manuscripts , letters , my own and others ’ , sketches and so on is to be burned completely and unread , the same applies to everything drawn or written which you or others , who you should ask for it , possess . … .
yours , franz kafka " brod disobeyed .
instead of burning everything , he kept the documents and smuggled them from prague to tel aviv on the eve of the nazi invasion of czechoslovakia in 1939 .
later , brod gave the papers as a present to his former secretary esther hoffe , who herself handed them to her daughters , eva hoffe and ruth wiesler , prior to her death . part of jewish cultural heritage the hoffe sisters , both over 70 now , found themselves in an israeli court room just as they decided to sell all the documents to the german literature archive in marbach .
meir heller , lawyer for israel 's national library , said the zurich manuscripts amount to a national cultural treasure for israel . " the documents have to be made accessible to the public in israel , " he said .
heller insisted that israel was the rightful home of the works of all great jewish scholars . " a jewish author , writing in german , born in prague - which country would you assign kafka to ? " said professor manfred engel , a kafka expert at saarland university .
" it 's not easy , but to me , marbach seems to be the better place to store the documents . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original script of " the trial " is kept in a bunker under the literature archive apart from oxford , marbach owns the largest collection of kafka manuscripts worldwide , including the manuscript of his grandiose but disturbing novel " the trial , " which was bought at a sotheby ’ s auction for 3.5 million german marks in 1988 . " from a scientist 's point of view , it 's best to keep all the documents in one place so that the oeuvre isn ’ t fragmented even further , " engel added . " the most important thing is that the documents are preserved and made accessible to the public , " commented ulrich von buelow , head of the manuscript department at the archive in marbach . " we 're not participants but merely observers of the case . " hidden literary treasures the tel aviv court recently ordered the opening of the four boxes in the ubs branch in zurich .
the move followed similar action at two tel aviv banks last week where six boxes were opened .
although no one is allowed to say anything about the contents , speculations surfaced on the internet just hours later . " it is known , for instance , that some pages from ' letter to my father , ' a hurt and angry text which he wrote in 1919 and which is seen as the key to understanding the author ’ s mind , are among the contents , " wrote the guardian from london on monday .
" other manuscripts in kafka ’ s hand include ' a country doctor , ' ' wedding preparations in the country , ' and ' a dream . '
they are estimated to be worth several hundred thousand pounds . " truly kafkaesque michael engel does n't expect any new discoveries in the zurich safes .
" however , brod 's diaries should be very interesting .
they most likely contain a lot of biographical information , especially about young kafka , " he said . the author 's sketches and drawings are also particularly interesting to the literary world .
" kafka as an illustrator is a fairly unknown genius , " according to engel . bildunterschrift : franz kafka in prague : four years later , in 1924 , he died of tuberculosis renowned kafka expert itta shedletzky will now compile an inventory of the zurich papers .
when the process is completed , lawyers will present a detailed document to the court and judge talia koppelman will then decide on the rightful owner of the manuscripts , letters and drawings : the hoffe sisters , who can then sell them to the german literature archive - or the national library in jerusalem . twists and turns - if there was ever an instance where the term " kafkaesque " was appropriate this would be it .
and the ending has yet to be written . author : monika griebeler editor : kate bowen / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are estimated to be worth several hundred thousand pounds . " truly kafkaesque michael engel does n't expect any new discoveries in the zurich safes .
" however , brod 's diaries should be very interesting .

" kafka as an illustrator is a fairly unknown genius , " according to engel . bildunterschrift : franz kafka in prague : four years later , in 1924 , he died of tuberculosis renowned kafka expert itta shedletzky will now compile an inventory of the zurich papers .
when the process is completed , lawyers will present a detailed document to the court and judge talia koppelman will then decide on the rightful owner of the manuscripts , letters and drawings : the hoffe sisters , who can then sell them to the german literature archive - or the national library in jerusalem . twists and turns - if there was ever an instance where the term " kafkaesque " was appropriate this would be it .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .

and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "

in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.07.2010 afghans skeptical about kabul conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many afghans wonder where all the aid money has gone the international afghanistan conference in kabul has ended with new plans and pledges for restructuring aid and trying to end militancy in the country .
afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

it could well be the same with bp , since oil concerns often find ways to avoid paying compensation after spills . the second-biggest oil spill in us history happened on march 24 , 1989 when the exxon valdez oil tanker ran aground on the bligh reef in prince william sound , alaska .
the region 's unique , largely untouched coastal landscape was inundated with 40,000 tons of oil that escaped from the vessel , and hundreds of thousands of birds and fish , along with thousands of mammals , died .
public outrage over the spill was huge and the area 's residents were promised generous compensation packages .
however , the reality turned out to be quite different than those affected had hoped .
" there was a famous quote when the exxon valdez happened that said ' lawyers not even born yet will be working on this case . '
and that is indeed what has transpired , " said greenpeace 's cindy baxter , who has followed the exxon disaster for years .
she said exxon has taken the case through numerous courts , with the result being that the original $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- of the estimated compensation amount has been reduced to $ 500 million .
in the meantime , she added , people who were expecting compensation have died during the wait , including clean-up workers who suffered major health problems from working with the dispersants used in the wake of the spill .
low compensation levels she fears that the situation will be similar in the case of the gulf of mexico spill , set off after an explosion on bp 's " deepwater horizon " oil drilling platform .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts fear bp will not pay adequate compensation for the oil leak up to now , bp has paid more than $ 3 billion for damage containment , although only $ 150 million of that is made up of compensation payments to people affected by the massive offshore oil spill , the largest in us history .
in large swaths of the affected areas , whole economic sectors such as fishing and tourism , have come to a standstill .
" the gulf is home to all these different types of fisheries and those fisheries will not recover , " said baxter .
" if you look at the valdez , so many of the fisheries there have not recovered at all . "
not an isolated case but the exxon valdez case is not unique , and the consequences of another oil catastrophe are now being dealt with in amsterdam .
in august 2006 the freighter " probo koala " unloaded around 500 tons of toxic waste on a public dump site in the ivory coast .

the hazardous material was made up of highly toxic oil residue .

those people directly affected by the toxic waste , however , were offered just around $ 1,000 in compensation .
" europe needs to keep its own waste and not come here and make a profit by turning impoverished africa into a trash dump , " said rochel gogoua , one of the victims of the environmental scandal .
" trafigura is criminal in the way it has handed out a pittance to its victims .
the company is a disgrace for the whole world and needs to be shut down . "
but while the company is now facing criminal charges in an amsterdam court over the incident which caused international uproar last year , it is unlikely it will be forced to pay further compensation .

in the first global assessment of the situation for more than ten years , the " world mangrove atlas " paints an honest picture of the depletion of tree and shrub life along tropical and sub-tropical coastlines .
one fifth of all mangroves are thought to have been lost since 1980 , most frequently to shrimp farming , agriculture and coastal development .
it is estimated that the world once boasted some 200,000 square kilometers of the complex shoreline eco-system , but that a quarter of that has been felled in the interests of commercial progress .
uprooted and discarded three or four times more quickly than non-coastal woodland , mangroves have become victims of location .
and in an effort to halt their destruction , scientists have warned of the economic and ecological consequences of negligent behavior .
mark spalding , senior marine scientist at the university of cambridge and lead author of the new atlas , told deutsche welle that in losing their coastal plant life , local communities are invariably the first to suffer .
bildunterschrift : aquaculture , like shrimp farming , can render mangrove regions barren " many of the world 's poorest people live adjacent to mangroves in the tropics , " he said , adding that they do n't stand a chance when wealthy buyers come in and flatten the trees and shrubs to convert the land to shrimp aquaculture . diggers are brought in to create inter-tidal ponds which are flushed with tidal waters and then filled with shrimp and chemicals to ward off illness .
" but eventually the stock picks up a disease , the remnants of which sit in the sediment while the owners move on leaving barren useless land where there used to be mangroves , " spalding said .
good for a few , bad for the rest few locals are invited to work on the farms and with poor fishing yields , as a result of the decimation of their natural habitats , whole communities are suddenly unable to sustain themselves .
jim enright of the asia branch of mangrove action plan -lrb- map -rrb- underscored the depth of the problem for local people generally used to getting everything they need from the saline shrubs and trees that grow in their midst .
bildunterschrift : a red mangrove in florida " we often refer to the mangroves as supermarkets for locals , " enright told deutsche welle .
" people collect snails , crab and fish , building supplies for making fish traps and shelter , and they use plants for traditional medicines and natural dyes . "
it is a lot to have to forego so that a handful of individuals can make a sack of cash , and it 's not even the whole picture .
weathering the storm as well as providing people in africa , south-east asia and latin america with a means of day-to-day survival , mangroves also protect them from the elements .
and in an age where weather disasters are very much in the public consciousness , the critical role of saline forestry in coastal defense can not be overstated . " we know they are very effective in stopping winds and waves , and to a lesser extent , tsunamis , " enright said , adding that they also " protect property and lives " during the strong winds of the monsoon season and the cyclones that batter south-east asia annually .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dense foliage helps break the wind and water fall their tangled mass of roots , shoots and branches act as a buffer for fierce storms rolling in from the sea , and spalding even goes so far as to say that mangroves have what it takes to slow down the frightening process of rising sea levels .
" they allow sediment to settle on the ground so it can build upwards , " he said , adding that there are some deltas where the ground is growing so fast that it will outbid sea level rise .
undoing the damage the hope is that the atlas will help raise awareness of the benefits of these salt-water groves and spur governments and local groups into action to fight against any further destruction while simultaneously working to restore former mangroves to their natural glory .
and there is already significant evidence of a willingness to undo some of the damage done .
tanzania has put all its mangroves under protection , and new trees and shrubs have been planted or encouraged to grow through measures such as waste removal in a range of other countries including australia , brazil , cuba , indonesia , philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beaches of an uninhabited island washed away in the 2004 tsunami map works with local people in thailand on what it calls ecological mangrove restoration , a strategy which entails a detailed historical analysis of the soil and hydrological requirements before planting .
enright says this enhances the chances of successful growth of seeds swept in on the tides , thereby recreating the same richly biodiverse eco-systems of old .
however , getting to the coastal regions in need of gentle cultivation is easier said than done .
talking of the difficulties in gaining access to land abandoned by shrimp farmers , enright said there are a lot of ownership hurdles to be cleared before restoration can begin .
but he and others like him are dedicated to the task in hand .
" on the whole people are doing the right thing , " spalding said .
" but mangroves are still declining too fast and we would be doing the world and ourselves a favor if we would just stop chopping down mangroves altogether . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

now some countries are doing a rethink and making efforts to restore the wetlands . preserving forests is often billed as one of the best ways to counter climate change because of the trees ' carbon-storing properties .
but experts say that another natural habitat plays an equally important role in combating global warming but is often ignored - marshes .
" unfortunately , people are often unaware of the significance of marshes for the climate , " john couwenberg , a researcher at the university of greifswald in eastern germany , said .
bogs and marshlands make up just about three percent of the world 's area but they play an important role in stabilizing temperatures because they store more carbon dioxide than all the forests in the world combined .
marshlands are mainly found in temperate climate zones between the 50th and 70th latitudes .
russia alone is home to a fifth of the world 's wetlands .
large marshlands are also found in canada , scandinavia , in the amazon basin and southeast asia .
couwenberg said it 's believed that africa too has large wetlands - for instance in the congo basin and the niger delta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation of peatlands in indonesia releases massive carbon emissions marshlands are formed when the ground is permanently flooded , as in the vicinity of river banks or when snow melts .
a lack of oxygen in the water means that dead plants decay slower than the rate at which new ones grow above the surface .
that leads to a build-up of peat , which takes over the carbon dioxide previously stored in the plants .
healthy peat absorbs and stores carbon ; but as it degrades , the carbon is released , ending up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide .
the peat layer in the world 's bogs grows at an average rate of a millimeter a year , storing around 150 to 250 tons of carbon dioxide in the ground .
natural climate-killers marshlands have been drained by humans for centuries to make way for farms or to gather wood and other construction materials .
that leads to the degrading of the peat layer , releasing the stored carbon and thus turning the large carbon sink into a dangerous greenhouse gas emitter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat is often used as fuel or fertilizer , which ends up destroying marshes " around the world , around ten percent of all marshlands have been degraded through draining , " couwenberg said .
it 's estimated the resulting release of peat leads to carbon emissions of two billion tons a year .
and they 're far more harmful than the one-off carbon dioxide emissions resulting from deforestation .
the drying-up of marshes releases carbon for as long as it takes for the peat to degrade . the process can take several centuries depending on the thickness of the peat layer .
carbon emissions from drained marshlands has risen by 20 percent worldwide in the last 20 years and developing countries contribute hugely to it .
indonesia has one of the most extensive marshland degradations in the world because entire peat forests in the country have been drained to cultivate oil palms , rice or aloe vera .
huge forest fires regularly break out on the dried up peat , making indonesia the world 's worst polluter when it comes to marshland-related emissions shift in attitudes but a lot of countries have now realized the significant role of bogs in combating climate change and many have begun efforts to revive the wetlands .
projects are underway in belarus , the us , canada , germany and russia where a huge marshland has been designated a protected zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly-built dam in lower saxony has helped to store water and revitalize the hahnenknooper marsh vera luthardt of the german society for marshes and peat research said restoring marshlands often does n't take much more than filling up drained land .
" the first marsh plants such as reeds , moss and sedges often grow within just two or three years , " luthardt said , adding that it however takes up to 15 years for the peat to grow again .
experts say alternative use of marshlands is a must , if they are to play a role in curbing climate change in the future .
and that would involve economic advantages too , such as using the reedbeds in marshlands to generate biomass energy or using efficient modern irrigation techniques .
" there are plenty of ways to protect marshlands and the technology is available as well , " said luthardt .
" but implementation and political conditions are often problematic . "
but politicians might act more quickly to rectify that if they considered that yearly carbon emissions from dried-out marshlands far outstrip emissions produced by traffic worldwide .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "

" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape .

british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .

and those who expose police corruption live dangerously . two men in black threw petrol bombs at the head office of " tempo " magazine in jakarta earlier this month .
no one was hurt and no significant damage was done to the building . through its investigative journalism about corruption involving politicians , businessmen and the police , " tempo " magazine has made many powerful enemies in the past .
the june edition of the magazine featured a cover story with the title " the fat bank accounts of police officers " .
the cover depicts a policeman leading three pig-shaped money boxes on leashes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard walks outside the office of tempo magazine in jakarta intimidation attempts " we are not sure , but obviously either it is people who are unhappy with our investigations into alleged illegal payments to high ranking officers in the police force or people who want to stir trouble , " bambang harymurti , the ceo and chief editor of " tempo " , told deutsche welle about who might be behind the attack .
" it 's probably not from the police as an institution but rather from some police officers who are not very happy with our report .
i think they want to send a message not to mess with us or continue this kind of reporting .
this is an initial attempt to try to clamp down on press freedom . " two days after the attack on the magazine , an indonesian anti-graft activist was also attacked .
tama langkun from indonesia corruption watch was hit on the head as he rode back home on a motorcycle , apparently for speaking out against police corruption . these kinds of attacks remind indonesians of the autocratic suharto regime and raise questions about the strength of the country 's democracy .
bambang harymurti described the consequences : " i 'm sure it has an effect on our work .

it creates an environment of fear .

according to transparency international indonesia , police have now topped the corruption list for the third time in a row .
more than half of all interactions with police are estimated to involve the payment of bribes . as bambang harymurti from " tempo " magazine explained , " recently because of the reform process , the military in indonesia have lost power and the police have gained a lot of power .
in indonesia the problem is that our entire corruption agency has to rely on the police .
therefore it is difficult for the corruption agency to investigate the police .
another reason that the police are corrupt is that they do not have enough money for their operations and police officers only have a meagre salary . " adnan topan husodo , vice- coordinator of indonesian corruption watch , added , " we know that in some areas , the government has introduced some progressive reforms within the police force as an institution .
but we know that the reform is not good enough .
there are still problems in the way the police function . " president susilo bambang yudhoyono has asked the police to investigate the latest attacks .
but in view of the nature of the problem it appears highly unlikely that this approach will lead to the culprits being caught . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.07.2010 germany 's left party fights against surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is struggling to shed its far-left past germany 's left party has for long been under surveillance for alleged extremist tendencies .
the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .
stuck in the cold war the left party is present on all political levels in germany , it has 76 deputies in the national parliament - and it argues the political establishment should rather deal with it in a political debate rather than via the intelligence service .
" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

loew had put off renewing his contract until after the world cup in south africa . germany 's national soccer coach , joachim loew , has extended his contract until the european championship in 2012 in a move welcomed by many in the country 's football community .
" my team and i are very happy to continue working with the dfb -lrb- german football association -rrb- , " loew told a news conference in frankfurt .
" we are looking forward to the next challenges . " loew said he informed several national team players of his decision via cell phone text message . " there have already been some responses , from per mertesacker , miroslav klose and bastian schweinsteiger , " loew said .
" they wished me good luck and many thanks . "
the 50-year-old loew led an impressive young german team to a third-place finish at this year 's fifa world cup in south africa , after losing to eventual champions , spain , in the semi-final .
national manager oliver bierhoff and assistant coach hans-dieter flick have also extended their contracts until euro 2012 , which is to be staged in poland and ukraine .
the new deal comes after protracted contractual wrangling between the dfb and the national coaching team under loew and bierhoff .
talks broke down in february with the pair unhappy that details had been leaked to the media .
loew then said he would leave his decision until after the world cup .
football icons upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has backed loew 's new deal the reappointment has been broadly welcomed by the country 's football community , with former national team coach rudi voeller calling it a " very good decision by all involved .

" the fact that all four are staying is great , " he said .
" now the development of the last few years with the young , talented team can continue .
the basis for the future is there . "
senior national team member michael ballack , whose captaincy of die mannschaft has been under question after he was replaced by philipp lahm at the world cup , also praised loew 's re-appointment .
" i 'm happy the team will remain united .
it has performed excellently together , " said ballack , who returns to the bundesliga this season with his old club bayer leverkusen .
dfb president theo zwanziger , meanwhile , has left his own future open following loew 's contract extension .
the dfb executive committee is to due to deliberate over the presidency in october .
" -lsb- loew 's new deal -rsb- could have some influence , but it 's not vital , " zwanziger said in frankfurt .
" now , i 'm going to spend some time reflecting .
i will think calmly about what is right for the association and what is right for me . "
loew came to prominence as national assistance coach in the lead-up to the 2006 world cup in germany under then-head coach juergen klinsmann .
he assumed the top job when klinsmann stepped down following that tournament .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

a conviction would hinge on proving they knew the girl 's age . a french judge has issued preliminary charges against french international players franck ribery and karim benzema for soliciting an underage prostitute . bayern munich star ribery and benzema , who plays for real madrid , were taken into custody on tuesday for questioning about statements by a self-styled professional escort zahia d. she told police that both players had paid for sex with her when she was a minor but added that they had not known that she was a minor at the time . the pair were interviewed as part of an investigation into a suspected network of prostitutes operating from a nightclub on paris 's prestigious champs elysees , a judicial official told the ap news agency .
in france , a prostitute under the age of 18 is deemed to be underage , and paid sex with a minor can be punished by up to three years in prison and a 45,000 euro -lrb- $ 58,390 -rrb- fine .
' no idea of girl 's age ' both players deny any wrongdoing .
a lawyer for ribery , sophie bottai , said he had no idea the girl was underage , making a conviction impossible .
the girl " would have had to look like a minor and that was not the case , " said bottai .
in addition , she said , the investigation would have to show that she " had informed him that she was underage , which was not the case . "
ribery had already been questioned in april about the affair , which cast a shadow over the french team 's preparation for the world cup .
the former world champions were eliminated from the tournament during the group stage after a series of off-the-pitch problems .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

loew had put off renewing his contract until after the world cup in south africa . germany 's national soccer coach , joachim loew , has extended his contract until the european championship in 2012 in a move welcomed by many in the country 's football community .
" my team and i are very happy to continue working with the dfb -lrb- german football association -rrb- , " loew told a news conference in frankfurt .
" we are looking forward to the next challenges . " loew said he informed several national team players of his decision via cell phone text message . " there have already been some responses , from per mertesacker , miroslav klose and bastian schweinsteiger , " loew said .
" they wished me good luck and many thanks . "
the 50-year-old loew led an impressive young german team to a third-place finish at this year 's fifa world cup in south africa , after losing to eventual champions , spain , in the semi-final .
national manager oliver bierhoff and assistant coach hans-dieter flick have also extended their contracts until euro 2012 , which is to be staged in poland and ukraine .
the new deal comes after protracted contractual wrangling between the dfb and the national coaching team under loew and bierhoff .
talks broke down in february with the pair unhappy that details had been leaked to the media .
loew then said he would leave his decision until after the world cup .

" the fact that all four are staying is great , " he said .
" now the development of the last few years with the young , talented team can continue .
the basis for the future is there . "
senior national team member michael ballack , whose captaincy of die mannschaft has been under question after he was replaced by philipp lahm at the world cup , also praised loew 's re-appointment .
" i 'm happy the team will remain united .
it has performed excellently together , " said ballack , who returns to the bundesliga this season with his old club bayer leverkusen .
dfb president theo zwanziger , meanwhile , has left his own future open following loew 's contract extension .
the dfb executive committee is to due to deliberate over the presidency in october .
" -lsb- loew 's new deal -rsb- could have some influence , but it 's not vital , " zwanziger said in frankfurt .
" now , i 'm going to spend some time reflecting .
i will think calmly about what is right for the association and what is right for me . "
loew came to prominence as national assistance coach in the lead-up to the 2006 world cup in germany under then-head coach juergen klinsmann .
he assumed the top job when klinsmann stepped down following that tournament .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.07.2010 afghans skeptical about kabul conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many afghans wonder where all the aid money has gone the international afghanistan conference in kabul has ended with new plans and pledges for restructuring aid and trying to end militancy in the country .
afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .
in this situation , it will be a big challenge for the afghan army to take full responsibility for security by 2014 , as promised at tuesday 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doubt whether afghan soldiers can take charge of the country 's security by 2014 defense ministry spokesman , general zaher azimi , says the main problem is not the strength of the taliban , but that the afghan forces still lack many things .
" we can not act independently because we do n't have an airforce , for example .
and we totally lack armored vehicles . "
critics blame president critics of president hamid karzai blame him for the lack of progress in the country .
they say he has not come up with solutions for any of afghanistan 's major problems , including the embezzlement of aid money .
yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .
we hope that the international community , if it really is interested in improving the situation , will demand that the afghan government fulfils its promises and will not accept its empty pledges any longer . "
huge sums spent , but where are the results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last international afghanistan conference took place in london on january 28 fokur adds that a lack of cooperation and mutual recriminations between kabul and the international community are to blame for the fact that the goals of the london conference have not been reached at all .
officially , foreign donors have spent altogether about 36 billion dollars -lrb- 28 billion euros -rrb- on the development of afghanistan .
whoever is to blame , many ordinary afghans are simply disappointed about the lack of progress . an angry citizen of kunduz in the northeast speaks for many of his countrymen : " reconstruction does not just mean reconstructing the city .
it also involves setting up factories and creating jobs .
people must feed their children and families .
let them build factories at least !
then i could find work there .
where are the jobs here ?
show them to me ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bank in mazar-e-sharif , where reconstruction has been more successful than elsewhere some islands of hope in the war-ravaged south people are even more desperate .
it is only in relatively secure regions that money has been invested in the infrastructure .
in the northwestern city of mazar-e-sharif , for example , a citizen is quite optimistic : " the reconstruction process in mazar-e-sharif has gone really well .
we are really happy that so much has happened , considering we had three of four decades of war before . "
instilling this spirit of optimism into more afghans is what could really turn the tide in the country .
but afghans have learned the hard way that high-level conferences , goals and promises are not necessarily going to make a difference .
it requires efficient governance and hard work on the ground .

it also agreed to give the afghan government more control over aid money . 2014 has been mentioned as a date for afghans to take over responsibility for their security before .
but this is the first time it has been officially set as a target for the international community and the afghan government .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who was in kabul for the conference , emphasized that 2014 was not a definite pullout date .
" when we talk about handing over responsibility for security in 2014 , this does not mean the same as an exit .
it shows that we want to speed up reconstruction in the country to bring stability .
but it also shows that it is not a mission that is going to last forever . "
bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle talking to afghan president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday doubts about feasibility many observers believe that the setting of this date has been driven by the domestic concerns of western governments , who need to demonstrate to their electorates that this is not an open-ended mission .
given that more international troops died in fighting the taliban during the first half of 2010 than ever before since 2001 , it seems questionable whether the afghan security forces can be boosted enough to control the insurgency on their own , germany-based afghanistan expert mehraj amiri told deutsche welle .
" with all their superior weapons , the international forces have not been able to defeat or even control the taliban .
how is the afghan army , which will still need quite long before it can act on its own , supposed to do it ?
afghanistan has n't been able to build a powerful army for the last nine years , and it wo n't be able to do so in the next three years either . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton at the conference at the conference , us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to dispel fears that the afghan soldiers would be left alone .
" we are working around the clock to strengthen afghanistan 's security forces .
with our afghan partners we are on the offensive in parts of the country where the insurgents have gone unchallenged for too long , and we are matching our military efforts with an unprecedented civilian surge to help create stronger institutions and economic development . "
more aid to be channeled through kabul the one-day conference , which was attended by delegates from about 60 countries and major international organizations , pledged to channel at least 50 percent of international aid through the afghan government within two years .
kabul had insisted to have more control over how aid money is spent .
the meeting also backed the afghan government 's plans to reach out to taliban insurgents who renounce violence .
it was the first time since 2001 that a major international afghanistan conference was held in the country itself .
despite draconian security measures , un secretary general ban ki-moon 's arrival was delayed when his plane had to be diverted following a rocket attack .

afghans , however , remain skeptical . about six months after the last international meeting on afghanistan was held in london , the security situation in the country has not improved at all .
on the contrary : the past six months were the bloodiest since the beginning of the isaf mission in 2001 .

yunus fokur , an expert on domestic politics in the country , argues : " a president who takes more than six months to nominate the ministers in his government can not claim to be a successful politician .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

new hiv research could lead to a vaccine health -pipe- 20.07.2010 aids researchers push for harm reduction to reduce hiv infection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most countries in europe have needle exchanges like this one , ganslwirt , in vienna outside of sub-saharan africa , one third of hiv infections are connected with sharing drug needles , which is why many researchers have called for more public health programs like needle exchanges at the ganslwirt needle exchange facility in vienna 's sixth district , users of heroin and other opiate drugs gather from across the city .
one 20-year-old austrian man , stefan , who declined to give his last name , says that he comes here , as do most people , to drop off their used needles in exchange for clean ones .
" it 's very important for me to be able to change needles here , " stefan said .
" otherwise i 'd have to ask friends to use their needles which would be very dangerous . "
needle exchange and treatments like opiate substitution therapy -lrb- ost -rrb- form the core of what public health and public policy officials call " harm reduction , " and they have become a central facet of many european and north american governments ' strategy in fighting hiv transmission through intravenous drug use over the past ten to twenty years .
in a handful of countries with the most progressive drug policies , such as canada and switzerland , further harm reduction services employ techniques and treatments such as supervised injecting facilities and the provision of pharmaceutical heroin and morphine , which researchers say are highly successful in ending drug dependence and limiting hiv infection . but outside the west , it 's a different picture .
" right now , almost one third of all hiv infections outside of sub-saharan africa are associated with the sharing of drug injection equipment , " said dr. don des jarlais , director of the baron edmond de rothchild chemical dependency institute in new york , " and that leads to sexual transmission from drug users to the general population . "
dr. des jarlais is at the global hiv / aids conference being held in vienna this week to launch the vienna declaration , a two-page policy " call to action " that he has drafted along with some 30 other preeminent hiv scientists and specialists around the world .
the declaration 's core demand is that governments reform their drug policy , moving away from policies that view drug users as criminals and toward policies that see them as patients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists estimate there are nearly 600,000 hiv-positive drug users in russia this , dr. des jarlais and his colleagues argue , will help western countries drive down their stabilized hiv infection rates even further and enable states in eastern europe , russia and central asia to put the brakes on a burgeoning hiv epidemic among drug users there .
russia , central asia and eastern europe need more harm reduction policies , researchers say according to the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , russia has an estimated 1.6 million intravenous drug users , and 37 percent of them are thought to be hiv positive .
they make up some 80 percent of russia 's total hiv epidemic and this grim picture is replicated throughout eastern europe and central asia .
the framers of the vienna declaration and other hiv experts directly attribute these statistics to the what they describe as " draconian " drug laws in effect in the region .
" people are afraid to use health services .
they are afraid to go to the hospital because they do n't want to be exposed to the fear of police arrest or abuse from police and so on , " says anya sarang , president of the andrey ryklov foundation for health and social justice , in moscow .
" in this atmosphere of fear and terror and risk , it will be impossible to achieve very high level of activeness of hiv treatment or prevention programs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that ukraine is considered one of the hiv / aids worst eastern european countries so far , needle exchange programs have been successful in north america and western europe , and now researchers want to expand this policy in other regions : particularly eastern europe , russia and central asia .
the declaration also calls for further legal reforms in western countries as well .
in fact , just last week , the obama administration announced a new strategy in the fight against hiv in america – setting itself the target of reducing infections by 25 percent in five years .
ethan nadelmann , executive director of the drugs policy alliance , a reform advocacy group , says this new attitude will bring federal funding to existing harm reduction services across the country which have been typically funded on the state level .
this is a positive move , he says , but it is tempered by america 's enormous incarceration rates .
in america today , as elsewhere , the war on drugs is locking horns with the fight against aids .
" in the u.s. we have less than 5 percent of the world 's population but almost 25 percent of the world 's incarcerated population , " he said .
" we 've gone from 50,000 behind bars for drug offense in 1980 to half a million today almost a ten-fold increase .
we lock up more people in the u.s. for violating a drug law than all of western europe locks up for everything and western europe has 100 million more people than we do . "
nadelmann and other hiv / aids policy activists and researchers say that the american drug policy needs to be re-thought , and brought more into line with western europe .
one drug user is grateful for needle exchange back at the vienna needle exchange , stefan says he feels fortunate to live in austria .
he 's nearing his third year of addiction to heroin but , he says , recovering from it would be impossible – and dangerous – if it were n't for facilities such as the needle exchange .
" i do n't want to die from this , " he said .
" my brother already died from drugs and i was silly enough to start taking them .
i want to stop and facilities like this can be very helpful on my way out .
there should be facilities like this in every country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer affairs -pipe- 20.07.2010 broccoli and tomato patents under scrutiny at european patent office großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weapon in the fight against cancer : broccoli at the european patent office in munich , there are some tasty patents on the table for debate .
the office 's appeals board is debating whether patents on broccoli and tomatoes can be allowed . vegetables are , whether we like them or not , a healthy dietary choice .
broccoli , for example , contains potentially cancer-fighting properties .
in 2002 , a british company called plant bioscience ltd .
-lrb- pbl -rrb- was granted a patent by the european patent office -lrb- epo -rrb- for a method it developed which identified the anti-carcinogenic properties of broccoli , enabling the company to selectively breed plants with a high concentration of this property .
but the patent also covered the plants selected and produced by this method , not just the technical process itself , essentially giving the british company a european patent on broccoli .
a swiss company filed an appeal with the epo , saying that what is essentially a biological process is not patentable .
a similar patent was granted in 2000 to an israeli company that had found a way to breed tomatoes with less water , but an appeal was lodged against that in 2004 on the same grounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomatoes with less water are also up for patent talks starting tuesday in munich , the epo 's enlarged board of appeal will review the two patents to determine whether these breeding processes and selection methods are biological processes or patentable technological processes .
produce problems in germany , however , many people have already decided : you ca n't put a patent on vegetables .
there are fears that if the patent is allowed to stand , it will have negative consequences for independent farmers and consumers .
" in general , patents like these cause a concentration of the market , " said christian then , a patent advisor for greenpeace , on german ard television .
" selection is reduced , and prices go up . "
patents like this exist already , but the current decision on the broccoli patent will set a precedent and affect future cases regarding plant or animal patents .
" if it 's confirmed , the floodgates would be open , " said then .
" there are already around a thousand patent applications for produce and livestock breeding . "
josef hecker is a german farmer with a small output of organic produce .
he told ard he 's already seen the effects of patented produce .
" recently on the produce market there has been such a concentration of patented goods that other types are starting to disappear ; " hecker said .
" people are deciding to buy the patented products , and other , worthy kinds of produce are becoming hard to find . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbl claims it took innovative technology to cultivate its broccoli responsible for innovation , not impact the european patent office points out in a statement on its website that its only responsibility is to determine whether a new technology is innovative and applicable enough to be given a patent .
in an email to deutsche welle , pbl said its broccoli breeding techniques were advanced enough to warrant patent protection . " the inventors used a mixture of classic techniques and technology assisted selection processes to access very widely divergent members of the broccoli family , " said pbl 's statement .
the selected nutritional traits were " not available in the ' population ' of modern cultivated broccoli . " " even with modern techniques , implementing such ' wide crossing ' strategies -lsb- … -rsb- remains a significant technical challenge . " broccoli politics according to the patent office , assessments of social , economic , or ecological implications are best left to lawmakers and regulatory bodies . that means new european regulations that specifically ban patents like these would be needed to stop the broccoli initiative - an idea greenpeace 's christoph then supports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister aigner does n't want to see patents for produce " bans that are currently there are n't clear enough .
there are exceptions to the bans , and it 's possible to get around them , " he said .
" the only way to solve the problem is politically .
the patent laws have to be changed and clear bans implemented . " pbl agrees to some extent - patent restrictions should be in place for things like abstract ideas or laws of nature .
but they see their innovation as a clear technological advancement . " where human ingenuity is involved in the creation of innovations to achieve important outcomes , we are in favour of patentability , provided the other patenting requirements -lrb- novelty , inventive step -rrb- are met . " from the political arena , german agriculture minister ilse aigner is against produce patents .
she told ard television that such patents would corner the market .
" if we 're talking about living organisms , produce , and livestock , then i think there should n't be any exclusive rights , " she said .
" there ca n't be a financial gain for just one person or company . "
the appeals board at the european patent office is set to wrap up the debate on the broccoli patent this week , but the decision will probably not be made public until later in the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.07.2010 germany 's left party fights against surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is struggling to shed its far-left past germany 's left party has for long been under surveillance for alleged extremist tendencies .
the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .
stuck in the cold war the left party is present on all political levels in germany , it has 76 deputies in the national parliament - and it argues the political establishment should rather deal with it in a political debate rather than via the intelligence service .
" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

the party is rooted in former east germany 's communist past .
a court case is now to determine whether surveillance is justified . surveillance of the left party has been controversial for years .
its partial roots in the former east german communist party have led to concern over extremist tendencies amongst its rank and file .
yet the left party has been elected into many city and state parliaments - it 's even in a number of regional coalitions with bigger parties .
and it 's an established - though small - party in the national parliament , the bundestag .
several of the party 's mps have gone to court over the issue and on wednesday , a verdict by the federal administrative court in leipzig is expected to determine once and for all whether or not there are enough grounds to justify surveillance of the party and its members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodo ramelow won the case for himself and is now fighting for his party left party politician bodo ramelow is at the center of the current legal battle .
he went to court in 2009 and won - yet the verdict only applied to his person .
" they must be really afraid of potential threats coming from the left of the political spectrum , " ramelow said .
" they 're monitoring flyers and websites - that really is nonsense .
there are other things wrong in this country that need much more attention . "
communists , marxists , radicals ?
two years ago , the head of the domestic intelligence service , heinz fromm , suggested there may come a time when it would be out of proportion to monitor the entire party if there are only a few individual cases that cause concern .
" should the situation really be that we 're only thinking about individual cases , then we continually have to put this into perspective as to whether this justifies our agency being busy with this , " fromm said bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party stands accused of sympathising with left-wing extremism and violence but so far , nothing has changed ; the left party is still under surveillance .
in the current annual report by the domestic intelligence service , there are a full seven pages dedicated to the party .
" on the one hand the party is gearing its public appearance towards being perceived as a reform-oriented new leftist party .
but at the same time there are still many indicators for left wing extremism .
those are in particular the unclear stance towards left wing extremist violence and the open acceptance of extremist alliances among its own members , " the report says .
the extremist alliances referred to are for instance the " communist platform " or the " marxist forum " within the party .
parliament 's vice president also under surveillance petra pau is a member of the left party , and a member of the national parliament - in fact , she 's its vice president .
for years she 's been trying to obtain access to the file that the intelligence service has on her .
that file is believed to be some 600 pages long - and pau has been permitted to see some of it , but some sections remain classified .
" one of the main entries is : ' petra pau has been elected vice president of parliament . ' now there might be an intelligence officer who does n't particularly like that - but it surely ca n't be listed as a proof of my unconstitutional mindset , " pau said .
" but the government is trying to use this information in a public debate .
and i think that is not acceptable , " she added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pau is vice president of parliament and still has a classified personal file what pau wants is to have access to her file and then have it deleted .
stuck in the cold war the left party is present on all political levels in germany , it has 76 deputies in the national parliament - and it argues the political establishment should rather deal with it in a political debate rather than via the intelligence service .
" the fact that i could sue - and actually won - is proof that the judicial system in this country works , " ramelow says . " but those observing us really still have their heads stuck in the cold war . "
ramelow hopes the federal administrative court in leipzig will confirm the earlier rulings - and turn them into a general precedent that no member of the left party can be put under surveillance for reason of his or her party affiliation alone .

" i remain determined that our afghan national security forces will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country by 2014 , " karzai told delegates from 70 nations , including 40 foreign ministers , who had assembled in kabul for the one-day summit , the first ever of its kind on afghan territory .
the final communique by participants of the conference - which is to focus on corruption , development and security - backed karzai 's target to assume responsibility from the estimated 140,000 us and nato troops stationed in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says nato troops will play a supporting role speaking on the sidelines of the conference , german foreign minister guido westerwelle told public broadcaster ard that the handover of security responsibilities should take place in 2014 , adding that this was the " self-imposed goal " of the afghan leader .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , speaking in response to karzai 's security pledge , said that kabul 's plans were " comprehensive " and that us forces would begin pulling out of afghanistan in july , 2011 .
" -lsb- this -rsb- date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve , " clinton said .
" the transition process is too important to push off indefinitely .
but this date is the start of a new phase , not the end of our involvement . "
nato supporting role nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen , meanwhile , said any withdrawal of international forces should be based on the situation on the ground , and not on any calendar date .
" what we are speaking about is a gradual process where we hand over lead responsibility to the afghans when conditions permit , and the word ' condition ' is very important because this process must be conditions-based and not calendar-driven , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai wants foreign aid funnelled through the government " and when it happens , international forces wo n't leave - they will simply move into a supporting role , " he said , adding : " we have not come this far , at this cost , to falter just as we see our common goal take shape . "
british prime minister david cameron , speaking from washington where he was visiting us president barack obama , said the four-year target was realistic .
afghan aid the conference communique also restated support for calls by karzai for the international community to channel at least 50 percent of development aid to the country through the afghan government .
" our systems are strong and improving , and we are committed to working with donors to give them the confidence needed to channel resources through the afghan budget , " karzai said earlier .
over $ 40 billion -lrb- 30.8 billion euros -rrb- has been spent on afghanistan since 2002 , according to humanitarian organization oxfam .
around half of this sum went towards training and equipping the afghan army and police force .
