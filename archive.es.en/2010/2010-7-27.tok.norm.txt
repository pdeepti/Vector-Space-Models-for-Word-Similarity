the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 27.07.2010 nuclear fusion reactor faces delays , budget woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iter could be the first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor iter involves a multinational effort to harness energy produced through nuclear fusion .
this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .

incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .

' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

but would the title benefit the region ? the unesco world heritage committee is currently holding its annual 10-day conference in brasilia , brazil , to consider requests for the inscription of 32 new sites on the unesco world heritage list , including one site in germany : the upper harz water management system in lower saxony . the water management system consists of a series of dams , underground water wheels and chambers , and a water drainage canal , all with origin dates ranging from the year 1150 to 1805 . " there are no other sites globally that present what the upper harz system is , a preindustrial system of energy , " dieter offenhaeusser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission , told deutsche welle . if accepted , the water management system would be an extension of two existing world heritage sites - the rammelsberg mines and the historic town of goslar .
the water management system had served the mines , which provided ore deposits that contributed to the commercial success of the so-called hanseatic league , an economic trade alliance during the middle ages . bildunterschrift : miners built the system so they would have access to water in the dry seasons world heritage status a golden ticket ? the unesco status can bring prestige and notoriety to a region or city , as well as financial benefits - either in the way of tourism or by making it easier to receive financial assistance from political institutions . still , it 's unclear just which advantages the world heritage title would bring the upper harz region , particularly because it would be an extension of an existing site . " it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , so if the world heritage property is enlarged , we ca n't count whether there are more tourists , " offenhaeusser said . maintaining and preserving a site " is a big responsibility , " added .
" the world heritage site takes a lot of work on that side . " hans-georg dettmer , research associate and spokesperson for the world cultural heritage museum and visitor center in rammelsberg , echoed these concerns : " to be listed as a part of the cultural heritage , it is absolutely necessary that the owners of the mining monuments have a concept of how to save and preserve these monuments . " the eastern german city of dresden deliberately changed its concept when it decided to build a four-lane bridge across the river elbe to ease traffic congestion going into the city .
unesco removed the elbe valley 's world heritage title last year , saying the bridge marred the landscape . " to be precise , i do n't know -lsb- if the change of status has affected tourism -rsb- .
i know it was a loss of reputation , not only for the region , but also for germany , " offenhaeusser said .
the dresden tourist office was unavailable for comment . bildunterschrift : the water management system borders on two existing unesco sites personal commitment out of the ashes certainly , economic benefits are n't necessarily unesco 's main aim in naming world heritage sites .
guenter blobel , founder of the non-profit organization friends of dresden which worked to retain the city 's world heritage status , has a personal connection to the city .
as a child during world war ii , he crossed through dresden with his family as they fled their hometown in silesia . " i traveled there a few days before it was bombed , so i have seen the beauty of the city , " he said .
" a couple days later it was converted into ashes .
i then saw it again at the end of may and saw it completely destroyed , and i said if i ever have a chance to do something toward its reconstruction , i would do it . " blobel , who donated the prize money he earned in 1999 from winning the nobel prize in physiology or medicine to the reconstruction of dresden , lost the campaign to maintain dresden 's protected status because the city set other priorities . whether the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco site will be decided this week . the unesco representatives , who convene in brasilia until august 3 , are also considering nominations from the marshall islands , kiriabati and tajikistan , three countries that currently have no world heritage sites .
other sites under consideration are the austrian city of graz , the jantar mantar and matheran railway in india , the prehistoric caves of yagul aand mitla in mexico 's central valley of oaxaca , and the koso cultural landscape in ethiopia . to date , the world heritage list includes 890 properties ; 33 are located in germany . bildunterschrift : the existing bridges crossing the elbe river were deemed too small to manage traffic needs author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .

the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .

according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .

the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .

" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .

but because the process is tedious , many find it hard to land gainful jobs . sixty-two year old ardit singh fled kabul in 1992 for delhi , after the fall of the moscow backed-government and soon after civil war erupted .
at that time , he says there were around 20,000 hindus and sikhs in afghanistan .
after the taliban took over in 1997 , there was a greater exodus , and today only a few hundred hindus and sikhs are left in afghanistan .
ardit singh says he has had a tough time getting indian citizenship .
to be eligible , a refugee must have lived in india for 12 years or have been married to an indian for seven years .
the length of stay must be supported by documentation – a residence permit issued by the indian government – for it to count towards naturalization .
" there are so many who are poor and many have not got citizenship , " says ardit singh .
" i applied for one in 2003 and applied personally .
i applied for four people in my family .
my daughter , son and i have got it but not my wife .
there are many cases like this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandahar is considered a stronghold of the taliban support from ngos many of the afghan sikhs who fled to india owned farm lands , vineyards , big houses and were a thriving business community in east afghanistan .
but now , hundreds of families find they can not even conduct a legitimate business because of their indeterminate status .
at a non-governmental organization set up in 1998 by sikhs from afghanistan , singh tries to help the poorer families .
" we have opened up the khalsa diwan for educating poor children .
we pay for their school fees through this organization .
the khalsa diwan is old , it was there also in afghanistan . "
the never ending wait the incredibly long process for citizenship deters many from applying .
once an application for naturalization is filed , the applicant is not allowed to leave india until the end of the process .
there are some families where the women have applied and the men have not , keeping open their option to return to afghanistan should the opportunity arise .
" the process is slightly long , " explains nayana bose from the un refugee agency unhcr .
" it takes on an average 2 to 3 years after the forms have been submitted because it has to go through various government authorities – at the delhi level , the district and central level and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many afghan hindus and sikhs are disappointed with the indian government desire to become indian assimilation to indian society is easier for the refugees .
there is a greater sense of identity being familiar with the language and culture .
narender singh , who fled kandahar after the taliban takeover , says many families have stayed afloat in india through sheer determination .
" our community has worked hard .
we are not scared of anything .
be it day or night , we can toil and take on any work .
we have been here for 18 years , i have not asked for alms .
but i am disappointed with the indian government . "
though many refugees still cherish memories of the famous dry fruits and the streets of kabul , most have decided to make india their home .
their only desire is to become indian citizens . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2010 iceland begins eu accession talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland applied for eu membership last year iceland kicks off lengthy eu accession talks in brussels on tuesday , with fisheries and banking expected to be divisive issues .
but opposition could also come from at home , as public support for membership wanes . iceland is beginning formal accession talks with the european union on tuesday , following the approval of the bloc 's foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu ministers agreed a " negotiating framework " on monday , despite differences over such issues as whale hunting and the icelandic banking collapse that hit british and dutch investors in 2008 .
iceland is already a member of the schengen border-free travel zone and the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , and hopes to join the bloc in about two years ' time .
" it is clear things might go smoothly on a certain number of subjects , " said steven vanackere , belgium 's foreign minister , following the meeting in brussels on monday .
however , iceland 's bid could face opposition from some eu countries .
" there are other chapters on which the eu knows efforts will have to be made by iceland .
think of ... the financial sector , " vanackere said .
the british and dutch governments want the prospective member to refund billions of euros they handed out in compensation to their own citizens who lost deposits as a result of the collapse of online bank icesave .
icelanders , however , rejected a payout plan in a referendum earlier this year , and further repayment talks have been unsuccessful .
though the issue will not formally be part of the eu accession talks , it could end up being a stumbling block to eventual membership .
fulfilment of efta rules is necessary to qualify for eu membership , and those rules require iceland to resolve its debt dispute .
public support down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icelanders were n't happy with how the government handled the economy iceland 's eu bid also faces challenges at home .
the country 's application for eu membership last year , following the collapse of its banking sector , won slim political support and icelanders will still have to support the decision in a referendum .
an opinion poll carried out in june by capacent gallup showed that nearly 60 percent of icelanders are in favor of the government withdrawing the country 's application , due in part to the banking issue .
only a quarter of those polled opposed such a move .
" you have to want to join europe , " said france 's eu minister , pierre lellouche .
" i do n't have the impression from the opinion polls that the icelanders themselves are very favorable : that 's the problem . "
" the whole idea of having public support for the operation is something which has been raised during -lsb- monday 's -rsb- meeting .
there needs to be public support from the people of iceland , " said belgium 's vanackere .
no special treatment despite hopes that talks might wrap up early and allow iceland to join by 2012 , ahead of turkey and candidate countries in the balkans , ministers said there would be no special treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's whaling industry may be shut down to meet eu regulations iceland will be subject to " exactly the same kind of scrutiny and seriousness as any other candidate , " said vanackere .
the process is expected to take at least 12 to 18 months , as the northern nation brings its laws in line with eu standards .
oessur skarphedinsson , iceland 's foreign minister , said he did n't expect the real negotiations to begin until the mid-2011 , when discussions on divisive issues such as fisheries , agriculture , financial services and the environment are expected to take place .
to join the eu , iceland may have to shut down its whale hunting industry and open up its lucrative fishing areas to eu member states , a point expected to be controversial .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony . " together with the relatives and the friends , as well as with the injured and all those involved we wish to mourn and try to find solace , " hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier hannelore kraft visited the scene on sunday the service will take place in duisburg 's protestant salvatorkirche church , with a large screen in an adjacent city square relaying the events inside .
a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .
" that is his decision , " she said , but went on to add , " in the end it will also be a matter of political responsibility . " kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate . " we are not yet in a position to determine what triggered the sequence of events , " a police spokeswoman said , adding , " it would be good if mr schaller did not lose himself in speculation .

he has also faced scathing criticism from several media outlets . the mayor resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right . a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily said that sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

hayward , savaged for his handling of the gulf of mexico oil leak , is resigning as the british-based company strives to rebuild its us image . embattled bp chief executive tony hayward is stepping down as the firm tries to repair its shattered reputation in the united states following the gulf of mexico oil disaster . " bp today announced that , by mutual agreement with the bp board , tony hayward is to step down as group chief executive with effect from october 1 , 2010 , " the company said in a statement . hayward has been strongly criticized for a series of public relations gaffes in his handling of what is now considered the worst environmental disaster in us history . " i believe that it is not possible for the company to move on in the united states with me remaining as the face to bp , " hayward told reporters on a conference call .
" so i think that for the good of bp , and particularly for the good of bp in the united states , it is right for me to step down . " hayward , who is british , is to be replaced by american robert dudley , currently an executive director in charge of the oil spill clean-up operation in the gulf of mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spill is the biggest in the history of the united states among the perceived mistakes that hayward was criticized for was a comment about the personal toll that the disaster had been taking on himself .
" i want my life back , " hayward said in may . the white house also took him to task after he was photographed taking a holiday from the clear-up of the oil-choked gulf to sail his yacht in crystal-clear waters off britain .
huge losses hayward is to remain on the board of the company until november 30 and then move as a non-executive director to one of bp 's russian joint ventures .
the company also announced a second quarter loss of $ 17.1 billion -lrb- 13.17 billion euros -rrb- on tuesday , one of the biggest losses in british corporate history .
in the past five years , bp has had to deal with three of the oil industry 's most expensive safety and environmental incidents .
an explosion in a texas refinery in 2005 killed 15 workers , while an oil spill in alaska one year later led to millions of dollars in fines .
the oil leak in the gulf of mexico was caused by the explosion and subsequent sinking of the oil rig deepwater horizon in april of this year , which killed 11 workers .
bp was the largest british company by market capitalization at the time of the explosion , but has seen its market share plunge by about 36 percent since april .
hayward took over as chief executive of bp from lord browne in 2007 .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony .

a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .

" kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate .

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony . " together with the relatives and the friends , as well as with the injured and all those involved we wish to mourn and try to find solace , " hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier hannelore kraft visited the scene on sunday the service will take place in duisburg 's protestant salvatorkirche church , with a large screen in an adjacent city square relaying the events inside .
a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .
" that is his decision , " she said , but went on to add , " in the end it will also be a matter of political responsibility . " kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate .

he has also faced scathing criticism from several media outlets . the mayor resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right . a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily said that sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

hayward , savaged for his handling of the gulf of mexico oil leak , is resigning as the british-based company strives to rebuild its us image . embattled bp chief executive tony hayward is stepping down as the firm tries to repair its shattered reputation in the united states following the gulf of mexico oil disaster . " bp today announced that , by mutual agreement with the bp board , tony hayward is to step down as group chief executive with effect from october 1 , 2010 , " the company said in a statement . hayward has been strongly criticized for a series of public relations gaffes in his handling of what is now considered the worst environmental disaster in us history . " i believe that it is not possible for the company to move on in the united states with me remaining as the face to bp , " hayward told reporters on a conference call .
" so i think that for the good of bp , and particularly for the good of bp in the united states , it is right for me to step down . " hayward , who is british , is to be replaced by american robert dudley , currently an executive director in charge of the oil spill clean-up operation in the gulf of mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spill is the biggest in the history of the united states among the perceived mistakes that hayward was criticized for was a comment about the personal toll that the disaster had been taking on himself .
" i want my life back , " hayward said in may . the white house also took him to task after he was photographed taking a holiday from the clear-up of the oil-choked gulf to sail his yacht in crystal-clear waters off britain .
huge losses hayward is to remain on the board of the company until november 30 and then move as a non-executive director to one of bp 's russian joint ventures .
the company also announced a second quarter loss of $ 17.1 billion -lrb- 13.17 billion euros -rrb- on tuesday , one of the biggest losses in british corporate history .
in the past five years , bp has had to deal with three of the oil industry 's most expensive safety and environmental incidents .
an explosion in a texas refinery in 2005 killed 15 workers , while an oil spill in alaska one year later led to millions of dollars in fines .
the oil leak in the gulf of mexico was caused by the explosion and subsequent sinking of the oil rig deepwater horizon in april of this year , which killed 11 workers .
bp was the largest british company by market capitalization at the time of the explosion , but has seen its market share plunge by about 36 percent since april .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

but opposition could also come from at home , as public support for membership wanes . iceland is beginning formal accession talks with the european union on tuesday , following the approval of the bloc 's foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu ministers agreed a " negotiating framework " on monday , despite differences over such issues as whale hunting and the icelandic banking collapse that hit british and dutch investors in 2008 .
iceland is already a member of the schengen border-free travel zone and the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , and hopes to join the bloc in about two years ' time .
" it is clear things might go smoothly on a certain number of subjects , " said steven vanackere , belgium 's foreign minister , following the meeting in brussels on monday .
however , iceland 's bid could face opposition from some eu countries .
" there are other chapters on which the eu knows efforts will have to be made by iceland .
think of ... the financial sector , " vanackere said .
the british and dutch governments want the prospective member to refund billions of euros they handed out in compensation to their own citizens who lost deposits as a result of the collapse of online bank icesave .
icelanders , however , rejected a payout plan in a referendum earlier this year , and further repayment talks have been unsuccessful .
though the issue will not formally be part of the eu accession talks , it could end up being a stumbling block to eventual membership .
fulfilment of efta rules is necessary to qualify for eu membership , and those rules require iceland to resolve its debt dispute .
public support down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icelanders were n't happy with how the government handled the economy iceland 's eu bid also faces challenges at home .
the country 's application for eu membership last year , following the collapse of its banking sector , won slim political support and icelanders will still have to support the decision in a referendum .
an opinion poll carried out in june by capacent gallup showed that nearly 60 percent of icelanders are in favor of the government withdrawing the country 's application , due in part to the banking issue .
only a quarter of those polled opposed such a move .
" you have to want to join europe , " said france 's eu minister , pierre lellouche .
" i do n't have the impression from the opinion polls that the icelanders themselves are very favorable : that 's the problem . "
" the whole idea of having public support for the operation is something which has been raised during -lsb- monday 's -rsb- meeting .
there needs to be public support from the people of iceland , " said belgium 's vanackere .
no special treatment despite hopes that talks might wrap up early and allow iceland to join by 2012 , ahead of turkey and candidate countries in the balkans , ministers said there would be no special treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's whaling industry may be shut down to meet eu regulations iceland will be subject to " exactly the same kind of scrutiny and seriousness as any other candidate , " said vanackere .
the process is expected to take at least 12 to 18 months , as the northern nation brings its laws in line with eu standards .
oessur skarphedinsson , iceland 's foreign minister , said he did n't expect the real negotiations to begin until the mid-2011 , when discussions on divisive issues such as fisheries , agriculture , financial services and the environment are expected to take place .
to join the eu , iceland may have to shut down its whale hunting industry and open up its lucrative fishing areas to eu member states , a point expected to be controversial .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

rear admiral greg smith , communication director of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , has already rejected speculation about alleged civilian casualties .
a nato statement said that isaf and afghan national army forces were attacked with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades and retaliated with attack helicopters and guided missiles killing six insurgents in the process .
allied forces ' fire struck the intended targets , the statement claimed . remains of missing us sailor found separately , nato reported on tuesday that the remains of a us sailor who has been missing since friday have been recovered after an extensive search-and-recovery operation .

kidnappings of foreign soldiers are rare in afghanistan since most kidnappings are committed by criminals to obtain ransom payments . no surprises in wikileaks : german defense minister meanwhile , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said that the revelations in wikileaks regarding afghanistan have not sprung any surprises on the german government .
even the presence of a us commando unit in north afghanistan had been common knowledge in informed circles for years .
according to information published in wikileaks , us task force 373 has been stationed in the area under the supervision of the german army .

but would the title benefit the region ? the unesco world heritage committee is currently holding its annual 10-day conference in brasilia , brazil , to consider requests for the inscription of 32 new sites on the unesco world heritage list , including one site in germany : the upper harz water management system in lower saxony . the water management system consists of a series of dams , underground water wheels and chambers , and a water drainage canal , all with origin dates ranging from the year 1150 to 1805 . " there are no other sites globally that present what the upper harz system is , a preindustrial system of energy , " dieter offenhaeusser , deputy secretary general of the german unesco commission , told deutsche welle . if accepted , the water management system would be an extension of two existing world heritage sites - the rammelsberg mines and the historic town of goslar .
the water management system had served the mines , which provided ore deposits that contributed to the commercial success of the so-called hanseatic league , an economic trade alliance during the middle ages . bildunterschrift : miners built the system so they would have access to water in the dry seasons world heritage status a golden ticket ? the unesco status can bring prestige and notoriety to a region or city , as well as financial benefits - either in the way of tourism or by making it easier to receive financial assistance from political institutions . still , it 's unclear just which advantages the world heritage title would bring the upper harz region , particularly because it would be an extension of an existing site . " it could affect tourism , but i do n't know how it would affect it because harz is already a tourist region , so if the world heritage property is enlarged , we ca n't count whether there are more tourists , " offenhaeusser said . maintaining and preserving a site " is a big responsibility , " added .
" the world heritage site takes a lot of work on that side . " hans-georg dettmer , research associate and spokesperson for the world cultural heritage museum and visitor center in rammelsberg , echoed these concerns : " to be listed as a part of the cultural heritage , it is absolutely necessary that the owners of the mining monuments have a concept of how to save and preserve these monuments . " the eastern german city of dresden deliberately changed its concept when it decided to build a four-lane bridge across the river elbe to ease traffic congestion going into the city .
unesco removed the elbe valley 's world heritage title last year , saying the bridge marred the landscape . " to be precise , i do n't know -lsb- if the change of status has affected tourism -rsb- .
i know it was a loss of reputation , not only for the region , but also for germany , " offenhaeusser said .
the dresden tourist office was unavailable for comment . bildunterschrift : the water management system borders on two existing unesco sites personal commitment out of the ashes certainly , economic benefits are n't necessarily unesco 's main aim in naming world heritage sites .
guenter blobel , founder of the non-profit organization friends of dresden which worked to retain the city 's world heritage status , has a personal connection to the city .
as a child during world war ii , he crossed through dresden with his family as they fled their hometown in silesia . " i traveled there a few days before it was bombed , so i have seen the beauty of the city , " he said .
" a couple days later it was converted into ashes .
i then saw it again at the end of may and saw it completely destroyed , and i said if i ever have a chance to do something toward its reconstruction , i would do it . " blobel , who donated the prize money he earned in 1999 from winning the nobel prize in physiology or medicine to the reconstruction of dresden , lost the campaign to maintain dresden 's protected status because the city set other priorities . whether the upper harz water management system will become germany 's 34th unesco site will be decided this week . the unesco representatives , who convene in brasilia until august 3 , are also considering nominations from the marshall islands , kiriabati and tajikistan , three countries that currently have no world heritage sites .
other sites under consideration are the austrian city of graz , the jantar mantar and matheran railway in india , the prehistoric caves of yagul aand mitla in mexico 's central valley of oaxaca , and the koso cultural landscape in ethiopia . to date , the world heritage list includes 890 properties ; 33 are located in germany . bildunterschrift : the existing bridges crossing the elbe river were deemed too small to manage traffic needs author : rebecca farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .

" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "

while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .

and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 27.07.2010 amnesty report faults greek government for detaining asylum seekers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is a gateway for immigrants into the eu greece , like other southern european countries , is the gateway for many refugees and asylum seekers into the eu .
but human rights group amnesty international says these migrants are often abused by greek authorities . a report released by amnesty international on tuesday blasted greece for its treatment of irregular migrants and asylum seekers , saying the government often treats them as criminals and violates their human rights .
the report details several cases of asylum seekers and irregular migrants , or those without legal status , being held for long periods of time in cramped detention quarters while their cases awaited review .
" greece completely forgets that asylum is a right and not a crime , " monika lueke , general secretary of amnesty international in germany , told deutsche welle .
" if greece ignores the asylum regulation then greece can be taken not only to the european court of human rights , but also to the european court of justice for violation of european union law . "
according to the report , those detained often lacked access to clean water , medical treatment or legal representation , and that some cases involved unaccompanied minors .
in the report 's conclusion , amnesty calls on greek authorities to undertake a " comprehensive overhaul " of its legislation and policies relating to migration and to use detention only as a measure of last resort , as stipulated in european and international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lueke says germany needs to stop sending immigrants back to greece reform underway andreas takis , greece 's secretary-general of migration policy and former ombudsman on human rights , said that many incidents like those mentioned in amnesty 's report are true , and that they are " important and not pleasing at all to the greek administration . "
" to be sincere , this is not something different , it 's just kind of a repetition of very intense problems that the previous government , and the previous-previous government were also facing , " he said .
he added that the government was already in the process of reforming its asylum laws , and that it was considering moving authority over detention centers - many of which are on islands on the frontier - from local authorities to the federal police .
but lueke said that despite commitments from the government to reform the system , nothing has yet changed .
" our people have been to the -lrb- detention -rrb- centers , and they have been devastated by what they saw , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poor treatment of immigrants has led to unrest in greece eu-wide problem greece 's geographical position at the very southeast of the eu makes it a magnet for migrants fleeing poor social or political conditions in their home countries .
most arrive through the land and sea borders with turkey .
while many irregular immigrants are arrested shortly after they enter greece , some manage to continue on to other eu countries , including germany .
the german government has sent many of these migrants back to greece , which both lueke and takis agree is wrong .
" -lrb- irregular migration -rrb- is not a special burden of greece , but a special burden of the whole eu , " takis said .
" and in this sense , greece receives very intense pressure of a problem which is not national , but a community problem . "
lueke , meanwhile , called on the german government to stop sending back irregular migrants and asylum seekers who first entered to greece , because " the german government must know that the conditions for asylum seekers in greece are miserable . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

but because the process is tedious , many find it hard to land gainful jobs . sixty-two year old ardit singh fled kabul in 1992 for delhi , after the fall of the moscow backed-government and soon after civil war erupted .
at that time , he says there were around 20,000 hindus and sikhs in afghanistan .
after the taliban took over in 1997 , there was a greater exodus , and today only a few hundred hindus and sikhs are left in afghanistan .
ardit singh says he has had a tough time getting indian citizenship .
to be eligible , a refugee must have lived in india for 12 years or have been married to an indian for seven years .
the length of stay must be supported by documentation – a residence permit issued by the indian government – for it to count towards naturalization .
" there are so many who are poor and many have not got citizenship , " says ardit singh .
" i applied for one in 2003 and applied personally .
i applied for four people in my family .
my daughter , son and i have got it but not my wife .
there are many cases like this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandahar is considered a stronghold of the taliban support from ngos many of the afghan sikhs who fled to india owned farm lands , vineyards , big houses and were a thriving business community in east afghanistan .
but now , hundreds of families find they can not even conduct a legitimate business because of their indeterminate status .
at a non-governmental organization set up in 1998 by sikhs from afghanistan , singh tries to help the poorer families .
" we have opened up the khalsa diwan for educating poor children .
we pay for their school fees through this organization .
the khalsa diwan is old , it was there also in afghanistan . "
the never ending wait the incredibly long process for citizenship deters many from applying .
once an application for naturalization is filed , the applicant is not allowed to leave india until the end of the process .
there are some families where the women have applied and the men have not , keeping open their option to return to afghanistan should the opportunity arise .
" the process is slightly long , " explains nayana bose from the un refugee agency unhcr .
" it takes on an average 2 to 3 years after the forms have been submitted because it has to go through various government authorities – at the delhi level , the district and central level and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many afghan hindus and sikhs are disappointed with the indian government desire to become indian assimilation to indian society is easier for the refugees .
there is a greater sense of identity being familiar with the language and culture .
narender singh , who fled kandahar after the taliban takeover , says many families have stayed afloat in india through sheer determination .
" our community has worked hard .
we are not scared of anything .
be it day or night , we can toil and take on any work .
we have been here for 18 years , i have not asked for alms .
but i am disappointed with the indian government . "
though many refugees still cherish memories of the famous dry fruits and the streets of kabul , most have decided to make india their home .
their only desire is to become indian citizens . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony .

a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .

" kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .

" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .

' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .

the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

the carrier expects membership to enlarge its route network , increase efficiency and consolidate its market postion against rival lufthansa . german low-cost airline air berlin is joining the oneworld alliance .
the agreement was officially approved on monday evening in berlin . full membership in the alliance is scheduled for the beginning of 2012 .
air berlin plans to begin cooperating with american airlines and finnair on november 1 , with 38 routes including nine transatlantic connections being offered under a code sharing agreement .
most of the destinations will be in europe and asia . " together with our partners we can offer a global route network in the future , " air berlin chief joachim hunold said during a press conference on tuesday . " central europe - and especially germany - was one of the areas where we wanted to expand , " willie walsh , ceo of british airways , added .
" this is real progress in the competition with the other alliances . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oneworld is the perfect match for air berlin , says ceo joachim hunold the other two alliances are star alliance , which includes germany ’ s biggest airline lufthansa , and skyteam , comprised of air france and klm .
oneworld 's member airlines include british airways , american airways and iberia .
all alliances involve close cooperation on flight plans , connections , frequent flyer programs and the airport lounge access . striving for expansion air berlin is the first discount carrier added to a major airline alliance .
it ’ s a logical step , says aviation analyst klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research : " they have the flight schedule , the structure , different kinds of planes and so on .
they have always been more of a regular airline than a low-cost carrier . " and , after all , air berlin has grown bigger and bigger over recent years .
in 2006 the company bought german carrier dba .
one year later it merged with ltu - allowing it to offer long-haul flights to san francisco , cape town and bangkok , for example . the first half of 2010 saw passenger numbers decrease due to the ash cloud created by eruptions of volcanic ash in iceland - as did all european airlines .
by june the company had recovered : air berlin carried 3.4 percent more passengers than in the same month last year .
and shares in the airline bounded ahead by more than 4 percent on tuesday after it announced its plan to join the alliance . bildunterschrift : the airline industry is confident it 's left the worst of the financial crisis behind it major league " air berlin has grown from a little charter airline to one of the leading carriers in europe , " hunold said on tuesday .
when it comes to passenger numbers , air berlin is now the fifth biggest airline in europe and the second biggest in germany . on a global level though , air berlin is not among the major players .
" it is about 15 percent of the size of lufthansa and also much smaller than british airways and air france , " analyst juergen pieper from metzler bank said .
in terms of size , passenger numbers and revenue air berlin ’ s competitor lufthansa is still way ahead of them . hence for pieper the move was a defensive necessity : " they had to join a bigger alliance with more powerful partners in order to survive long-term .
without this move air berlin would have had to face a difficult year and also a difficult future .
it looks more positive now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa and star alliance still enjoy a dominant position in europe a win-win situation the future looks brighter for oneworld as well .
air berlin 's membership allows the alliance to fill a gap in oneworld ’ s presence in europe .
so far its competitor star alliance had the upper hand on the german market .
" air berlin helps oneworld to get face-to-face with star alliance , " says analyst pieper , adding that competition will surely intensify . but : " there is no need for lufthansa - or the star alliance - to panic , " said aviation expert klaus-heiner roehl - especially considering many flights will probably go through london heathrow , as british airways is one of the anchor airlines of oneworld : " heathrow airport is not very popular for transfers .
changing from one plane to another is cumbersome and strenuous .
so some people might consider if that ’ s worth it . " author : monika griebeler editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .

russia backed last month 's un sanctions but condemned unilateral measures by the us and the eu . russia on tuesday criticized the decision by the eu to impose a fresh round of sanctions on iran .
using sanctions outside the un securtiy council framework was " unacceptable , " a foreign ministry statement released in moscow said .
" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

but human rights group amnesty international says these migrants are often abused by greek authorities . a report released by amnesty international on tuesday blasted greece for its treatment of irregular migrants and asylum seekers , saying the government often treats them as criminals and violates their human rights .
the report details several cases of asylum seekers and irregular migrants , or those without legal status , being held for long periods of time in cramped detention quarters while their cases awaited review .
" greece completely forgets that asylum is a right and not a crime , " monika lueke , general secretary of amnesty international in germany , told deutsche welle .
" if greece ignores the asylum regulation then greece can be taken not only to the european court of human rights , but also to the european court of justice for violation of european union law . "
according to the report , those detained often lacked access to clean water , medical treatment or legal representation , and that some cases involved unaccompanied minors .
in the report 's conclusion , amnesty calls on greek authorities to undertake a " comprehensive overhaul " of its legislation and policies relating to migration and to use detention only as a measure of last resort , as stipulated in european and international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lueke says germany needs to stop sending immigrants back to greece reform underway andreas takis , greece 's secretary-general of migration policy and former ombudsman on human rights , said that many incidents like those mentioned in amnesty 's report are true , and that they are " important and not pleasing at all to the greek administration . "
" to be sincere , this is not something different , it 's just kind of a repetition of very intense problems that the previous government , and the previous-previous government were also facing , " he said .
he added that the government was already in the process of reforming its asylum laws , and that it was considering moving authority over detention centers - many of which are on islands on the frontier - from local authorities to the federal police .
but lueke said that despite commitments from the government to reform the system , nothing has yet changed .
" our people have been to the -lrb- detention -rrb- centers , and they have been devastated by what they saw , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poor treatment of immigrants has led to unrest in greece eu-wide problem greece 's geographical position at the very southeast of the eu makes it a magnet for migrants fleeing poor social or political conditions in their home countries .
most arrive through the land and sea borders with turkey .
while many irregular immigrants are arrested shortly after they enter greece , some manage to continue on to other eu countries , including germany .
the german government has sent many of these migrants back to greece , which both lueke and takis agree is wrong .
" -lrb- irregular migration -rrb- is not a special burden of greece , but a special burden of the whole eu , " takis said .
" and in this sense , greece receives very intense pressure of a problem which is not national , but a community problem . "
lueke , meanwhile , called on the german government to stop sending back irregular migrants and asylum seekers who first entered to greece , because " the german government must know that the conditions for asylum seekers in greece are miserable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 27.07.2010 nuclear fusion reactor faces delays , budget woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iter could be the first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor iter involves a multinational effort to harness energy produced through nuclear fusion .
this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

but because the process is tedious , many find it hard to land gainful jobs . sixty-two year old ardit singh fled kabul in 1992 for delhi , after the fall of the moscow backed-government and soon after civil war erupted .
at that time , he says there were around 20,000 hindus and sikhs in afghanistan .
after the taliban took over in 1997 , there was a greater exodus , and today only a few hundred hindus and sikhs are left in afghanistan .
ardit singh says he has had a tough time getting indian citizenship .
to be eligible , a refugee must have lived in india for 12 years or have been married to an indian for seven years .
the length of stay must be supported by documentation – a residence permit issued by the indian government – for it to count towards naturalization .
" there are so many who are poor and many have not got citizenship , " says ardit singh .
" i applied for one in 2003 and applied personally .
i applied for four people in my family .
my daughter , son and i have got it but not my wife .
there are many cases like this . "

but now , hundreds of families find they can not even conduct a legitimate business because of their indeterminate status .
at a non-governmental organization set up in 1998 by sikhs from afghanistan , singh tries to help the poorer families .
" we have opened up the khalsa diwan for educating poor children .
we pay for their school fees through this organization .
the khalsa diwan is old , it was there also in afghanistan . "
the never ending wait the incredibly long process for citizenship deters many from applying .
once an application for naturalization is filed , the applicant is not allowed to leave india until the end of the process .
there are some families where the women have applied and the men have not , keeping open their option to return to afghanistan should the opportunity arise .
" the process is slightly long , " explains nayana bose from the un refugee agency unhcr .
" it takes on an average 2 to 3 years after the forms have been submitted because it has to go through various government authorities – at the delhi level , the district and central level and so on . "

we are not scared of anything .

but because the process is tedious , many find it hard to land gainful jobs . sixty-two year old ardit singh fled kabul in 1992 for delhi , after the fall of the moscow backed-government and soon after civil war erupted .
at that time , he says there were around 20,000 hindus and sikhs in afghanistan .
after the taliban took over in 1997 , there was a greater exodus , and today only a few hundred hindus and sikhs are left in afghanistan .
ardit singh says he has had a tough time getting indian citizenship .
to be eligible , a refugee must have lived in india for 12 years or have been married to an indian for seven years .
the length of stay must be supported by documentation – a residence permit issued by the indian government – for it to count towards naturalization .
" there are so many who are poor and many have not got citizenship , " says ardit singh .
" i applied for one in 2003 and applied personally .
i applied for four people in my family .
my daughter , son and i have got it but not my wife .
there are many cases like this . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandahar is considered a stronghold of the taliban support from ngos many of the afghan sikhs who fled to india owned farm lands , vineyards , big houses and were a thriving business community in east afghanistan .
but now , hundreds of families find they can not even conduct a legitimate business because of their indeterminate status .
at a non-governmental organization set up in 1998 by sikhs from afghanistan , singh tries to help the poorer families .
" we have opened up the khalsa diwan for educating poor children .
we pay for their school fees through this organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

but opposition could also come from at home , as public support for membership wanes . iceland is beginning formal accession talks with the european union on tuesday , following the approval of the bloc 's foreign ministers in brussels .
the eu ministers agreed a " negotiating framework " on monday , despite differences over such issues as whale hunting and the icelandic banking collapse that hit british and dutch investors in 2008 .
iceland is already a member of the schengen border-free travel zone and the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- , and hopes to join the bloc in about two years ' time .
" it is clear things might go smoothly on a certain number of subjects , " said steven vanackere , belgium 's foreign minister , following the meeting in brussels on monday .
however , iceland 's bid could face opposition from some eu countries .
" there are other chapters on which the eu knows efforts will have to be made by iceland .
think of ... the financial sector , " vanackere said .
the british and dutch governments want the prospective member to refund billions of euros they handed out in compensation to their own citizens who lost deposits as a result of the collapse of online bank icesave .
icelanders , however , rejected a payout plan in a referendum earlier this year , and further repayment talks have been unsuccessful .
though the issue will not formally be part of the eu accession talks , it could end up being a stumbling block to eventual membership .
fulfilment of efta rules is necessary to qualify for eu membership , and those rules require iceland to resolve its debt dispute .
public support down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icelanders were n't happy with how the government handled the economy iceland 's eu bid also faces challenges at home .
the country 's application for eu membership last year , following the collapse of its banking sector , won slim political support and icelanders will still have to support the decision in a referendum .
an opinion poll carried out in june by capacent gallup showed that nearly 60 percent of icelanders are in favor of the government withdrawing the country 's application , due in part to the banking issue .
only a quarter of those polled opposed such a move .
" you have to want to join europe , " said france 's eu minister , pierre lellouche .
" i do n't have the impression from the opinion polls that the icelanders themselves are very favorable : that 's the problem . "
" the whole idea of having public support for the operation is something which has been raised during -lsb- monday 's -rsb- meeting .
there needs to be public support from the people of iceland , " said belgium 's vanackere .
no special treatment despite hopes that talks might wrap up early and allow iceland to join by 2012 , ahead of turkey and candidate countries in the balkans , ministers said there would be no special treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's whaling industry may be shut down to meet eu regulations iceland will be subject to " exactly the same kind of scrutiny and seriousness as any other candidate , " said vanackere .
the process is expected to take at least 12 to 18 months , as the northern nation brings its laws in line with eu standards .
oessur skarphedinsson , iceland 's foreign minister , said he did n't expect the real negotiations to begin until the mid-2011 , when discussions on divisive issues such as fisheries , agriculture , financial services and the environment are expected to take place .
to join the eu , iceland may have to shut down its whale hunting industry and open up its lucrative fishing areas to eu member states , a point expected to be controversial .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .

" bp today announced that , by mutual agreement with the bp board , tony hayward is to step down as group chief executive with effect from october 1 , 2010 , " the company said in a statement . hayward has been strongly criticized for a series of public relations gaffes in his handling of what is now considered the worst environmental disaster in us history . " i believe that it is not possible for the company to move on in the united states with me remaining as the face to bp , " hayward told reporters on a conference call .
" so i think that for the good of bp , and particularly for the good of bp in the united states , it is right for me to step down .

bp was the largest british company by market capitalization at the time of the explosion , but has seen its market share plunge by about 36 percent since april .
hayward took over as chief executive of bp from lord browne in 2007 .

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony . " together with the relatives and the friends , as well as with the injured and all those involved we wish to mourn and try to find solace , " hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier hannelore kraft visited the scene on sunday the service will take place in duisburg 's protestant salvatorkirche church , with a large screen in an adjacent city square relaying the events inside .
a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .
" that is his decision , " she said , but went on to add , " in the end it will also be a matter of political responsibility . " kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate . " we are not yet in a position to determine what triggered the sequence of events , " a police spokeswoman said , adding , " it would be good if mr schaller did not lose himself in speculation . " safety plan was ' solid ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisburg mayor adolf sauerland is under fire over event planning mayor sauerland defended what he called a " solid " safety plan at a news conference on sunday .
when he visited the site of the tragedy to lay a wreath , he was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders .
he has also faced scathing criticism from several media outlets . the mayor resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right . a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily said that sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony . " together with the relatives and the friends , as well as with the injured and all those involved we wish to mourn and try to find solace , " hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier hannelore kraft visited the scene on sunday the service will take place in duisburg 's protestant salvatorkirche church , with a large screen in an adjacent city square relaying the events inside .
a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .
" that is his decision , " she said , but went on to add , " in the end it will also be a matter of political responsibility . " kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate .

he has also faced scathing criticism from several media outlets . the mayor resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right . a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily said that sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony . " together with the relatives and the friends , as well as with the injured and all those involved we wish to mourn and try to find solace , " hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier hannelore kraft visited the scene on sunday the service will take place in duisburg 's protestant salvatorkirche church , with a large screen in an adjacent city square relaying the events inside .
a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .
" that is his decision , " she said , but went on to add , " in the end it will also be a matter of political responsibility . " kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate .

he has also faced scathing criticism from several media outlets . the mayor resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right . a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily said that sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .

fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 27.07.2010 air berlin climbs into oneworld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready for expansion : air berlin air berlin is spreading its wings to join the oneworld alliance .
the carrier expects membership to enlarge its route network , increase efficiency and consolidate its market postion against rival lufthansa . german low-cost airline air berlin is joining the oneworld alliance .
the agreement was officially approved on monday evening in berlin . full membership in the alliance is scheduled for the beginning of 2012 .
air berlin plans to begin cooperating with american airlines and finnair on november 1 , with 38 routes including nine transatlantic connections being offered under a code sharing agreement .
most of the destinations will be in europe and asia . " together with our partners we can offer a global route network in the future , " air berlin chief joachim hunold said during a press conference on tuesday . " central europe - and especially germany - was one of the areas where we wanted to expand , " willie walsh , ceo of british airways , added .
" this is real progress in the competition with the other alliances . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oneworld is the perfect match for air berlin , says ceo joachim hunold the other two alliances are star alliance , which includes germany ’ s biggest airline lufthansa , and skyteam , comprised of air france and klm .
oneworld 's member airlines include british airways , american airways and iberia .
all alliances involve close cooperation on flight plans , connections , frequent flyer programs and the airport lounge access . striving for expansion air berlin is the first discount carrier added to a major airline alliance .
it ’ s a logical step , says aviation analyst klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research : " they have the flight schedule , the structure , different kinds of planes and so on .
they have always been more of a regular airline than a low-cost carrier . " and , after all , air berlin has grown bigger and bigger over recent years .
in 2006 the company bought german carrier dba .
one year later it merged with ltu - allowing it to offer long-haul flights to san francisco , cape town and bangkok , for example . the first half of 2010 saw passenger numbers decrease due to the ash cloud created by eruptions of volcanic ash in iceland - as did all european airlines .
by june the company had recovered : air berlin carried 3.4 percent more passengers than in the same month last year .
and shares in the airline bounded ahead by more than 4 percent on tuesday after it announced its plan to join the alliance . bildunterschrift : the airline industry is confident it 's left the worst of the financial crisis behind it major league " air berlin has grown from a little charter airline to one of the leading carriers in europe , " hunold said on tuesday .
when it comes to passenger numbers , air berlin is now the fifth biggest airline in europe and the second biggest in germany . on a global level though , air berlin is not among the major players .
" it is about 15 percent of the size of lufthansa and also much smaller than british airways and air france , " analyst juergen pieper from metzler bank said .
in terms of size , passenger numbers and revenue air berlin ’ s competitor lufthansa is still way ahead of them . hence for pieper the move was a defensive necessity : " they had to join a bigger alliance with more powerful partners in order to survive long-term .
without this move air berlin would have had to face a difficult year and also a difficult future .
it looks more positive now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa and star alliance still enjoy a dominant position in europe a win-win situation the future looks brighter for oneworld as well .
air berlin 's membership allows the alliance to fill a gap in oneworld ’ s presence in europe .
so far its competitor star alliance had the upper hand on the german market .
" air berlin helps oneworld to get face-to-face with star alliance , " says analyst pieper , adding that competition will surely intensify . but : " there is no need for lufthansa - or the star alliance - to panic , " said aviation expert klaus-heiner roehl - especially considering many flights will probably go through london heathrow , as british airways is one of the anchor airlines of oneworld : " heathrow airport is not very popular for transfers .
changing from one plane to another is cumbersome and strenuous .
so some people might consider if that ’ s worth it . " author : monika griebeler editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .

so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 27.07.2010 experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp is iter 's principal deputy director general an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power . today and tomorrow , officials from iter in cadarache , france , just north of marseille , are meeting to discuss the beginning of construction of the thermonuclear reactor , as well as its scope and cost .
the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

accusations over who is to blame are focusing on the organizers of the event . a 25-year-old woman died in hospital of her injuries early on wednesday , bringing the death toll from the love parade tragedy to 21 .
the young woman was injured during the mass panic that broke out in a tunnel at the entrance to the festival .
according to state prosecutors , the overall number of victims now stands at more than 500 injured and 21 dead . authorities are expected to release the findings of a first inquiry on wednesday afternoon . according to germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung daily , the report will at least partly blame the organizers for what happened , accusing them of allegedly deploying far less safety stewards than initially promised and ignoring recommendations to install video surveillance cameras at the entrance to the tunnel . memorial service next saturday a memorial service for victims of the love parade tunnel disaster is to be held on saturday , with german chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff expected to attend . the chancellor is interrupting her summer holiday to be present at the ceremony . " together with the relatives and the friends , as well as with the injured and all those involved we wish to mourn and try to find solace , " hannelore kraft , state premier of north rhine-westphalia , said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier hannelore kraft visited the scene on sunday the service will take place in duisburg 's protestant salvatorkirche church , with a large screen in an adjacent city square relaying the events inside .
a condolence book has been set up for mourners to sign . kraft , who visited the site of the tragedy on sunday , also announced that the results of investigations appeared to show that all of the victims had died as a result of crushed ribcages . it had previously been thought that some might have died from injuries caused by falling from a wall at the exit from the single tunnel that led to the site . speaking after a cabinet session , kraft said that her state government would push for cities to be given more support in organizing large events in the future .
she also promised that the state government would oversee a counseling network for those affected . political consequences kraft said responsibility should be taken for the tragedy at a political level .
the comment came after accusations that the mayor of duisburg adolf sauerland had ignored repeated warnings that the city was inappropriate for the staging of such a large festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a condolence book has been set up for mourners the state premier stopped short of calling for sauerland ’ s resignation .
" that is his decision , " she said , but went on to add , " in the end it will also be a matter of political responsibility . " kraft defended the police , who it has been alleged caused the crush by opening access gates . love parade boss rainer schaller on monday blamed the police for opening more gates at the festival entrance , allowing thousands to press into an access tunnel for the techno music event . police in cologne , who have taken over the investigation into the event , rejected schaller 's comments and said it was too early to speculate . " we are not yet in a position to determine what triggered the sequence of events , " a police spokeswoman said , adding , " it would be good if mr schaller did not lose himself in speculation . " safety plan was ' solid ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duisburg mayor adolf sauerland is under fire over event planning mayor sauerland defended what he called a " solid " safety plan at a news conference on sunday .
when he visited the site of the tragedy to lay a wreath , he was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders .
he has also faced scathing criticism from several media outlets . the mayor resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right . a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger daily said that sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

most of the destinations will be in europe and asia .

all alliances involve close cooperation on flight plans , connections , frequent flyer programs and the airport lounge access . striving for expansion air berlin is the first discount carrier added to a major airline alliance .
it ’ s a logical step , says aviation analyst klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research : " they have the flight schedule , the structure , different kinds of planes and so on .

" it is about 15 percent of the size of lufthansa and also much smaller than british airways and air france , " analyst juergen pieper from metzler bank said .
in terms of size , passenger numbers and revenue air berlin ’ s competitor lufthansa is still way ahead of them . hence for pieper the move was a defensive necessity : " they had to join a bigger alliance with more powerful partners in order to survive long-term .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 calls grow for more transparency on afghanistan after major leak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covert ops in afghanistan are dominating the german news after whistle-blowing website wikileaks published thousands of classified documents on afghanistan , the german opposition is asking why it did n't learn of the information in parliament first . opposition members from germany 's green party on tuesday turned their attention to a new aspect of the thousands of leaked documents on the afghan conflict released by the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' online portal .
the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

the carrier expects membership to enlarge its route network , increase efficiency and consolidate its market postion against rival lufthansa . german low-cost airline air berlin is joining the oneworld alliance .
the agreement was officially approved on monday evening in berlin . full membership in the alliance is scheduled for the beginning of 2012 .
air berlin plans to begin cooperating with american airlines and finnair on november 1 , with 38 routes including nine transatlantic connections being offered under a code sharing agreement .
most of the destinations will be in europe and asia . " together with our partners we can offer a global route network in the future , " air berlin chief joachim hunold said during a press conference on tuesday . " central europe - and especially germany - was one of the areas where we wanted to expand , " willie walsh , ceo of british airways , added .
" this is real progress in the competition with the other alliances . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oneworld is the perfect match for air berlin , says ceo joachim hunold the other two alliances are star alliance , which includes germany ’ s biggest airline lufthansa , and skyteam , comprised of air france and klm .
oneworld 's member airlines include british airways , american airways and iberia .
all alliances involve close cooperation on flight plans , connections , frequent flyer programs and the airport lounge access . striving for expansion air berlin is the first discount carrier added to a major airline alliance .
it ’ s a logical step , says aviation analyst klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research : " they have the flight schedule , the structure , different kinds of planes and so on .
they have always been more of a regular airline than a low-cost carrier . " and , after all , air berlin has grown bigger and bigger over recent years .
in 2006 the company bought german carrier dba .
one year later it merged with ltu - allowing it to offer long-haul flights to san francisco , cape town and bangkok , for example . the first half of 2010 saw passenger numbers decrease due to the ash cloud created by eruptions of volcanic ash in iceland - as did all european airlines .
by june the company had recovered : air berlin carried 3.4 percent more passengers than in the same month last year .
and shares in the airline bounded ahead by more than 4 percent on tuesday after it announced its plan to join the alliance . bildunterschrift : the airline industry is confident it 's left the worst of the financial crisis behind it major league " air berlin has grown from a little charter airline to one of the leading carriers in europe , " hunold said on tuesday .
when it comes to passenger numbers , air berlin is now the fifth biggest airline in europe and the second biggest in germany . on a global level though , air berlin is not among the major players .
" it is about 15 percent of the size of lufthansa and also much smaller than british airways and air france , " analyst juergen pieper from metzler bank said .
in terms of size , passenger numbers and revenue air berlin ’ s competitor lufthansa is still way ahead of them . hence for pieper the move was a defensive necessity : " they had to join a bigger alliance with more powerful partners in order to survive long-term .
without this move air berlin would have had to face a difficult year and also a difficult future .
it looks more positive now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa and star alliance still enjoy a dominant position in europe a win-win situation the future looks brighter for oneworld as well .
air berlin 's membership allows the alliance to fill a gap in oneworld ’ s presence in europe .
so far its competitor star alliance had the upper hand on the german market .
" air berlin helps oneworld to get face-to-face with star alliance , " says analyst pieper , adding that competition will surely intensify . but : " there is no need for lufthansa - or the star alliance - to panic , " said aviation expert klaus-heiner roehl - especially considering many flights will probably go through london heathrow , as british airways is one of the anchor airlines of oneworld : " heathrow airport is not very popular for transfers .
changing from one plane to another is cumbersome and strenuous .
so some people might consider if that ’ s worth it . " author : monika griebeler editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 calls grow for more transparency on afghanistan after major leak großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : covert ops in afghanistan are dominating the german news after whistle-blowing website wikileaks published thousands of classified documents on afghanistan , the german opposition is asking why it did n't learn of the information in parliament first . opposition members from germany 's green party on tuesday turned their attention to a new aspect of the thousands of leaked documents on the afghan conflict released by the whistle-blowing ' wikileaks ' online portal .
the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?

the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .

russia backed last month 's un sanctions but condemned unilateral measures by the us and the eu . russia on tuesday criticized the decision by the eu to impose a fresh round of sanctions on iran .
using sanctions outside the un securtiy council framework was " unacceptable , " a foreign ministry statement released in moscow said .
" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .

" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 27.07.2010 nuclear fusion reactor faces delays , budget woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iter could be the first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor iter involves a multinational effort to harness energy produced through nuclear fusion .
this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

the reactor is a very expensive science experiment , whose overall cost has ballooned to an estimated 15 billion euros .
the european union is funding about 45 percent of the reactor , which , if successful when it comes online in eight years , could be the world 's first energy-efficient nuclear fusion reactor .
all electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the world are fission , rather than fusion , reactors .
the project has many other international partners , including the united states , japan , south korea , russia , india and china .
scientists believe a fusion reactor may lead to cheaper and safer nuclear energy .
deutsche welle spoke with iter 's principal deputy director general , german nuclear physicist norbert holtkamp , who is responsible for the project 's construction .
deutsche welle : can you tell us what 's going to be happening at the meeting ?
norbert holtkamp : at the meeting , the different countries will reach a final agreement on what we call the inter-baseline -lrb- will be reached -rrb- .
the inter-baseline entails three central things : the scope , so what exactly we are building ; the schedule , meaning the time frame we build it in ; and the total costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a tokamak , blanket modules coat the inside of the chamber and directly face the hot plasma , like this one in the tore supra tokamak also in caradache , france can you give our audience a little bit of background on what the iter reactor is and what a tokamak is ?
the iter is a tokamak , and a tokamak is a magnetic confinement device .
what that means is big magnetic coils with very strong magnetic fields enclosing plasma .
through the plasma in the tokamak , one has to drive a very high current to heat up the plasma to 150 million degrees celsius , which is about ten times the temperature of the sun 's core .
at this temperature the nuclei start to fuse .
that 's why it 's called a fusion reactor .
in the fusion process , energy is released -lrb- which we can use -rrb- later on to produce electricity .
now how is this type of reactor different from the normal nuclear fission reactors we have here in europe already ?
this is a fusion process .
so what we do is with light atoms , isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium - and they are in a gas .
in this gas we drive the current and this drives the plasma .
fusion is a process where two nuclei melt together , and that releases energy in the form of very fast neutrons and helium .
in a fission reactor , the nuclei are broken up and that also releases energy .
i understand that this is an experimental reactor , so is it going to be producing energy ?
well , it will produce energy , but we wo n't use this energy and make electricity out of it .
the energy that we produce will be released into the atmosphere .
we wo n't be using this energy in any commercial way .
it 's supposed to produce 10 times as much energy as we put into the plasma .
that would be about 500 megawatts .
that 's quite a bit .
about enough to feed a medium-sized city .
where are you in the process of constructing this reactor ?
in 2006 , the iter agreement was signed and those members are the european commission , russia , china , india , south korea , japan , and the united states .
these are our partners .
since then we 've built up the organization and the design .
france , as the host country , is delivering the site , making sure the preparations are finished , including the roads and the harbor .
the design is pretty much complete at this point and we have 60 percent of the total value of iter under contract right now in the different countries that are delivering components to us .
the countries do n't give us money - they give us components , which is called " in-kind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iter will heat up the plasma to 150,000,000 degrees celsius - ten times higher the temperature of the sun 's core what will this reactor do that the more traditional fission reactors ca n't do ?
first of all , so far , the largest reactors , fusion reactors , that exist , one in the us , one in japan , one in europe , just has to use a q of one .
that means as much energy was produced as was put into the plasma .
and that 's only at 60 megawatts .
iter is the first fusion reactor that will produce much more energy than it uses .
that still is a step that needs to be proven and there are scientific and technical questions that need to be answered and will be answered through the construction and operation of iter .
the goal is no different than a fission reactor .
the goal is to make energy .
but fission reactors work today , we know that .
there are plenty of them , especially in france , on the grid .
fusion reactors do n't exist yet .
so this is an important step to take .
why does anybody want to do that ?
there 's a variety of reasons .
first of all , the fuel that is necessary is accessible almost everywhere in the world .
deuterium we can get from sea water , tritium is something that will be bred in the reactor itself .
the process itself can not go into a chain reaction .
it can not become uncontrolled by itself , very different from a fission reactor .
so it 's an intrinsically safe system .
and while it does produce radioactive waste , the waste has a half life of 100 to 200 years after which the material can be re-used again .
there are qualitative differences between a fusion and a fission reactor .
why is the half life so much less in a fusion reactor than a fission reactor ?
it has to do with the nuclear process .
this waste is produced from an indirect process in which the neutron that comes from the fusion reaction flies into the walls of the fusion device and makes a nuclear reaction there .
these nuclear reactions , indirectly , with the material that is selected specifically not to create longer waves , makes this material reactive .
but the material lifetime , or the half life is on the order of 100 to 200 years .
that 's different from a fission reaction , in which you have uranium , plutonium which is a high-z atom and when you break this up then you have isotopes that have a longer half life .
there has been some criticism , particularly from french groups like " sortir du nucleaire " that have called for more research into green energy rather than more nuclear energy .
how do you respond to this ?
some people think we should n't use nuclear power , any type of nuclear power .
i certainly disagree with that given the challenges we face , not only in europe , but worldwide .
after all , we in europe and japan and the united states , we might be able to have enough power .
but if you look on to some of the partners that we have , china , india , they have huge growth in the next coming 20 or 30 years if they want to sustain their economic growth .
today in china , every week or so , a big gigawatt coal-fired plant goes online .
and sure we can burn up all the coal , or we can do something else and we believe that iter can make a big contribution to this .
we see this as economically viable and technically doable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 27.07.2010 serbia says it will never recognize kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the eu 's member states have recognized kosovo serbia has passed a resolution that it will never recognize kosovo 's independence .
last week , the internatinal court of justice ruled the 2008 declaration of independence to be in accordance with international law . in an emergency session on monday , the serbian parliament adopted a resolution staring that serbia will never accept the secession of kosovo .
" serbia will never , explicitly or implicitly , recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of kosovo , " the text of the motion said .
" the parliament considers it necessary to - through peaceful negotiations - reach a lasting , sustainable and mutually accepted solution for kosovo , in accordance with serbia 's constitution . "
the motion passed easily , with 192 votes for and 26 against .
the resolution follows last week 's ruling by the international court of justice , which stated that kosovo violated no international law by declaring independence from serbia in 2008 .
seeking a solution during a 12-hour session , serbian president boris tadic told parliament that belgrade would never give up kosovo and that the region remained its southern province .
he said the resolution was an attempt to “ seek to offer a solution and not inflame the problem . ”
tadic insisted that serbia , which is hoping to join eu , " must the have best possible relations with big powers , because any other policy would lead serbia directly into a disaster , and its citizens straight into poverty . "
" it 's not the time for great patriotism ; it is time for great deeds , " he said .
tadic said serbia would submit the resolution to the united nations general assembly in september , in an attempt to prevent further international recognition of kosovo and to reclaim the territory .
to date , 69 countries , including the united states and most members of the european union , recognize kosovo 's independence .

the carrier expects membership to enlarge its route network , increase efficiency and consolidate its market postion against rival lufthansa . german low-cost airline air berlin is joining the oneworld alliance .
the agreement was officially approved on monday evening in berlin . full membership in the alliance is scheduled for the beginning of 2012 .
air berlin plans to begin cooperating with american airlines and finnair on november 1 , with 38 routes including nine transatlantic connections being offered under a code sharing agreement .
most of the destinations will be in europe and asia . " together with our partners we can offer a global route network in the future , " air berlin chief joachim hunold said during a press conference on tuesday . " central europe - and especially germany - was one of the areas where we wanted to expand , " willie walsh , ceo of british airways , added .
" this is real progress in the competition with the other alliances . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oneworld is the perfect match for air berlin , says ceo joachim hunold the other two alliances are star alliance , which includes germany ’ s biggest airline lufthansa , and skyteam , comprised of air france and klm .
oneworld 's member airlines include british airways , american airways and iberia .
all alliances involve close cooperation on flight plans , connections , frequent flyer programs and the airport lounge access . striving for expansion air berlin is the first discount carrier added to a major airline alliance .
it ’ s a logical step , says aviation analyst klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research : " they have the flight schedule , the structure , different kinds of planes and so on .
they have always been more of a regular airline than a low-cost carrier . " and , after all , air berlin has grown bigger and bigger over recent years .
in 2006 the company bought german carrier dba .
one year later it merged with ltu - allowing it to offer long-haul flights to san francisco , cape town and bangkok , for example . the first half of 2010 saw passenger numbers decrease due to the ash cloud created by eruptions of volcanic ash in iceland - as did all european airlines .
by june the company had recovered : air berlin carried 3.4 percent more passengers than in the same month last year .
and shares in the airline bounded ahead by more than 4 percent on tuesday after it announced its plan to join the alliance . bildunterschrift : the airline industry is confident it 's left the worst of the financial crisis behind it major league " air berlin has grown from a little charter airline to one of the leading carriers in europe , " hunold said on tuesday .
when it comes to passenger numbers , air berlin is now the fifth biggest airline in europe and the second biggest in germany . on a global level though , air berlin is not among the major players .
" it is about 15 percent of the size of lufthansa and also much smaller than british airways and air france , " analyst juergen pieper from metzler bank said .
in terms of size , passenger numbers and revenue air berlin ’ s competitor lufthansa is still way ahead of them . hence for pieper the move was a defensive necessity : " they had to join a bigger alliance with more powerful partners in order to survive long-term .
without this move air berlin would have had to face a difficult year and also a difficult future .
it looks more positive now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa and star alliance still enjoy a dominant position in europe a win-win situation the future looks brighter for oneworld as well .
air berlin 's membership allows the alliance to fill a gap in oneworld ’ s presence in europe .
so far its competitor star alliance had the upper hand on the german market .
" air berlin helps oneworld to get face-to-face with star alliance , " says analyst pieper , adding that competition will surely intensify . but : " there is no need for lufthansa - or the star alliance - to panic , " said aviation expert klaus-heiner roehl - especially considering many flights will probably go through london heathrow , as british airways is one of the anchor airlines of oneworld : " heathrow airport is not very popular for transfers .
changing from one plane to another is cumbersome and strenuous .
so some people might consider if that ’ s worth it . " author : monika griebeler editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia backed last month 's un sanctions but condemned unilateral measures by the us and the eu . russia on tuesday criticized the decision by the eu to impose a fresh round of sanctions on iran .
using sanctions outside the un securtiy council framework was " unacceptable , " a foreign ministry statement released in moscow said .
" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

dw-world.de experimental fusion nuclear reactor aims to be safer , more energy efficient an international consortium of scientists hopes the iter fusion reactor in france could usher in a new era of nuclear energy , although many are concerned about its rising costs and the prospect of more nuclear power .
-lrb- 27.07.2010 -rrb- bucking the trend , finland to build two new nuclear reactors finland 's parliament has overwhelmingly approved government plans to allow a consortium of national utility groups and a german partner to construct two more nuclear power plants in the country .
what 's good , what 's bad about nuclear power ?
in numerous countries , nuclear power is viewed as a risky , dangerous technology .
those in support of using nuclear energy praise its environmental and economic qualities .

russia backed last month 's un sanctions but condemned unilateral measures by the us and the eu . russia on tuesday criticized the decision by the eu to impose a fresh round of sanctions on iran .
using sanctions outside the un securtiy council framework was " unacceptable , " a foreign ministry statement released in moscow said .
" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

russia backed last month 's un sanctions but condemned unilateral measures by the us and the eu . russia on tuesday criticized the decision by the eu to impose a fresh round of sanctions on iran .
using sanctions outside the un securtiy council framework was " unacceptable , " a foreign ministry statement released in moscow said .
" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

this week , partner countries are meeting to push for progress amid massive cost overruns and project delays . for decades , physicists have eyed nuclear fusion as a new wellspring of safe and limitless energy .
the process involves the fusion of hydrogen to produce helium - and huge amounts of energy , reproducing the reactions that take place on the sun . in 2005 , the european union and japan , south korea , china , russia , india and the united states joined forces to test fusion as a real , workable source of power .
the iter project involves the construction of a massive experimental nuclear fusion reactor in southern france .
the device is designed with a huge , tire-shaped vacuum chamber that uses giant magnets to contain hydrogen and is heated to 150 million degrees celsius .
in its plasma state , hydrogen nuclei can fuse to create helium and energy .
the cost of the reactor was initially estimated at 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- - and expected to be finished in 2018 .
but keeping the project under budget and on schedule has become increasingly difficult .
according to new figures , the reactor would be ready for operation by 2026 , at the earliest .
and iter 's price tag stands to triple - from 5 billion to 15 billion euros .
the price of raw materials has skyrocketed - and building the reactor would require special steel and other metals .
" the initial planning for iter was strictly budgeted , " said hartmut zohm , a scientific fellow at the max-planck institute for plasma physics in garching , germany .
" and they realized the details are more complicated - and can cost a bit more . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fusion reactor would be ten times hotter than the sun 's core trouble at the top as a multinational project , iter has also faced management difficulties .
" one problem with iter is that it has seven partners all over the world - so it 's a pretty slow process , " zohm said .
moreover , each partner state is interested in using domestic industries to supply parts for the project - and that means several companies from different countries are producing the same components .
" when one partner does n't produce the same part and instead it comes from several partners and has to be put together - that 's inefficient and leads to additional costs , " he added .
iter 's new management should help streamline efforts to get the project off the ground .
germany 's federal minister of education and research annette schavan has defended the significance of iter but said the government ca n't afford to write it a blank check .
the eu is required to cover half of iter 's costs - and making up additional funding shortfalls means curtailing other research initiatives or tapping into unused portions of the budget .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cadarache , france , was chosen as the site of the iter experimental reactor a scientific breakthrough ensuring iter 's success would bring efforts to understand the science of fusion forward by leaps and bounds .
so far , experts have only succeeded in generating fusion bursts for shorter periods of time .
in november 1991 , physicists achieved an initial breakthrough in fusion research .
using the experimental reactor jet in the united kingdom , scientists conducted the first test to produce controlled fusion power .
the pulse lasted just two seconds - but it helped pave the way for future fusion research .
the iter project could buoy hopes for a new and inexhaustible source of energy through nuclear fusion .
" the idea is to show that it 's possible to produce energy on a large scale , " zohm said .
" iter would be the first device able to produce 10 times more energy than required to sustain plasma , " he added .
" it 's an acid test to see if reactors are suited for fusion . "
just a test critics says it 's important to remember that iter is , in fact , an experimental reactor - and far from a real prototype for a new kind of nuclear power plant .
" producing nuclear fusion is a big scientific challenge - it means controlling heat of 100 million degrees celsius . " said heinz smital , a nuclear physicist for greenpeace .
" from the scientific side , it 's certainly very exciting .
but it should n't be portrayed as if it 's going to contribute to the energy supply . "
smital advocates stopping work on iter .
meanwhile , many of iter 's detractors say the money used to fund the project would be better spent on proven renewable energy initiatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 27.07.2010 air berlin climbs into oneworld großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ready for expansion : air berlin air berlin is spreading its wings to join the oneworld alliance .
the carrier expects membership to enlarge its route network , increase efficiency and consolidate its market postion against rival lufthansa . german low-cost airline air berlin is joining the oneworld alliance .
the agreement was officially approved on monday evening in berlin . full membership in the alliance is scheduled for the beginning of 2012 .
air berlin plans to begin cooperating with american airlines and finnair on november 1 , with 38 routes including nine transatlantic connections being offered under a code sharing agreement .
most of the destinations will be in europe and asia . " together with our partners we can offer a global route network in the future , " air berlin chief joachim hunold said during a press conference on tuesday . " central europe - and especially germany - was one of the areas where we wanted to expand , " willie walsh , ceo of british airways , added .
" this is real progress in the competition with the other alliances . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oneworld is the perfect match for air berlin , says ceo joachim hunold the other two alliances are star alliance , which includes germany ’ s biggest airline lufthansa , and skyteam , comprised of air france and klm .
oneworld 's member airlines include british airways , american airways and iberia .
all alliances involve close cooperation on flight plans , connections , frequent flyer programs and the airport lounge access . striving for expansion air berlin is the first discount carrier added to a major airline alliance .
it ’ s a logical step , says aviation analyst klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research : " they have the flight schedule , the structure , different kinds of planes and so on .
they have always been more of a regular airline than a low-cost carrier . " and , after all , air berlin has grown bigger and bigger over recent years .
in 2006 the company bought german carrier dba .
one year later it merged with ltu - allowing it to offer long-haul flights to san francisco , cape town and bangkok , for example . the first half of 2010 saw passenger numbers decrease due to the ash cloud created by eruptions of volcanic ash in iceland - as did all european airlines .
by june the company had recovered : air berlin carried 3.4 percent more passengers than in the same month last year .
and shares in the airline bounded ahead by more than 4 percent on tuesday after it announced its plan to join the alliance . bildunterschrift : the airline industry is confident it 's left the worst of the financial crisis behind it major league " air berlin has grown from a little charter airline to one of the leading carriers in europe , " hunold said on tuesday .
when it comes to passenger numbers , air berlin is now the fifth biggest airline in europe and the second biggest in germany . on a global level though , air berlin is not among the major players .
" it is about 15 percent of the size of lufthansa and also much smaller than british airways and air france , " analyst juergen pieper from metzler bank said .
in terms of size , passenger numbers and revenue air berlin ’ s competitor lufthansa is still way ahead of them . hence for pieper the move was a defensive necessity : " they had to join a bigger alliance with more powerful partners in order to survive long-term .
without this move air berlin would have had to face a difficult year and also a difficult future .
it looks more positive now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa and star alliance still enjoy a dominant position in europe a win-win situation the future looks brighter for oneworld as well .
air berlin 's membership allows the alliance to fill a gap in oneworld ’ s presence in europe .
so far its competitor star alliance had the upper hand on the german market .
" air berlin helps oneworld to get face-to-face with star alliance , " says analyst pieper , adding that competition will surely intensify . but : " there is no need for lufthansa - or the star alliance - to panic , " said aviation expert klaus-heiner roehl - especially considering many flights will probably go through london heathrow , as british airways is one of the anchor airlines of oneworld : " heathrow airport is not very popular for transfers .
changing from one plane to another is cumbersome and strenuous .
so some people might consider if that ’ s worth it . " author : monika griebeler editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia backed last month 's un sanctions but condemned unilateral measures by the us and the eu . russia on tuesday criticized the decision by the eu to impose a fresh round of sanctions on iran .
using sanctions outside the un securtiy council framework was " unacceptable , " a foreign ministry statement released in moscow said .
" this not only undermines our joint efforts to seek a political and diplomatic settlement around iran 's nuclear program , but also shows disdain for the carefully calibrated and coordinated provisions of the un security council resolutions , " the statement continued .
russia has for long been at odds with europe and the us as to whether sanctions are the right path to deal with iran .
moscow supports the sanctions adopted by the un last month but is critical of unilateral measures by the us or the eu .
moscow aims for diplomatic solution at the heart of the controversy is the international community 's concerned over tehran 's nuclear program .
while iran claims it needs the technology merely for civilian purposes , the west is worried that the islamic republic is in fact trying to develop nuclear weapons . the eu on monday agreed on a set of sanctions targeting iran 's foreign trade , banking and energy sectors .
these mirror sanctions imposed by the us last month and go much further than un proposals .
" we regret to say that all the recent steps by the european union and the united states to build pressure on iran display their disdain for the principles of collaboration , " the russian statement said .
but the sanctions already have yielded some degree of success .
in a letter to the international atomic energy agency on monday , tehran has signalled it is prepared to resume negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.07.2010 opinion : leaked documents should generate new afghanistan debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the publication of 92,000 confidential military reports , details of the afghanistan war have become much clearer .
the leaked documents should generate a new , more honest debate says deutsche welle 's bernd riegert . if all the published documents released on the internet by wikileaks are really authentic , then they reveal five essential aspects of our knowledge on the war .
but one must first view them from the perspective that nobody really knows whether the announcements , secret service reports and combat assessments included in the documents have been revealed in their entirety and are 100 percent real .
wikileaks has admitted that the publication of the documents is an attempt to bring about a swift end to the war in afghanistan .
it is obvious that documents which give a more positive view of the actions of the international troops have been left out .
in fact , wikileaks made a decision not to publish a further 15,000 documents on the internet .
so what are the five essential aspects provided by the documents ?
the first is that the war against terrorists , the taliban and insurgents in afghanistan is going a lot worse for the us-led international alliance than has previously been revealed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd riegert secondly , the taliban are stronger and better equipped than previously accepted .
the third is that us special forces are sent out to hunt high-ranking taliban leaders and drug barons with orders to capture or kill .
fourthly , the afghan authorities , the police and the military are infiltrated to a much larger degree by incapable and corrupt officials than previously thought .
fifth and finally , the pakistani secret service is thought to be supporting the taliban .
these have all been suspected of being true for some time , but now - still bearing in mind the nature of the source - they have become frustrating realities .
for germany , the third largest contributor of troops to afghanistan , the internet revelations raise many important questions that can now , finally , be discussed openly .
how should the german armed forces react to the dangerous situation in the area around their base in kunduz and in the north of afghanistan ?
should the troops be withdrawn quickly or should they be strengthened by numbers and equipped with better weapons ?
should the federal government admit that its present strategy of using its civil construction policy to pacify the afghans has failed ?
should germany 's aims be narrowed down to the core task , namely to curb the taliban and terrorists ?
one can only hope that foreign minister guido westerwelle 's initial reaction of feigning ignorance was just that . he must now explain clearly to the german parliament that the idea of creating a stable and secure afghanistan by 2014 is an illusion .
if the german government wants to stand beside the united states -which contributes nearly 20 times as many troops as germany - and wants to further engage in a war which is aimed at destroying the taliban and terrorist groups , then it should commit to that and make its intentions clear .
german soldiers need a clear mandate based on international law , moral transparency and truth .
after the summer break , the bundestag is due to discuss the afghanistan strategy anew and will have to come up with a new mandate for the troops , if necessary .
trying to sugarcoat the stark reality on the ground is no longer possible after wikileaks ' exploits on the internet .
incidentally , the wikileaks documents also show that the air strike called in by german forces on hijacked fuel tankers which killed a number of civilians near kunduz in september was just one of hundreds of similar incidents .
this revelation sparked a huge amount of outrage in germany because it shows that civilians are reportedly killed in large numbers in such attacks .
in the larger context of a difficult war , such incidents are regrettably routine .
it is unfortunate of course if civilians die in this war .
it is also true , however , that far more afghans die through bomb attacks by the taliban and the insurgents .
to describe this war as being dirty is of course only right but it is also banal and naive .
is there such a thing as a clean war in which only the enemy is killed ?
that 's one reason why us special forces are secretly hunting and targeting the taliban and insurgent commanders in an attempt to limit the damage to avoid having to occupy and bomb huge swathes of afghanistan .
germany and the other contributing nations may soon come to realize that afghanistan can not be pacified .
but how realistic is the option to withdraw ?
would that not simply pave the way for yet another unpredictable , radical regime to grab power and provide terrorists with a safe haven ?
now is the time for a clear foreign policy stance from berlin and not the time for simply riding out the storm .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "

while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .

the presence of a us special forces unit called task force 373 in the north of afghanistan might be common knowledge in security circles , but the opposition say that they had had no idea what those troops were doing , until now . this , despite the fact that germany heads the regional command for the area .
" we kept hearing that the us had special forces in the north , that 's nothing new , " said greens defense spokesman omid nouripour in an interview on german public radio .
" but it was news to me that there were documents clearly describing what these troops have been doing .
and they were nato-access documents , which means the government must have known what they were doing too .
the problem is that they never told us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nouripour says he should n't learn about covert ops online nouripour speculates that either the government overlooked the pertinent data , or knew about it and decided to withhold it from the opposition , and says they look bad in either scenario .
yet the government says it is being transparent with sensitive information .
" we pass on everything we know to the opposition , or rather to all the relevant parties at government security meetings , " defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview on public television .
" but these things are kept largely secret for a good reason .
often it 's for the safety of our own people in the field .
all i can advise is that people try to stay awake and listen attentively in these meetings . "
' capture and kill ' task force 373 's roughly 300 operatives based at the german masar-i-sharif military camp carry out clandestine missions targeting high-profile taliban leaders in the region .
the information published on wikileaks suggests they are aggressive operations that even take into account the possibility of civilian casualties .
often termed " capture and kill " missions , they do n't really fit well with germany 's non-aggressive post-war military policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the third-largest contributor to the isaf mission " i have seen some files , where it was n't really a ' capture and kill ' mission , it was just a ' kill ' mission , " nouripour of the greens said , referring to the information he had read on wikileaks .
" the sole objective was to neutralize the target .
if that 's true , then we are in a complicated legal grey area , to put it mildly . "
ever since world war ii , the german army - the bundeswehr - has pledged to only operate abroad as part of a peacekeeping or rebuilding mission , or in self-defense .
given the country 's history , taking part in aggressive warfare is strictly forbidden .
also , bundeswehr soldiers are potentially liable in civilian courts for orders they carry out at the behest of their superiors , unlike in most militaries around the world .
task force 373 does not report directly to isaf 's german commanding officer in the north of afghanistan , taking their orders directly from the us instead .
but the unit 's mere presence in a primarily german-run area of the country - and the activities it carries out - might be enough to call the peacekeeping nature of the german mission into question .
" it 's also long been common knowledge -lrb- in berlin -rrb- that task force 373 pursues particular types of missions , " defense minister guttenberg said .
" the german bundeswehr 's area of responsibility is clearly demarcated from these activities .
we also regularly inform the opposition about this issue . "
afghan albatross bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg served as a soldier , and describes the afghan mission as a " war " the long , increasingly bloody german mission in afghanistan is becoming more and more of a liability for the government .
while the main opposition social democrat and green parties - who were ruling in coalition when germany joined the mission - tend to tone down criticism of an operation they also endorsed , the bundeswehr presence in afghanistan is extremely unpopular among the electorate .
the wikileaks allegations of a poorly prepared , under-equipped german military , and of ever more aggressive counter-insurgency measures taking place on german-patrolled soil are the last thing chancellor angela merkel 's government needs as it tries to sell the mission as unpleasant , but necessary for the country 's long-term security .
defense minister guttenberg caused quite a stir when he took office last year by openly talking about the afghan mission as a " war , " saying troops were in too much danger for the german peace-time military code to be truly applicable .
" all of us have been in positions of responsibility for some time , and probably have n't always addressed the reality of the situation , " guttenberg said on tuesday , arguing that most german politicians did n't want to accept the nature of the taliban insurgency .
" for whatever reasons , we all wanted to sugar the afghan pill a little .
and that had to change .
for this reason , many things in the media reports do n't really surprise me , but we 'll have to wait and soberly analyze exactly what is lurking in the 90,000 pages of information . "
guttenberg also said that it was impossible to ascertain whether the leaks posed a security threat before a more thorough analysis .
wikileaks says the information published is all at least seven months old , and therefore should not affect the current security landscape .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense . " dr. schmitz believes that while targeted aid is the best way of bypassing ineffective and corrupt government structures , trying to get assistance to those who really need it comes with its own set of problems . " the problem here is that those most in need of assistance are the uzbeks and this will put the uzbeks under even more pressure , " she said .
" it will be a real challenge to get the aid to the uzbeks without alienating the kyrgyz people and stirring the envy that was at the heart of the violence in june . " institutional inefficiency creating environment of instability many feel that this attention would be best directed at the government institutions whose parlous state and lack of power and control is said to have contributed to the kyrgyz military and police forces allegedly running amok in the wake of the violence . allegations of human rights abuses by kyrgyz security forces have been made by a number of ngos , including human rights watch and medicins sans frontiers .
as a result , the military and police remain deeply despised by many civilians , not just ethnic uzbeks .
any international mission will not only have to address the rule of law but the public 's faith in it . " our researchers on the ground in southern kyrgyzstan documented cases of arbitrary detention of ethnic uzbeks , very serious cases of torture and ill treatment of those arrested , and clear attempts to intimidate lawyers who represent ethnic uzbeks , " rachel denber , deputy director of the europe and central asia division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " this approach risks further destabilizing the situation , as the gap of alienation between the ethnic uzbek community and the authorities widens further , and tensions mount between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks . " bildunterschrift : experts say humanitarian and targeted aid must be sent to ease the suffering in kyrgyzstan " international assistance is badly needed to rebuild the country 's institutions and help the government ensure inter-ethnic harmony .
there should be transparency for how the aid is used and benchmarks for evaluating the success of the programs it is used for . " deep rooted , institutionalised problems hinder progress despite the clamor for international assistance , many experts believe that kyrgyzstan 's problems run too deep and that huge changes within its society and political structures are needed before it is stable enough for the rebuilding and financial efforts to have an effect . " kyrgyzstan is a long way from being a democratic country and meeting western requirements in terms of the protection of minorities , human rights and governance , " dr. schmitz said . " we can not expect any real stability anytime soon because not a single problem which caused the violence has been solved .
we may not see a return to widescale violence but as long as the kyrgyz community denies responsibility for what happened , there will be sporadic violence and harassment .

experts say institutional rebuilding is equally important . the emergency aid to the kyrgyz republic forum was attended by representatives of 50 international organizations including officials from the international monetary fund , world bank , asian development bank , european bank for reconstruction and development and united nations development program . the funds have been earmarked for economic reconstruction over the next 30 months .
out of that total around $ 600 million are being set aside for immediate aid until the end of the year . kyrgyz officials say the recent ethnic violence between members of the majority kyrgyz community and minority uzbeks , which plunged the southern regions of osh and jalalabad into chaos , caused some $ 1 billion worth of damage . official government figures state that around 2,500 homes , more than 100 commercial buildings , and 10 government buildings were either destroyed or suffered serious damage during the violent clashes in early june which claimed around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced . in addition to the structural and infrastructural rebuilding the country needs , the international community will also need to address factors which remain at the heart of the current instability ; the bitter rivallry between kyrgyz and uzbek communities , the widespread distrust of security forces and political institutions , and the effects of the reported human rights abuses inflicted on ethnic uzbeks during the violence . kyrgyzstan unfit to receive financial aid , say experts some observers have questioned the wisdom of pumping money into kyrgyzstan for reconstruction when the underlying sources for the ethnic violence remain and the institutions needed for the protection and implementation of the country 's new constitution are riddled with feuds and corruption . bildunterschrift : government buildings were ransacked but the institutions themselves are in an equally bad way " there is a real danger that any financial aid will not find its way to the recipients the donors have targeted for assistance , " dr. andrea schmitz , a russia and eurasia expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" kyrgyzstan is badly governed , there are no transparent policy makers and the necessary accountability for the financial aid can not be guaranteed . " " institutions and organizations like the eu should not go beyond offering humanitarian aid at this point because no-one really knows what 's going on in kyrgyzstan . " no time to waste as ethnic unrest continues to threaten asher pirt , a specialist on russian and central asian affairs at the british east west centre -lrb- bewc -rrb- , a london-based ngo which has a long track record in assisting human rights and legal reforms in the former soviet union region , agrees that institutionalized problems make targeted relief a better option than blanket financial aid but warns against delaying assistance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inefficient power structures could n't control the military and police as the ethnic violence spread " waiting to see what happens in the country is far too risky for the region and the rest of the world , " pirt told deutsche welle .
" this region is indeed strategic for europe and our greatest fear , that it could become another afghanistan , means we need to help now . " " kyrgyzstan needs expertise that will last and not fly home when the project finishes , " he added . " there needs to be a proper assessment of which bodies have the confidence of the people , and which do not , and why . i would suggest that smaller targeted activities almost always make more sense .
