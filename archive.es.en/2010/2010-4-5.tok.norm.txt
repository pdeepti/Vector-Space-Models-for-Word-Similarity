in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .

" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .

a loss for the ruling cdu-fdp coalition could mean trouble on the federal level . the crucial upcoming election in the german state of north rhine-westphalia is too close to call , according to a poll published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the poll , commissioned by surveying firm emnid , projects that in the election on may 9 , neither the ruling christian democrat-free democrat coalition nor a partnership between the social democrats and the greens will be able to land a majority .
according to the survey , premier juergen ruettgers and his christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- currently have 38 percent support , while the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- sit at eight percent .
the social democratic party has the support of 32 percent of voters , with the greens coming in at 12 percent .
the poll said the socialist left party , in the state 's political mix for the first time , currently has the support of seven percent of voters .
spd-greens-left coalition ?
the bild article noted that an spd-greens-left government could become a reality , though spd state leader hannelore kraft said her party would not consider such a coalition .
" the left party in nrw is neither ready to govern nor does it want to govern , " kraft told the bild am sonntag .
the outcome of the election could have significant effects on germany 's national political landscape .
if the current government is defeated , the ruling federal cdu-fdp coalition led by chancellor angela merkel could lose its majority in the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat. cmk / afp / apn / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .
it seems very likely that if the crackdown continues it will result in a higher rate of sexually-transmitted diseases . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "

" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "

stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .
harmonized eu system " there was not always motivation for a visa refusal there was no possibility to appeal against the visa refusal so that led to a lot of frustration of visa applicants and also led to the famous image of fortress europe , " de ceuster said .
starting next year , those whose visa applications are refused will be able to launch legal action in any of the 25 schengen countries .
for this reason , justice commissioner malmstroem called the new eu visa code an important step forward .
" this is the beginning of a fairer system for all individuals and thereby a fully-harmonized eu visa system , " she said .

a dutch frigate , part of the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission , recaptured the ship and arrested the pirates .
the crew were unharmed . dutch marines on monday intervened to free a german container ship that had been attacked by pirates earlier in the day .
the dutch defense ministry and the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta have both confirmed the rescue .
the " ms taipan " vessel was attacked roughly 500 nautical miles east of the coast of somalia while en route from the kenyan port city of mombasa to djibouti .
dutch sailors from the " tromp " frigate tried to negotiate a peaceful release , but when this failed they stormed the vessel and arrested 10 pirates .
dutch authorities reported that one of their sailors was injured in the fight , but none of the 15-strong crew were harmed .
evasive action once the " taipan 's " crew realized they could not evade the pirates , they followed atalanta 's protocols for a ship in distress and thus managed to avoid injury and secure their rescue .
they immobilized the vessel by turning off all engines and machinery , radioed the warships patrolling the gulf of aden to call for help , and then locked themselves away in a secure part of the ship to await rescue .
two of the 15 crew members were german .
the eu 's atalanta mission off somalia was launched in 2008 in response to a spike in pirate attacks on the key shipping lane .
the current fleet comprises 15 warships and three aircraft patrolling the region , with france the biggest single contributor to the mission. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a dutch frigate , part of the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission , recaptured the ship and arrested the pirates .
the crew were unharmed . dutch marines on monday intervened to free a german container ship that had been attacked by pirates earlier in the day .
the dutch defense ministry and the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta have both confirmed the rescue .
the " ms taipan " vessel was attacked roughly 500 nautical miles east of the coast of somalia while en route from the kenyan port city of mombasa to djibouti .
dutch sailors from the " tromp " frigate tried to negotiate a peaceful release , but when this failed they stormed the vessel and arrested 10 pirates .
dutch authorities reported that one of their sailors was injured in the fight , but none of the 15-strong crew were harmed .
evasive action once the " taipan 's " crew realized they could not evade the pirates , they followed atalanta 's protocols for a ship in distress and thus managed to avoid injury and secure their rescue .
they immobilized the vessel by turning off all engines and machinery , radioed the warships patrolling the gulf of aden to call for help , and then locked themselves away in a secure part of the ship to await rescue .
two of the 15 crew members were german .
the eu 's atalanta mission off somalia was launched in 2008 in response to a spike in pirate attacks on the key shipping lane .
the current fleet comprises 15 warships and three aircraft patrolling the region , with france the biggest single contributor to the mission. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 05.04.2010 thousands of easter marchers demand afghan withdrawal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's military involvement in afghanistan was under fire this year 's traditional " easter marches " in germany have focused on war , nuclear weaponry , and the country 's involvement in the afghan conflict .
tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .
it seems very likely that if the crackdown continues it will result in a higher rate of sexually-transmitted diseases . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .
harmonized eu system " there was not always motivation for a visa refusal there was no possibility to appeal against the visa refusal so that led to a lot of frustration of visa applicants and also led to the famous image of fortress europe , " de ceuster said .
starting next year , those whose visa applications are refused will be able to launch legal action in any of the 25 schengen countries .
for this reason , justice commissioner malmstroem called the new eu visa code an important step forward .
" this is the beginning of a fairer system for all individuals and thereby a fully-harmonized eu visa system , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 05.04.2010 second lufthansa pilots ' strike looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 're striking " was the message in february , and now a four-day pilots ' strike at german airline lufthansa may yet take place , despite frantic efforts to settle the dispute through arbitration .
according to lufthansa , the trade union cockpit does n't want to talk . germany 's biggest airline lufthansa and the trade union cockpit remain at loggerheads , as a second pilots ' strike looms .
" so far , we have not received any notification from vc -lsb- cockpit -rsb- calling off the strike , " lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told the news agency reuters on monday .
walther said in a separate interview that cockpit had rejected the airline 's calls for arbitration in a bid to avoid the strike .
a spokesman for cockpit , which represents roughly 4,000 pilots , told the dpa news agency that the union had no intention of retracting its strike unless lufthansa cedes some ground first .
" lufthansa wants something from us , " the spokesman said .
" they want to save their company from problems , so it 's up to them to make the first move .
if they do n't adjust their position , then we will definitely strike from april 13 . "
strike two the planned four-day strike action would be the second this year ; in february roughly 2,000 flights were cancelled , even though the pilots went back to work early after pressure from a labor judge in frankfurt .
lufthansa estimated the damages of this one-day strike at 48 million euros .
bildunterschrift : lufthansa fears more mass-cancellations if the strike goes ahead lufthansa has already stated it might sue the cockpit trade union for damages after the industrial action .
the major bone of contention is how wide-ranging talks on pay and conditions for lufthansa pilots should be .
lufthansa wants to exclusively discuss the internal situation amongst the airline 's core of roughly 4,500 pilots , and to discuss its sister companies - like budget airline german wings - and their impact on lufthansa pilots at a later date .
cockpit is calling for immediate measures to protect lufthansa from internal competition , as its own budget airline starts cutting into the main company 's market share .
lufthansa is unwilling to widen the discussion like this , fearing such a move might jeopardize its freedom in the marketplace .
cockpit says if its demands are not met , its pilots will renege on their agreement to a cost-cutting plan called " climb 2011 " and will return to their original demands of a 6.4 percent pay raise and improved working conditions. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to lufthansa , the trade union cockpit does n't want to talk . germany 's biggest airline lufthansa and the trade union cockpit remain at loggerheads , as a second pilots ' strike looms .
" so far , we have not received any notification from vc -lsb- cockpit -rsb- calling off the strike , " lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told the news agency reuters on monday .
walther said in a separate interview that cockpit had rejected the airline 's calls for arbitration in a bid to avoid the strike .
a spokesman for cockpit , which represents roughly 4,000 pilots , told the dpa news agency that the union had no intention of retracting its strike unless lufthansa cedes some ground first .
" lufthansa wants something from us , " the spokesman said .
" they want to save their company from problems , so it 's up to them to make the first move .
if they do n't adjust their position , then we will definitely strike from april 13 . "
strike two the planned four-day strike action would be the second this year ; in february roughly 2,000 flights were cancelled , even though the pilots went back to work early after pressure from a labor judge in frankfurt .
lufthansa estimated the damages of this one-day strike at 48 million euros .
bildunterschrift : lufthansa fears more mass-cancellations if the strike goes ahead lufthansa has already stated it might sue the cockpit trade union for damages after the industrial action .
the major bone of contention is how wide-ranging talks on pay and conditions for lufthansa pilots should be .
lufthansa wants to exclusively discuss the internal situation amongst the airline 's core of roughly 4,500 pilots , and to discuss its sister companies - like budget airline german wings - and their impact on lufthansa pilots at a later date .
cockpit is calling for immediate measures to protect lufthansa from internal competition , as its own budget airline starts cutting into the main company 's market share .
lufthansa is unwilling to widen the discussion like this , fearing such a move might jeopardize its freedom in the marketplace .
cockpit says if its demands are not met , its pilots will renege on their agreement to a cost-cutting plan called " climb 2011 " and will return to their original demands of a 6.4 percent pay raise and improved working conditions. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 05.04.2010 eu unveils improved schengen visa application system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty-five schengen nations , one visa application process around 10 million people each year receive a visa allowing entry to europe 's borderless schengen area .
regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .

regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .

in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .
planned policy changes at facebook could allow personal data to be passed on to third parties for commercial purposes without requiring the users to actively give their consent .

" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .

google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available in the us , britain , france and other countries - and google plans to extend its service to germany as well .

in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .
planned policy changes at facebook could allow personal data to be passed on to third parties for commercial purposes without requiring the users to actively give their consent .
facebook widely criticzed in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook founder mark zuckerberg got mail from berlin " anyone who wishes to not have their data passed on has to use the opt-out function , " aigner said .
facebook has been widely condemned for this , as the majority of users are expected to overlook the changes and will therefore unwittingly have their personal information used for commercial purposes .
" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .
one of those is ilse aigner herself , but should facebook stick to its current model , aigner said she would see no option but to cancel her account .
google also in the line of fire recently , aigner had also railed against internet giant google 's street view project - also on grounds of privacy protection .
google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available in the us , britain , france and other countries - and google plans to extend its service to germany as well .
aigner earlier this year had described the images on google as " a million-fold violation of privacy rights . "
" no secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " she said. ai / ap / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

a loss for the ruling cdu-fdp coalition could mean trouble on the federal level . the crucial upcoming election in the german state of north rhine-westphalia is too close to call , according to a poll published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the poll , commissioned by surveying firm emnid , projects that in the election on may 9 , neither the ruling christian democrat-free democrat coalition nor a partnership between the social democrats and the greens will be able to land a majority .
according to the survey , premier juergen ruettgers and his christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- currently have 38 percent support , while the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- sit at eight percent .
the social democratic party has the support of 32 percent of voters , with the greens coming in at 12 percent .
the poll said the socialist left party , in the state 's political mix for the first time , currently has the support of seven percent of voters .
spd-greens-left coalition ?
the bild article noted that an spd-greens-left government could become a reality , though spd state leader hannelore kraft said her party would not consider such a coalition .
" the left party in nrw is neither ready to govern nor does it want to govern , " kraft told the bild am sonntag .
the outcome of the election could have significant effects on germany 's national political landscape .
if the current government is defeated , the ruling federal cdu-fdp coalition led by chancellor angela merkel could lose its majority in the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat. cmk / afp / apn / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .
emerging markets were driving this at the beginning but developed markets are also now catching up , " nick kounis , economist at fortis bank in amsterdam , said last week .
part of a worldwide trend growth in europe is part of a worldwide upswing in manufacturing output .
bildunterschrift : german manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in 10 years in the united states , the manufacturing sector grew at the fastest rate in five years .
similar gains were made by countries throughout asia .
the manufacturing news is the latest in a string of positive economic signs that are sustaining hope that the world economy is beginning to experience sustained growth after the worst financial downturn in decades .
this hope has sent world financial markets to their highest levels in 18 months .
" we had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturing data around the world , " said matthew strauss , a senior currency strategist at rbc capital markets in toronto .
" the numbers were not out of the ballpark but were all stronger than expected , so that 's a good start to the month . "
doubts about strength of european recovery even with the positive manufacturing numbers , doubts about the sustainability of europe 's recovery persist .
although greece has held a series of successful bond auctions to raise money , it is still far from paying off its enormous debt .
also , eu consumer consumption has dragged in recent months , an indication that consumers are still reluctant to spend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is expected to keep interest rates low the european central bank is expected to keep interests rates low in the coming months in an attempt to promote borrowing and , in turn , spending .
" the recovery is still weak , and therefore the outlook for inflation remains low , " the international monetary fund said of europe 's recovery in its latest world economic outlook .
" it 's appropriate to keep interest rates exceptionally low and to act very slowly in abandoning quantitative measures and changing collateral requirements . " us officials optimistic , but see uneven recovery official reaction to the latest numbers from the european union was muted because of the easter holiday .
however , officials in the united states said the positive data was a sign that drastic steps taken in the immediate wake of the crisis such as large bailout packages for banks have worked and lead to a broader recovery .
former chairman of the us federal reserve alan , speaking on a us television show sunday , said , " there is momentum building up which is really just beginning and it 's got a way to go " and that the odds of a double dip recession are now very low .
yet , despite greenspan 's optimism , us treasury secretary timothy geithner acknowledged last week that positive economic numbers have failed to generate substantial numbers of new jobs and that the economic recovery has large benefitted large corporations .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .
harmonized eu system " there was not always motivation for a visa refusal there was no possibility to appeal against the visa refusal so that led to a lot of frustration of visa applicants and also led to the famous image of fortress europe , " de ceuster said .
starting next year , those whose visa applications are refused will be able to launch legal action in any of the 25 schengen countries .
for this reason , justice commissioner malmstroem called the new eu visa code an important step forward .
" this is the beginning of a fairer system for all individuals and thereby a fully-harmonized eu visa system , " she said .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 05.04.2010 polish builders see a boom in low-energy homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the low-energy house cost 20 percent more to build , but it saves in the long run five years ago it would have been difficult to find low-energy houses in poland .
but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .

" important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .
emerging markets were driving this at the beginning but developed markets are also now catching up , " nick kounis , economist at fortis bank in amsterdam , said last week .
part of a worldwide trend growth in europe is part of a worldwide upswing in manufacturing output .
bildunterschrift : german manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in 10 years in the united states , the manufacturing sector grew at the fastest rate in five years .
similar gains were made by countries throughout asia .
the manufacturing news is the latest in a string of positive economic signs that are sustaining hope that the world economy is beginning to experience sustained growth after the worst financial downturn in decades .
this hope has sent world financial markets to their highest levels in 18 months .
" we had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturing data around the world , " said matthew strauss , a senior currency strategist at rbc capital markets in toronto .
" the numbers were not out of the ballpark but were all stronger than expected , so that 's a good start to the month . "
doubts about strength of european recovery even with the positive manufacturing numbers , doubts about the sustainability of europe 's recovery persist .
although greece has held a series of successful bond auctions to raise money , it is still far from paying off its enormous debt .
also , eu consumer consumption has dragged in recent months , an indication that consumers are still reluctant to spend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is expected to keep interest rates low the european central bank is expected to keep interests rates low in the coming months in an attempt to promote borrowing and , in turn , spending .
" the recovery is still weak , and therefore the outlook for inflation remains low , " the international monetary fund said of europe 's recovery in its latest world economic outlook .
" it 's appropriate to keep interest rates exceptionally low and to act very slowly in abandoning quantitative measures and changing collateral requirements . " us officials optimistic , but see uneven recovery official reaction to the latest numbers from the european union was muted because of the easter holiday .
however , officials in the united states said the positive data was a sign that drastic steps taken in the immediate wake of the crisis such as large bailout packages for banks have worked and lead to a broader recovery .
former chairman of the us federal reserve alan , speaking on a us television show sunday , said , " there is momentum building up which is really just beginning and it 's got a way to go " and that the odds of a double dip recession are now very low .
yet , despite greenspan 's optimism , us treasury secretary timothy geithner acknowledged last week that positive economic numbers have failed to generate substantial numbers of new jobs and that the economic recovery has large benefitted large corporations .
he called the recovery to this point " deeply unfair . " df / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .
harmonized eu system " there was not always motivation for a visa refusal there was no possibility to appeal against the visa refusal so that led to a lot of frustration of visa applicants and also led to the famous image of fortress europe , " de ceuster said .
starting next year , those whose visa applications are refused will be able to launch legal action in any of the 25 schengen countries .
for this reason , justice commissioner malmstroem called the new eu visa code an important step forward .
" this is the beginning of a fairer system for all individuals and thereby a fully-harmonized eu visa system , " she said .

a loss for the ruling cdu-fdp coalition could mean trouble on the federal level . the crucial upcoming election in the german state of north rhine-westphalia is too close to call , according to a poll published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the poll , commissioned by surveying firm emnid , projects that in the election on may 9 , neither the ruling christian democrat-free democrat coalition nor a partnership between the social democrats and the greens will be able to land a majority .
according to the survey , premier juergen ruettgers and his christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- currently have 38 percent support , while the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- sit at eight percent .
the social democratic party has the support of 32 percent of voters , with the greens coming in at 12 percent .
the poll said the socialist left party , in the state 's political mix for the first time , currently has the support of seven percent of voters .
spd-greens-left coalition ?
the bild article noted that an spd-greens-left government could become a reality , though spd state leader hannelore kraft said her party would not consider such a coalition .
" the left party in nrw is neither ready to govern nor does it want to govern , " kraft told the bild am sonntag .
the outcome of the election could have significant effects on germany 's national political landscape .
if the current government is defeated , the ruling federal cdu-fdp coalition led by chancellor angela merkel could lose its majority in the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat. cmk / afp / apn / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .
emerging markets were driving this at the beginning but developed markets are also now catching up , " nick kounis , economist at fortis bank in amsterdam , said last week .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 05.04.2010 ukraine scraps nato accession plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining nato is off the table , current ties are ' sufficient ' the ukrainian president has dissolved the commission which was to work towards nato membership .
it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .
emerging markets were driving this at the beginning but developed markets are also now catching up , " nick kounis , economist at fortis bank in amsterdam , said last week .
part of a worldwide trend growth in europe is part of a worldwide upswing in manufacturing output .
bildunterschrift : german manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in 10 years in the united states , the manufacturing sector grew at the fastest rate in five years .
similar gains were made by countries throughout asia .
the manufacturing news is the latest in a string of positive economic signs that are sustaining hope that the world economy is beginning to experience sustained growth after the worst financial downturn in decades .
this hope has sent world financial markets to their highest levels in 18 months .
" we had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturing data around the world , " said matthew strauss , a senior currency strategist at rbc capital markets in toronto .
" the numbers were not out of the ballpark but were all stronger than expected , so that 's a good start to the month . "
doubts about strength of european recovery even with the positive manufacturing numbers , doubts about the sustainability of europe 's recovery persist .
although greece has held a series of successful bond auctions to raise money , it is still far from paying off its enormous debt .
also , eu consumer consumption has dragged in recent months , an indication that consumers are still reluctant to spend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is expected to keep interest rates low the european central bank is expected to keep interests rates low in the coming months in an attempt to promote borrowing and , in turn , spending .
" the recovery is still weak , and therefore the outlook for inflation remains low , " the international monetary fund said of europe 's recovery in its latest world economic outlook .
" it 's appropriate to keep interest rates exceptionally low and to act very slowly in abandoning quantitative measures and changing collateral requirements . " us officials optimistic , but see uneven recovery official reaction to the latest numbers from the european union was muted because of the easter holiday .
however , officials in the united states said the positive data was a sign that drastic steps taken in the immediate wake of the crisis such as large bailout packages for banks have worked and lead to a broader recovery .
former chairman of the us federal reserve alan , speaking on a us television show sunday , said , " there is momentum building up which is really just beginning and it 's got a way to go " and that the odds of a double dip recession are now very low .
yet , despite greenspan 's optimism , us treasury secretary timothy geithner acknowledged last week that positive economic numbers have failed to generate substantial numbers of new jobs and that the economic recovery has large benefitted large corporations .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .
emerging markets were driving this at the beginning but developed markets are also now catching up , " nick kounis , economist at fortis bank in amsterdam , said last week .

bildunterschrift : german manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in 10 years in the united states , the manufacturing sector grew at the fastest rate in five years .

the manufacturing news is the latest in a string of positive economic signs that are sustaining hope that the world economy is beginning to experience sustained growth after the worst financial downturn in decades .
this hope has sent world financial markets to their highest levels in 18 months .
" we had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturing data around the world , " said matthew strauss , a senior currency strategist at rbc capital markets in toronto .
" the numbers were not out of the ballpark but were all stronger than expected , so that 's a good start to the month . "
doubts about strength of european recovery even with the positive manufacturing numbers , doubts about the sustainability of europe 's recovery persist .
although greece has held a series of successful bond auctions to raise money , it is still far from paying off its enormous debt .
also , eu consumer consumption has dragged in recent months , an indication that consumers are still reluctant to spend .

in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .
planned policy changes at facebook could allow personal data to be passed on to third parties for commercial purposes without requiring the users to actively give their consent .
facebook widely criticzed in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook founder mark zuckerberg got mail from berlin " anyone who wishes to not have their data passed on has to use the opt-out function , " aigner said .
facebook has been widely condemned for this , as the majority of users are expected to overlook the changes and will therefore unwittingly have their personal information used for commercial purposes .
" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .
one of those is ilse aigner herself , but should facebook stick to its current model , aigner said she would see no option but to cancel her account .
google also in the line of fire recently , aigner had also railed against internet giant google 's street view project - also on grounds of privacy protection .
google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available in the us , britain , france and other countries - and google plans to extend its service to germany as well .
aigner earlier this year had described the images on google as " a million-fold violation of privacy rights . "
" no secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " she said. ai / ap / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a dutch frigate , part of the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission , recaptured the ship and arrested the pirates .
the crew were unharmed . dutch marines on monday intervened to free a german container ship that had been attacked by pirates earlier in the day .
the dutch defense ministry and the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta have both confirmed the rescue .
the " ms taipan " vessel was attacked roughly 500 nautical miles east of the coast of somalia while en route from the kenyan port city of mombasa to djibouti .
dutch sailors from the " tromp " frigate tried to negotiate a peaceful release , but when this failed they stormed the vessel and arrested 10 pirates .
dutch authorities reported that one of their sailors was injured in the fight , but none of the 15-strong crew were harmed .
evasive action once the " taipan 's " crew realized they could not evade the pirates , they followed atalanta 's protocols for a ship in distress and thus managed to avoid injury and secure their rescue .
they immobilized the vessel by turning off all engines and machinery , radioed the warships patrolling the gulf of aden to call for help , and then locked themselves away in a secure part of the ship to await rescue .
two of the 15 crew members were german .
the eu 's atalanta mission off somalia was launched in 2008 in response to a spike in pirate attacks on the key shipping lane .
the current fleet comprises 15 warships and three aircraft patrolling the region , with france the biggest single contributor to the mission. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .
planned policy changes at facebook could allow personal data to be passed on to third parties for commercial purposes without requiring the users to actively give their consent .
facebook widely criticzed in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook founder mark zuckerberg got mail from berlin " anyone who wishes to not have their data passed on has to use the opt-out function , " aigner said .
facebook has been widely condemned for this , as the majority of users are expected to overlook the changes and will therefore unwittingly have their personal information used for commercial purposes .
" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .
one of those is ilse aigner herself , but should facebook stick to its current model , aigner said she would see no option but to cancel her account .
google also in the line of fire recently , aigner had also railed against internet giant google 's street view project - also on grounds of privacy protection .
google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available in the us , britain , france and other countries - and google plans to extend its service to germany as well .
aigner earlier this year had described the images on google as " a million-fold violation of privacy rights . "
" no secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " she said. ai / ap / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .
it seems very likely that if the crackdown continues it will result in a higher rate of sexually-transmitted diseases . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 05.04.2010 eu unveils improved schengen visa application system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty-five schengen nations , one visa application process around 10 million people each year receive a visa allowing entry to europe 's borderless schengen area .
regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .
harmonized eu system " there was not always motivation for a visa refusal there was no possibility to appeal against the visa refusal so that led to a lot of frustration of visa applicants and also led to the famous image of fortress europe , " de ceuster said .
starting next year , those whose visa applications are refused will be able to launch legal action in any of the 25 schengen countries .
for this reason , justice commissioner malmstroem called the new eu visa code an important step forward .
" this is the beginning of a fairer system for all individuals and thereby a fully-harmonized eu visa system , " she said .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .
it seems very likely that if the crackdown continues it will result in a higher rate of sexually-transmitted diseases . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .

this hope has sent world financial markets to their highest levels in 18 months .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .

over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 05.04.2010 ukraine scraps nato accession plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining nato is off the table , current ties are ' sufficient ' the ukrainian president has dissolved the commission which was to work towards nato membership .
it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 05.04.2010 second lufthansa pilots ' strike looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 're striking " was the message in february , and now a four-day pilots ' strike at german airline lufthansa may yet take place , despite frantic efforts to settle the dispute through arbitration .
according to lufthansa , the trade union cockpit does n't want to talk . germany 's biggest airline lufthansa and the trade union cockpit remain at loggerheads , as a second pilots ' strike looms .
" so far , we have not received any notification from vc -lsb- cockpit -rsb- calling off the strike , " lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told the news agency reuters on monday .
walther said in a separate interview that cockpit had rejected the airline 's calls for arbitration in a bid to avoid the strike .
a spokesman for cockpit , which represents roughly 4,000 pilots , told the dpa news agency that the union had no intention of retracting its strike unless lufthansa cedes some ground first .
" lufthansa wants something from us , " the spokesman said .
" they want to save their company from problems , so it 's up to them to make the first move .
if they do n't adjust their position , then we will definitely strike from april 13 . "
strike two the planned four-day strike action would be the second this year ; in february roughly 2,000 flights were cancelled , even though the pilots went back to work early after pressure from a labor judge in frankfurt .
lufthansa estimated the damages of this one-day strike at 48 million euros .
bildunterschrift : lufthansa fears more mass-cancellations if the strike goes ahead lufthansa has already stated it might sue the cockpit trade union for damages after the industrial action .
the major bone of contention is how wide-ranging talks on pay and conditions for lufthansa pilots should be .
lufthansa wants to exclusively discuss the internal situation amongst the airline 's core of roughly 4,500 pilots , and to discuss its sister companies - like budget airline german wings - and their impact on lufthansa pilots at a later date .
cockpit is calling for immediate measures to protect lufthansa from internal competition , as its own budget airline starts cutting into the main company 's market share .
lufthansa is unwilling to widen the discussion like this , fearing such a move might jeopardize its freedom in the marketplace .
cockpit says if its demands are not met , its pilots will renege on their agreement to a cost-cutting plan called " climb 2011 " and will return to their original demands of a 6.4 percent pay raise and improved working conditions. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a dutch frigate , part of the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission , recaptured the ship and arrested the pirates .
the crew were unharmed . dutch marines on monday intervened to free a german container ship that had been attacked by pirates earlier in the day .
the dutch defense ministry and the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta have both confirmed the rescue .
the " ms taipan " vessel was attacked roughly 500 nautical miles east of the coast of somalia while en route from the kenyan port city of mombasa to djibouti .
dutch sailors from the " tromp " frigate tried to negotiate a peaceful release , but when this failed they stormed the vessel and arrested 10 pirates .
dutch authorities reported that one of their sailors was injured in the fight , but none of the 15-strong crew were harmed .
evasive action once the " taipan 's " crew realized they could not evade the pirates , they followed atalanta 's protocols for a ship in distress and thus managed to avoid injury and secure their rescue .
they immobilized the vessel by turning off all engines and machinery , radioed the warships patrolling the gulf of aden to call for help , and then locked themselves away in a secure part of the ship to await rescue .
two of the 15 crew members were german .
the eu 's atalanta mission off somalia was launched in 2008 in response to a spike in pirate attacks on the key shipping lane .
the current fleet comprises 15 warships and three aircraft patrolling the region , with france the biggest single contributor to the mission. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .
this year , the main theme of the marches has been the conflict in afghanistan and the death of german and afghan soldiers there. rb / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

an investigation has been launched into friday 's friendly fire incident . german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on sunday the start of a thorough investigation into a friendly fire incident that left six afghan soldiers dead .
guttenberg told journalists that the office of the german prosecutor general had already started an investigation into friday 's friendly fire incident .
he said that in addition , his own ministry and the afghan defense ministry would also investigate the circumstances leading to the afghan soldiers ' death .
the incident occurred on the same day three german soldiers died and eight were wounded in heavy fighting with insurgents near the northern city of kunduz , where german soldiers are based .
guttenberg : situation could be called war guttenberg also stressed germany 's commitment to making afghanistan safe .
" our soldiers are n't there for nothing , " he said .
however , he said that in colloquial terms , the situation faced by german soldiers in afghanistan could be called a war .
the remarks reflect calls by foreign minister guido westerwelle and some others to reclassify the german mission in afghanistan as " armed conflict . "
so far , german military forces have been subjected to the civil penal code , given their participation in training afghan police and soldiers and in reconstruction activities .
bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany guttenberg 's comments come amid mounting calls by peace activists to pull bundeswehr troops out of afghanistan .
the mission is widely unpopular among the german population .
berlin currently has around 4,500 troops deployed in afghanistan , working alongside soldiers from other countries under nato command to check insurgents in the country .
most of the german forces are in northern afghanistan , which is regarded as relatively peaceful compared to other areas of the country .
however , kunduz has seen an increase in attacks by taliban and other insurgent groups in recent months .
mistaken identity ?
describing friday 's attack on the german troops , the head of the german armed forces general volker wieker told a news conference that a patrol was ambushed with gunfire and rockets by two groups of taliban fighters .
a german armored vehicle also struck a mine , he said .
the fighting that followed lasted around 10 hours , wieker said , adding that nato air support was called in but was unable to attack for fear of striking german soldiers or civilians .
three soldiers were killed and eight injured , the general said .
four soldiers wounded in the firefight have returned to germany and are said to be in stable condition .
the general said a german unit sent to reinforce the soldiers under attack had opened fire on two civilian vehicles which had not heeded calls to stop .
he said six afghan soldiers in one of the vehicles were killed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks have been on the rise in kunduz province sympathy and condolences guttenberg expressed his condolences to the families of the six afghan soldiers and the three german troops killed near kunduz .
chancellor angela merkel also expressed her sympathy in a telephone conversation with afghan president hamid karzai late on saturday .
german troops in afghanistan paid their last respects to the fallen soldiers at a ceremony held at the german field camp in kunduz .
german development minister dirk niebel , who was in afghanistan when the attack occurred , also attended the ceremony .
meanwhile , peace activists in germany have taken to the streets across the country in traditional easter rallies against war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 05.04.2010 eu unveils improved schengen visa application system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twenty-five schengen nations , one visa application process around 10 million people each year receive a visa allowing entry to europe 's borderless schengen area .
regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long lines and complicated forms should be a thing of the past all this is meant to change now .
the new system sets a deadline of two weeks for an applicant to be interviewed at a consulate .
the officials then have to decide within 15 calendar days whether or not the visa will be granted .
if the candidate is refused , a reason must be given .
harmonized eu system " there was not always motivation for a visa refusal there was no possibility to appeal against the visa refusal so that led to a lot of frustration of visa applicants and also led to the famous image of fortress europe , " de ceuster said .
starting next year , those whose visa applications are refused will be able to launch legal action in any of the 25 schengen countries .
for this reason , justice commissioner malmstroem called the new eu visa code an important step forward .
" this is the beginning of a fairer system for all individuals and thereby a fully-harmonized eu visa system , " she said .

regulations that came into force on april 5 should streamline the process of applying for a schengen visa . the european union says it has saved those seeking entrance to the bloc the hassle of long lines and difficult forms to fill out at consulates , as it has streamlined the schengen visa application process .
until now , each of the 25 member states that belong to the schengen area - a european zone in which the borders are completely open between neighbouring countries - had their own procedure for issuing visas to foreign tourists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new system was a long time coming , said malmstroem now , according to the european justice commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , the eu has created one system that will be implemented throughout the zone .
" the aim of the new eu visa code is to coordinate the practices in all the schengen countries , making it easier for the millions of applicants all over the world asking for a schengen visa , " malmstroem told deutsche welle . '
sorely needed ' the european commission said the new system was also meant to be more transparent and precise , and even a little cheaper .
while the standard fee for a visa of up to 90 days remains at 60 euros -lrb- $ 81 -rrb- , visas for children between the ages of six and 12 will cost only 35 euros .
the same goes for citizens of countries that have visa facilitation deals with the european union .
another positive aspect of the new visa code system is that the application form itself has been revised and significantly shortened .
jan de ceuster , head of the european commission 's visa issuance department , said the changes were sorely needed .
" i think we should admit that in the past sometimes the visa process was not always customer-friendly .
there were very long waiting lines ; sometimes you had to wait for two months before you could apply for your visa , " de ceuster told deutsche welle .

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .

doubts about strength of european recovery even with the positive manufacturing numbers , doubts about the sustainability of europe 's recovery persist .
although greece has held a series of successful bond auctions to raise money , it is still far from paying off its enormous debt .
also , eu consumer consumption has dragged in recent months , an indication that consumers are still reluctant to spend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is expected to keep interest rates low the european central bank is expected to keep interests rates low in the coming months in an attempt to promote borrowing and , in turn , spending .
" the recovery is still weak , and therefore the outlook for inflation remains low , " the international monetary fund said of europe 's recovery in its latest world economic outlook .
" it 's appropriate to keep interest rates exceptionally low and to act very slowly in abandoning quantitative measures and changing collateral requirements . " us officials optimistic , but see uneven recovery official reaction to the latest numbers from the european union was muted because of the easter holiday .
however , officials in the united states said the positive data was a sign that drastic steps taken in the immediate wake of the crisis such as large bailout packages for banks have worked and lead to a broader recovery .
former chairman of the us federal reserve alan , speaking on a us television show sunday , said , " there is momentum building up which is really just beginning and it 's got a way to go " and that the odds of a double dip recession are now very low .
yet , despite greenspan 's optimism , us treasury secretary timothy geithner acknowledged last week that positive economic numbers have failed to generate substantial numbers of new jobs and that the economic recovery has large benefitted large corporations .
he called the recovery to this point " deeply unfair . " df / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

according to lufthansa , the trade union cockpit does n't want to talk . germany 's biggest airline lufthansa and the trade union cockpit remain at loggerheads , as a second pilots ' strike looms .
" so far , we have not received any notification from vc -lsb- cockpit -rsb- calling off the strike , " lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told the news agency reuters on monday .
walther said in a separate interview that cockpit had rejected the airline 's calls for arbitration in a bid to avoid the strike .
a spokesman for cockpit , which represents roughly 4,000 pilots , told the dpa news agency that the union had no intention of retracting its strike unless lufthansa cedes some ground first .
" lufthansa wants something from us , " the spokesman said .
" they want to save their company from problems , so it 's up to them to make the first move .

lufthansa wants to exclusively discuss the internal situation amongst the airline 's core of roughly 4,500 pilots , and to discuss its sister companies - like budget airline german wings - and their impact on lufthansa pilots at a later date .
cockpit is calling for immediate measures to protect lufthansa from internal competition , as its own budget airline starts cutting into the main company 's market share .
lufthansa is unwilling to widen the discussion like this , fearing such a move might jeopardize its freedom in the marketplace .
cockpit says if its demands are not met , its pilots will renege on their agreement to a cost-cutting plan called " climb 2011 " and will return to their original demands of a 6.4 percent pay raise and improved working conditions. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .

" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "

" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .

a dutch frigate , part of the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission , recaptured the ship and arrested the pirates .
the crew were unharmed . dutch marines on monday intervened to free a german container ship that had been attacked by pirates earlier in the day .
the dutch defense ministry and the eu 's anti-piracy mission atalanta have both confirmed the rescue .
the " ms taipan " vessel was attacked roughly 500 nautical miles east of the coast of somalia while en route from the kenyan port city of mombasa to djibouti .
dutch sailors from the " tromp " frigate tried to negotiate a peaceful release , but when this failed they stormed the vessel and arrested 10 pirates .
dutch authorities reported that one of their sailors was injured in the fight , but none of the 15-strong crew were harmed .
evasive action once the " taipan 's " crew realized they could not evade the pirates , they followed atalanta 's protocols for a ship in distress and thus managed to avoid injury and secure their rescue .
they immobilized the vessel by turning off all engines and machinery , radioed the warships patrolling the gulf of aden to call for help , and then locked themselves away in a secure part of the ship to await rescue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.04.2010 wineries in southern australia bank on german tradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in southern australia , most of the wineries are owned by descendents of german settlers southern australia has the ideal combination for a prosperous wine industry : a good climate and an influx of german settlers with a winemaking tradition .
their children now export their wines back to europe with success . if you drive north out of adelaide in south australia , there 's a point where the names of towns and streets start to have german names and the architecture changes from british colonial to 19th-century german .
every village 's main street has a german style bakery and signs touting " wurst " or " wein . "
when the grass-covered rolling hills give way to vineyards , you 've arrived in barossa valley . the pioneers who opened this area up in the 1840s were german-speaking lutherans fleeing from religious persecution in their prussian homeland . a british entrepreneur , george fife angas , and his south australia company were looking for settlers to develop the new colony and the hard-working prussian farmers fit the bill .
some 150 years ago , those families and their culture laid the foundation for australia 's prospering wine industry . aussie wines with ' get-up-and-go ' it is early autumn in the barossa valley , and that means harvest time .
there 's frantic activity , as grape growers try to time their picking exactly right . a century-and-a-half ago , the henschke family was among the first prussian settlers and their descendents still run a winery near keyneton .
during the harvest season , pickers work through the night to bring in the pinot gris harvest , which is used to make one of the few white wine varieties that comes from dark-skinned grapes . pinot gris first gained popularity in the wine-growing regions of germany , where the wine from these grapes is called " grauer burgunder . "
the variety originated in the vineyards of burgundy in france . bildunterschrift : the barossa valley is particularly known for its shiraz production stephen henschke heads the company and is the fifth generation in the family business .
after a long , dangerous journey from germany , his ancestors arrived in southern australia in 1841 . " they were from silesia and they grew riesling there , " said henschke .
" it 's logical they would have brought cuttings with them . "
and thus the family winemaking business began . although henscke produces excellent reds , he spent time in germany in the 1970s learning the art of winemaking and he also makes german-style whites and dessert wines , such as gewurztraminer . " germany was a fantastic experience .
when we got back with this education in winemaking and viticulture , i wanted to make changes to things that my father was doing , " explained henschke .
" we established more cool-climate varieties , more akin to germany . " these days , the henschke family has successfully marketed its red wines across europe .
" the aussie reds have a certain amount of sunshine and flavors and texture , " said the vintner - " a bit of get-up-and-go . " from spirits to wine another winemaker in the area , peter lehmann , has german ancestry as well but took a much different path to the wine business .
the son of a lutheran pastor , lehmann was the first in the family to go into winemaking .
when people ask him if his father was also a winemaker , he tells them , " no , he was in the spirit business . " " some people do n't get it right away ! " he added with a laugh . when lehmann was growing up , german culture was still strong in barossa valley and church services were held in german . " when i was young , " he said , " i believed that god spoke german , and i believed that until my first visit to south africa .

their children now export their wines back to europe with success . if you drive north out of adelaide in south australia , there 's a point where the names of towns and streets start to have german names and the architecture changes from british colonial to 19th-century german .
every village 's main street has a german style bakery and signs touting " wurst " or " wein . "
when the grass-covered rolling hills give way to vineyards , you 've arrived in barossa valley . the pioneers who opened this area up in the 1840s were german-speaking lutherans fleeing from religious persecution in their prussian homeland . a british entrepreneur , george fife angas , and his south australia company were looking for settlers to develop the new colony and the hard-working prussian farmers fit the bill .
some 150 years ago , those families and their culture laid the foundation for australia 's prospering wine industry . aussie wines with ' get-up-and-go ' it is early autumn in the barossa valley , and that means harvest time .
there 's frantic activity , as grape growers try to time their picking exactly right . a century-and-a-half ago , the henschke family was among the first prussian settlers and their descendents still run a winery near keyneton .
during the harvest season , pickers work through the night to bring in the pinot gris harvest , which is used to make one of the few white wine varieties that comes from dark-skinned grapes . pinot gris first gained popularity in the wine-growing regions of germany , where the wine from these grapes is called " grauer burgunder . "
the variety originated in the vineyards of burgundy in france . bildunterschrift : the barossa valley is particularly known for its shiraz production stephen henschke heads the company and is the fifth generation in the family business .
after a long , dangerous journey from germany , his ancestors arrived in southern australia in 1841 . " they were from silesia and they grew riesling there , " said henschke .
" it 's logical they would have brought cuttings with them . "
and thus the family winemaking business began . although henscke produces excellent reds , he spent time in germany in the 1970s learning the art of winemaking and he also makes german-style whites and dessert wines , such as gewurztraminer . " germany was a fantastic experience .
when we got back with this education in winemaking and viticulture , i wanted to make changes to things that my father was doing , " explained henschke .
" we established more cool-climate varieties , more akin to germany . " these days , the henschke family has successfully marketed its red wines across europe .
" the aussie reds have a certain amount of sunshine and flavors and texture , " said the vintner - " a bit of get-up-and-go . " from spirits to wine another winemaker in the area , peter lehmann , has german ancestry as well but took a much different path to the wine business .
the son of a lutheran pastor , lehmann was the first in the family to go into winemaking .
when people ask him if his father was also a winemaker , he tells them , " no , he was in the spirit business . " " some people do n't get it right away ! " he added with a laugh . when lehmann was growing up , german culture was still strong in barossa valley and church services were held in german . " when i was young , " he said , " i believed that god spoke german , and i believed that until my first visit to south africa .
then i realized that god spoke afrikaans ! " in the 1970s , an oversupply of grapes threatened the australian winemaking industry .

their children now export their wines back to europe with success . if you drive north out of adelaide in south australia , there 's a point where the names of towns and streets start to have german names and the architecture changes from british colonial to 19th-century german .
every village 's main street has a german style bakery and signs touting " wurst " or " wein . "
when the grass-covered rolling hills give way to vineyards , you 've arrived in barossa valley . the pioneers who opened this area up in the 1840s were german-speaking lutherans fleeing from religious persecution in their prussian homeland . a british entrepreneur , george fife angas , and his south australia company were looking for settlers to develop the new colony and the hard-working prussian farmers fit the bill .
some 150 years ago , those families and their culture laid the foundation for australia 's prospering wine industry . aussie wines with ' get-up-and-go ' it is early autumn in the barossa valley , and that means harvest time .
there 's frantic activity , as grape growers try to time their picking exactly right . a century-and-a-half ago , the henschke family was among the first prussian settlers and their descendents still run a winery near keyneton .
during the harvest season , pickers work through the night to bring in the pinot gris harvest , which is used to make one of the few white wine varieties that comes from dark-skinned grapes . pinot gris first gained popularity in the wine-growing regions of germany , where the wine from these grapes is called " grauer burgunder . "
the variety originated in the vineyards of burgundy in france . bildunterschrift : the barossa valley is particularly known for its shiraz production stephen henschke heads the company and is the fifth generation in the family business .
after a long , dangerous journey from germany , his ancestors arrived in southern australia in 1841 . " they were from silesia and they grew riesling there , " said henschke .
" it 's logical they would have brought cuttings with them . "
and thus the family winemaking business began . although henscke produces excellent reds , he spent time in germany in the 1970s learning the art of winemaking and he also makes german-style whites and dessert wines , such as gewurztraminer . " germany was a fantastic experience .
when we got back with this education in winemaking and viticulture , i wanted to make changes to things that my father was doing , " explained henschke .
" we established more cool-climate varieties , more akin to germany . " these days , the henschke family has successfully marketed its red wines across europe .
" the aussie reds have a certain amount of sunshine and flavors and texture , " said the vintner - " a bit of get-up-and-go . " from spirits to wine another winemaker in the area , peter lehmann , has german ancestry as well but took a much different path to the wine business .
the son of a lutheran pastor , lehmann was the first in the family to go into winemaking .
when people ask him if his father was also a winemaker , he tells them , " no , he was in the spirit business . " " some people do n't get it right away ! " he added with a laugh . when lehmann was growing up , german culture was still strong in barossa valley and church services were held in german . " when i was young , " he said , " i believed that god spoke german , and i believed that until my first visit to south africa .
then i realized that god spoke afrikaans ! " in the 1970s , an oversupply of grapes threatened the australian winemaking industry .
lehmann started a company that bought up the surplus grapes - and later became one of the country 's most respected wine producers .
now he is known as the baron of the barossa . more than 160 growers supply to peter lehmann wines and 70 percent of the finished product is exported . bildunterschrift : peter lehmann , known as the baron of the barossa , and his wife margaret reconnecting to germany " initially our biggest market was england , but we now export to 38 countries , " said lehmann , who turns 80 this year .
" one of our growing markets is germany . " white wines - particularly riesling - have always done well in australia , says lehmann , but his principal grape is the shiraz , followed by cabernet sauvignon .
he has n't yet tried selling his white wines in germany . " lots of german palates seem to appreciate the australian red wines , particularly shiraz , " said the winemaker .
" germany is a country where they do n't care how much they spend on their cars , but when it comes to food and wine they look for value . " lehmann says that these days much of the old german culture has disappeared , partly because of the two wars fought against germany , but also due to neglect . " during the second world war we were made to feel ashamed of our past , " he said .

their children now export their wines back to europe with success . if you drive north out of adelaide in south australia , there 's a point where the names of towns and streets start to have german names and the architecture changes from british colonial to 19th-century german .
every village 's main street has a german style bakery and signs touting " wurst " or " wein . "
when the grass-covered rolling hills give way to vineyards , you 've arrived in barossa valley . the pioneers who opened this area up in the 1840s were german-speaking lutherans fleeing from religious persecution in their prussian homeland . a british entrepreneur , george fife angas , and his south australia company were looking for settlers to develop the new colony and the hard-working prussian farmers fit the bill .
some 150 years ago , those families and their culture laid the foundation for australia 's prospering wine industry . aussie wines with ' get-up-and-go ' it is early autumn in the barossa valley , and that means harvest time .
there 's frantic activity , as grape growers try to time their picking exactly right . a century-and-a-half ago , the henschke family was among the first prussian settlers and their descendents still run a winery near keyneton .
during the harvest season , pickers work through the night to bring in the pinot gris harvest , which is used to make one of the few white wine varieties that comes from dark-skinned grapes . pinot gris first gained popularity in the wine-growing regions of germany , where the wine from these grapes is called " grauer burgunder . "
the variety originated in the vineyards of burgundy in france . bildunterschrift : the barossa valley is particularly known for its shiraz production stephen henschke heads the company and is the fifth generation in the family business .
after a long , dangerous journey from germany , his ancestors arrived in southern australia in 1841 . " they were from silesia and they grew riesling there , " said henschke .
" it 's logical they would have brought cuttings with them . "
and thus the family winemaking business began . although henscke produces excellent reds , he spent time in germany in the 1970s learning the art of winemaking and he also makes german-style whites and dessert wines , such as gewurztraminer . " germany was a fantastic experience .
when we got back with this education in winemaking and viticulture , i wanted to make changes to things that my father was doing , " explained henschke .
" we established more cool-climate varieties , more akin to germany . " these days , the henschke family has successfully marketed its red wines across europe .
" the aussie reds have a certain amount of sunshine and flavors and texture , " said the vintner - " a bit of get-up-and-go . " from spirits to wine another winemaker in the area , peter lehmann , has german ancestry as well but took a much different path to the wine business .
the son of a lutheran pastor , lehmann was the first in the family to go into winemaking .
when people ask him if his father was also a winemaker , he tells them , " no , he was in the spirit business . " " some people do n't get it right away ! " he added with a laugh . when lehmann was growing up , german culture was still strong in barossa valley and church services were held in german . " when i was young , " he said , " i believed that god spoke german , and i believed that until my first visit to south africa .
then i realized that god spoke afrikaans ! " in the 1970s , an oversupply of grapes threatened the australian winemaking industry .
lehmann started a company that bought up the surplus grapes - and later became one of the country 's most respected wine producers .
now he is known as the baron of the barossa . more than 160 growers supply to peter lehmann wines and 70 percent of the finished product is exported . bildunterschrift : peter lehmann , known as the baron of the barossa , and his wife margaret reconnecting to germany " initially our biggest market was england , but we now export to 38 countries , " said lehmann , who turns 80 this year .
" one of our growing markets is germany . " white wines - particularly riesling - have always done well in australia , says lehmann , but his principal grape is the shiraz , followed by cabernet sauvignon .
he has n't yet tried selling his white wines in germany . " lots of german palates seem to appreciate the australian red wines , particularly shiraz , " said the winemaker .
" germany is a country where they do n't care how much they spend on their cars , but when it comes to food and wine they look for value . " lehmann says that these days much of the old german culture has disappeared , partly because of the two wars fought against germany , but also due to neglect . " during the second world war we were made to feel ashamed of our past , " he said .
" i tell people now i 'm ashamed of the fact that i was ashamed of my own heritage . " the best year yet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kies is optimistic about the 2010 harvest a short distance away , michael kies , a fifth-generation barossan , runs his family 's winery .
he has been at work in the vineyards since he was nine years old . kies ' family winery is small by barossa standards , but kies himself is passionate about winemaking .
his ancestors had been grape growers back in silesia , though it was n't until 1968 that is father became the first in the family to make wine . these days they produce quality shiraz , merlot and cabernet sauvignon .
kies says 2010 will be a good year for his wines . bildunterschrift : built by early german settlers , this house served first as a family home , then as a makeshift church until 1904 , after which it was used as a schoolhouse and post office " with this beautiful ripening weather we 've had , the fruit has well-balanced flavors and the berries have been able to fill out beautifully .
i think this will be one of the best years since 2006 , " predicted kies .
" that was a really good vintage for us but i think this one will be better . " with its ideal soil and the german winemaking know-how it inherited , the barossa valley has strong potential for good wine .
the baron of the barossa , peter lehmann , believes the area 's success was a lucky coincidence . " the lutherans came to australia for religious freedom , and fortunately for us , they were drinkers , " he said .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de alternative energy -pipe- 05.04.2010 polish builders see a boom in low-energy homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the low-energy house cost 20 percent more to build , but it saves in the long run five years ago it would have been difficult to find low-energy houses in poland .
but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .
planned policy changes at facebook could allow personal data to be passed on to third parties for commercial purposes without requiring the users to actively give their consent .
facebook widely criticzed in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook founder mark zuckerberg got mail from berlin " anyone who wishes to not have their data passed on has to use the opt-out function , " aigner said .
facebook has been widely condemned for this , as the majority of users are expected to overlook the changes and will therefore unwittingly have their personal information used for commercial purposes .
" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .
one of those is ilse aigner herself , but should facebook stick to its current model , aigner said she would see no option but to cancel her account .
google also in the line of fire recently , aigner had also railed against internet giant google 's street view project - also on grounds of privacy protection .
google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available in the us , britain , france and other countries - and google plans to extend its service to germany as well .
aigner earlier this year had described the images on google as " a million-fold violation of privacy rights . "
" no secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " she said. ai / ap / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to lufthansa , the trade union cockpit does n't want to talk . germany 's biggest airline lufthansa and the trade union cockpit remain at loggerheads , as a second pilots ' strike looms .
" so far , we have not received any notification from vc -lsb- cockpit -rsb- calling off the strike , " lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told the news agency reuters on monday .
walther said in a separate interview that cockpit had rejected the airline 's calls for arbitration in a bid to avoid the strike .
a spokesman for cockpit , which represents roughly 4,000 pilots , told the dpa news agency that the union had no intention of retracting its strike unless lufthansa cedes some ground first .
" lufthansa wants something from us , " the spokesman said .
" they want to save their company from problems , so it 's up to them to make the first move .
if they do n't adjust their position , then we will definitely strike from april 13 . "
strike two the planned four-day strike action would be the second this year ; in february roughly 2,000 flights were cancelled , even though the pilots went back to work early after pressure from a labor judge in frankfurt .
lufthansa estimated the damages of this one-day strike at 48 million euros .
bildunterschrift : lufthansa fears more mass-cancellations if the strike goes ahead lufthansa has already stated it might sue the cockpit trade union for damages after the industrial action .
the major bone of contention is how wide-ranging talks on pay and conditions for lufthansa pilots should be .
lufthansa wants to exclusively discuss the internal situation amongst the airline 's core of roughly 4,500 pilots , and to discuss its sister companies - like budget airline german wings - and their impact on lufthansa pilots at a later date .
cockpit is calling for immediate measures to protect lufthansa from internal competition , as its own budget airline starts cutting into the main company 's market share .
lufthansa is unwilling to widen the discussion like this , fearing such a move might jeopardize its freedom in the marketplace .
cockpit says if its demands are not met , its pilots will renege on their agreement to a cost-cutting plan called " climb 2011 " and will return to their original demands of a 6.4 percent pay raise and improved working conditions. msh / reuters / dpa / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "

" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .

tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets to campaign for peace . the easter peace marches in germany this year focused on the conflict in afghanistan , shortly after three more german soldiers were killed , and as foreign minister guido westerwelle described the military situation there as a " war . "
" troop withdrawal -lsb- from afghanistan -rsb- must begin immediately , " the protest organizers wrote in a statement , saying this was the only way to secure peaceful reconstruction in the country .
germany 's engagement in the afghan mission is very unpopular with the public .
over the weekend , tens of thousands of demonstrators in cities like berlin , hamburg , frankfurt , stuttgart and munich also protested against atomic weapons , military spending , and war in general .
the demonstrations are part of a 50-year tradition of pacifist marches during the christian holiday weekend of easter .
" i like peace - krieg ist mies " as usual , protestors around the country paraded with various banners calling for an end to war , with the roughly 1,200 in munich preferring the motto " i like peace - krieg ist mies " , a message which roughly translates as " war sucks . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's easter marches began 50 years ago in 1960 the leader of the network of the german peace movement , manfred stenner , described the marches as a " living tradition , and a necessary correction to the failures of the german government in governing to promote peace . "
" the new developments over easter have reminded us of the oft-repressed and brutal reality of the war in afghanistan , and of its hopelessness , " stenner said , referring to an attack on bundeswehr soldiers which killed three and wounded eight on friday , and to a friendly fire incident in which six afghan soldiers died .
stenner said members of the peace movement mourn the death of the german soldiers , and of all the " needless victims " of the war .
the german government recently agreed to send a further 850 soldiers to afghanistan , and over easter foreign minister guido westerwelle stated that bundeswehr soldiers will stay until their work is done .
organizers of the easter marches estimate that up to 40,000 people took to the streets over the course of the weekend at around 70 marches around the country .
the german peace marches began in 1960 , following the lead of similar events in britain , and became a central feature of the civilian movement against nuclear weapons , especially during the 1980s. msh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , ngos that help sex workers are skeptical about the campaign . prostitution is famously the world 's oldest profession .
in cambodia , the government recently decided to target the sex industry in a move it thinks will combat the trafficking of women . 60 brothels , karaoke bars and massage parlors have been raided in phnom penh and across the country in the past month alone . some 300 sex workers are thought to have lost their jobs since the crackdown began in early march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers are bearing the brunt of the government 's campaign limiting access to sexual health services organizations that help sex workers worry it is driving them away from established venues , and limiting their access to sexual health services . tony lisle , the country head of unaids , the united nations agency tasked with the prevention of hiv and aids , says the crackdown is the latest in a series of similar moves by the authorities in recent years , which do not have very positive effects . " from the perspective of unaids , the crackdowns create significant difficulties for organizations working in hiv prevention to reach those who are most at risk from hiv infection effectively , particularly sex workers and women working in the entertainment industry . " important to separate prostitution and trafficking moreover , although the authorities say this drive is part of an anti-trafficking campaign , so far no traffickers have been arrested – only sex workers . lisle says it is important to separate the issues of prostitution and human trafficking . a survey last year found that no more than 7 percent of sex workers had been trafficked into the trade .
" however , they are often the victims of the crackdown , " says lisle . sex workers are losing out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three men are thought to pay for sex in cambodia ly pisey is a technical assistant at the women ’ s network for unity , a collective that advocates rights and sexual health for sex workers that holds meetings for sex workers so that they can pass on information on sexual health and rights .
she says that " the situation is very difficult " right now and it is hard to access sex workers . " we are like thieves .
if we want to send out a message on safe sex , we have to call some of the sex workers whom we know and who trust us to come to our drop-in centre .
sometimes we meet one and ask them to share the information and tell them to continue to have hope , " she explains . it seems highly unlikely that the government ’ s move will fulfill its stated goal of eliminating prostitution – not least since one in three cambodian men are thought to pay for sex . however , the wave of arrests is certainly driving sex workers underground and away from the assistance they and their clients need .
it seems very likely that if the crackdown continues it will result in a higher rate of sexually-transmitted diseases . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a loss for the ruling cdu-fdp coalition could mean trouble on the federal level . the crucial upcoming election in the german state of north rhine-westphalia is too close to call , according to a poll published in the german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the poll , commissioned by surveying firm emnid , projects that in the election on may 9 , neither the ruling christian democrat-free democrat coalition nor a partnership between the social democrats and the greens will be able to land a majority .
according to the survey , premier juergen ruettgers and his christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- currently have 38 percent support , while the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- sit at eight percent .
the social democratic party has the support of 32 percent of voters , with the greens coming in at 12 percent .
the poll said the socialist left party , in the state 's political mix for the first time , currently has the support of seven percent of voters .
spd-greens-left coalition ?
the bild article noted that an spd-greens-left government could become a reality , though spd state leader hannelore kraft said her party would not consider such a coalition .
" the left party in nrw is neither ready to govern nor does it want to govern , " kraft told the bild am sonntag .
the outcome of the election could have significant effects on germany 's national political landscape .
if the current government is defeated , the ruling federal cdu-fdp coalition led by chancellor angela merkel could lose its majority in the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat. cmk / afp / apn / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in response to high heating bills and a recent eu directive on low-energy home building , they are becoming increasingly common . in poland this winter , like in much of northern europe , prices for electricity and heating were on the rise .
the long stretch of very cold weather was felt not only in peoples ' bones , but in their wallets as well .
for jaroslaw botkiewicz , however , the extreme cold was n't a big problem .
he and his family have lived in an energy-efficient house for the past two years .
and while it cost 20 percent more to build the house , botkiewicz expects to recoup his money over time .
" i expect that in about 10 years i will have made up the extra building costs " through saved energy costs , botkiewicz told deutsche welle .
the house was built using styrofoam insulation , which is particularly warm .
the windows are triple-glazed , the doors and parts of the room are insulated for warmth , and solar panels and a chimney that also heats water for home use , are the key elements in cutting botkiewicz 's energy costs threefold .
clear decision the decision to build an energy efficient house was not a difficult one to make , the 33-year old said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more people are trying to build energy efficient homes in poland " my wife and i discussed whether to build a standard house or a modern , energy efficient one .
i read trade journals , surfed the internet , and saw what was being built in other countries .
we decided on a low-energy house and we 're really happy with it , " he said .
when botkiewicz made his decision two years ago , he was something of a pioneer in the region .
but energy awareness has grown in poland since then , said andrzej walkowicz , who was the contractor on botkiewicz 's house .
the fact that more and more low-energy houses are being built means the competition in the sector is growing , and building costs are dropping .
in fact , walkowicz said , botkiewicz 's house today would cost 10 percent less to build .
competition in the sector grows " there are more and more companies that make energy-saving elements , which means competition is increasing and materials are getting cheaper .
they are mostly polish companies , but their know-how comes from abroad - mostly from germany , " walkowicz said .
the boom in low-energy housing in poland first started taking off about five years ago , shortly after poland entered the european union .
" the eu demanded the polish government to look for ways to save energy , and also to protect the environment , " walkowicz said .
that ideology got a further boost when the eu recently passed guidelines that said all houses built as of january 1 , 2009 need to show an energy-performance certificate that shows the house meets certain energy-usage standards .
that directive has tripled business for walkowicz , who has had experience in building low-energy houses .
" the mind-set in poland has changed this year to the point where people are asking of their own accord about energy-saving elements .
for example , triple-glazed windows are in great demand , " he said .
" and people do n't react badly when i suggest especially thick roof insulation , like they used to .
people expect me to give them more and more suggestions on how to cut their energy costs as much as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eu directive gave the industry a push plea for government aid despite this growing interest , walkowicz says he is sure there would be even more interest in energy-saving building methods if the government were to subsidize peoples ' personal investments .
unlike in germany , there are no subventions or tax breaks for building a low-energy house in poland .
and except for one environmental bank , no banks offer cheaper loans for people who choose green building methods , walkowicz said .
the home builder pays the investment out-of-pocket .
if government subsidies had been available , home-owner botkiewicz says , he would have gone even farther and built a complete ' passive house ' instead of just incorporating some energy saving measures .
" the costs for a passive house are definitely too high .
we did the math and realized it would n't be worthwhile if we only recouped our investment in 20 years .
you do n't know what will happen in such a long time span , " botkiewicz said .

in an open letter to ceo mark zuckerberg she urged the social networking site to review its privacy policy . germany 's consumer protection minister ilse aigner on monday called on facebook to review it 's privacy policy " without delay . "
aigner wrote an open letter to ceo and founder mark zuckerberg , criticizing the social networking site over its handling of personal data .
" private information must remain private , " the cabinet minister wrote in the letter released to various german media .
" unfortunately , facebook does not respect this wish . "
aigner quoted a recent study by a german consumer protection organization , which said facebook blatantly fails to sufficiently safeguard its users ' privacy .
planned policy changes at facebook could allow personal data to be passed on to third parties for commercial purposes without requiring the users to actively give their consent .
facebook widely criticzed in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook founder mark zuckerberg got mail from berlin " anyone who wishes to not have their data passed on has to use the opt-out function , " aigner said .
facebook has been widely condemned for this , as the majority of users are expected to overlook the changes and will therefore unwittingly have their personal information used for commercial purposes .
" i expect facebook to review its privacy policy without delay .
the planned changes to the terms and conditions have to be explicitly communicated to the users before being implicated , " aigner wrote .
the social networking site facebook has over 400 million users worldwide , 7.5 of who are in germany .
one of those is ilse aigner herself , but should facebook stick to its current model , aigner said she would see no option but to cancel her account .
google also in the line of fire recently , aigner had also railed against internet giant google 's street view project - also on grounds of privacy protection .
google 's street view offers 360-degree pictures taken along streets in cities and towns across a country .
the service is already available in the us , britain , france and other countries - and google plans to extend its service to germany as well .
aigner earlier this year had described the images on google as " a million-fold violation of privacy rights . "
" no secret service in the world would hunt for images in such a cavalier manner , " she said. ai / ap / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 05.04.2010 ukraine scraps nato accession plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joining nato is off the table , current ties are ' sufficient ' the ukrainian president has dissolved the commission which was to work towards nato membership .
it 's the latest move to abandon the pro-western stance of the ' orange revolution ' and re-establish ties with russia . since the election of viktor yanukovych in february , ukraine has made no secret of its intention to abandon its goal of joining nato .
now , yanukovych has by decree dissolved the commission that was to lay the groundwork for membership .
the move hardly comes as a surprise - it 's the final step in ukraine 's process of abandoning the pro-western ambitions of the ' orange revolution ' that once swept yanukovych out of power .
now , as he 's back at the helm , yanukovych said the current level of cooperation with nato was " sufficient . "
yet the move will nonetheless strain the relations with the alliance . " it 's quite a sharp statement , " natalia bugayova of the kyiv post newspaper told deutsche welle .
" dissolving the commission which was to prepare ukraine for joining nato is quite a radical move and i think it will certainly exacerbate the relationship with the west . "
picking up ties with moscow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych was ousted by the ' orange revolution ' but returned to power in 2010 ukraine turning its back on nato is a move that 's sure to make the kremlin happy .
moscow has for years been trying to pressure ukraine into abandoning its nato ambitions ; using gas prices as a leverage to force kyiv in line . under the previous pro-western leadership of president yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko , relations with russia had hit rock bottom .
when pro-russian yanukovych narrowly made it back into office in february 2010 , he promised a " new page " in ties with its larger neighbour , even calling russia a " natural ally " to ukraine .
" in terms of our political and foreign relations , russia still is the most dominant and closest neighbour to ukraine , " natalia bugayova told deutsche welle , adding that being on good terms with russia is vital to kyiv regardless of how tempting nato membership might have seemed to the previous government .
" after five years of complete exacerbation of our ties and relations with russia further pursuing nato membership would not have been the right move at this point .
relations are still strained between kyiv and moscow . "
striking the balance between east and west the population in ukraine is strongly divided over the issue .
eastern ukraine and the crimea are pro-russian and accordingly see nato as an old cold war enemy .
western ukraine , however , is more pro-western ; and subsequently in favor of nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the previous government in kyiv , ties with moscow had suffered dramatically in order to avoid an escalation of the strains within the country , president yanukovych has been careful not to move too boldly towards the kremlin .
his first foreign trip since taking office was to brussels , not to moscow .
" i think that at this point the move towards russia will not be as rapid as some might have expected .
the government is still trying to maintain the image of being independent , " bugayova said .
on easter monday , yanukovych travelled to moscow in a visit that - although billed as " private " - included talks with his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev .
the two countries ' warming relations have already translated into increased military cooperation - for instance restarting joint naval exercises .
but despite the move towards russia , the government in kyiv vowed last month not to join any military alliance , preparing a law that would make any such membership illegal .

yet doubts persist about whether recovery can be sustained and whether benefits of the recovery are reaching workers . economic data released late last week indicate that the european union is showing sings of sustained economic recovery .
the data shows that manufacturing throughout the euro zone grew more quickly than expected in march .
manufacturing in germany grew at the fastest rate in 10 years , while french manufacturing output increased at the fastest rate since 2006 .
manufacturing output in britain also grew more quickly than expected .
greece , in the midst of a debt crisis , saw its manufacturing output decrease .
however , the greek crisis , which has driven down the value of the euro , actually ended up benefitting the euro-zone economy as a whole : european goods were cheaper for overseas customers , which led to an increase in demand , which in turn drove higher manufacturing outputs .
" we are seeing world trade booming , it 's recovering very sharply .
emerging markets were driving this at the beginning but developed markets are also now catching up , " nick kounis , economist at fortis bank in amsterdam , said last week .
part of a worldwide trend growth in europe is part of a worldwide upswing in manufacturing output .
bildunterschrift : german manufacturing grew at the fastest rate in 10 years in the united states , the manufacturing sector grew at the fastest rate in five years .
similar gains were made by countries throughout asia .
the manufacturing news is the latest in a string of positive economic signs that are sustaining hope that the world economy is beginning to experience sustained growth after the worst financial downturn in decades .
this hope has sent world financial markets to their highest levels in 18 months .
" we had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturing data around the world , " said matthew strauss , a senior currency strategist at rbc capital markets in toronto .
" the numbers were not out of the ballpark but were all stronger than expected , so that 's a good start to the month . "
doubts about strength of european recovery even with the positive manufacturing numbers , doubts about the sustainability of europe 's recovery persist .
although greece has held a series of successful bond auctions to raise money , it is still far from paying off its enormous debt .
also , eu consumer consumption has dragged in recent months , an indication that consumers are still reluctant to spend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is expected to keep interest rates low the european central bank is expected to keep interests rates low in the coming months in an attempt to promote borrowing and , in turn , spending .
" the recovery is still weak , and therefore the outlook for inflation remains low , " the international monetary fund said of europe 's recovery in its latest world economic outlook .
" it 's appropriate to keep interest rates exceptionally low and to act very slowly in abandoning quantitative measures and changing collateral requirements . " us officials optimistic , but see uneven recovery official reaction to the latest numbers from the european union was muted because of the easter holiday .
however , officials in the united states said the positive data was a sign that drastic steps taken in the immediate wake of the crisis such as large bailout packages for banks have worked and lead to a broader recovery .
former chairman of the us federal reserve alan , speaking on a us television show sunday , said , " there is momentum building up which is really just beginning and it 's got a way to go " and that the odds of a double dip recession are now very low .
yet , despite greenspan 's optimism , us treasury secretary timothy geithner acknowledged last week that positive economic numbers have failed to generate substantial numbers of new jobs and that the economic recovery has large benefitted large corporations .
he called the recovery to this point " deeply unfair . " df / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
