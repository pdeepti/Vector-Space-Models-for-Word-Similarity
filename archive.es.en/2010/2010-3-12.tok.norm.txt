here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "

read on for tips on spending money in germany . germany introduced the euro in 2001 .
one euro is approximately equal to $ 1.35 , 1.62 australian dollars , and 0.67 british pounds . the euro was designed for societies accustomed to carrying coin purses and paying cash and has a plethora of coins in different denominations : two euros , one euro , 50 cents , 20 cents , 10 cents , five cents , two cents and one cent . the best way to avoid paying expensive exchange fees is to withdraw cash directly from an atm -lrb- look for a bankautomat or geldautomat -rrb- .
before you go , ask your home bank if it charges a fee for using an atm abroad . it is also possible to change money or cash travellers ' cheques at any bank for a fee . paying with a credit card is not common .
most germans simply carry cash or pay with a debit card .
larger department stores and hotels accept credit cards , but smaller shops and restaurants generally do not .
restaurants and cafes never take credit cards and many do n't accept debit cards either .
it is a good idea to keep cash on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most restaurants only take cash tax is always included on the price tag .
what you see is what you pay .
in january 2007 , value-added tax was raised from 16 to 19 percent .
for selected items like books and food , tax is only 7 percent . many stores , especially grocery stores , do not give out bags for their customers ' purchases .
employing someone to bag groceries is unheard of .
bags are usually available for purchase , however many shoppers bring their own re-usable shopping bag with them . when purchasing beverages , keep in mind that most glass and plastic bottles have a " pfand " or deposit , ranging between 0.08 and 0.25 euros .
it 's a good idea to return the bottle to the same supermarket chain you purchased it at , as there are some restrictions on which bottles they refund . business hours most stores in germany open during the week at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. and close between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
they tend to close earlier on saturday , sometimes as early as 2 p.m.
in larger cities , many shops will stay open from monday through saturday until 8 p.m. , with some open until 10 p.m. some shops close for lunch , generally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
this is more common in smaller towns , but may also be the case in larger cities as well . nearly all stores are closed on sundays and public holidays .
for urgent necessities , however , you can go to a gas station convenience store .
some bakeries and flower shops also open for a few hours on sundays .
another important exception is train stations in larger cities .
shops within the station often open on sundays , and sometimes on public holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacies are marked with a giant " a " for " apotheke " pharmacies if you enjoyed a bit too much of germany 's most famous beverage , you wo n't find an aspirin in the supermarket or the drug store - and most certainly not on a sunday .
over-the-counter medications , such as pain-killers , are only sold in pharmacies , not in supermarkets or drug stores . pharmacies are very common in germany , so you will not have trouble finding one .
it 's not a good idea to go overboard on a saturday night , because only selected pharmacies are opened on sundays .
these are generally listed in the newspaper .
the pharmacies that are closed on sunday will also post a listing of those in the area that are opened . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback tell us about your experiences with money in germany .

these are available in any mobile phone shop . with a german sim card , steep roaming charges apply as soon as you cross the border into another european country . telephone calls when calling germany from abroad , use the country code + 49 and drop the first 0 in the telephone number .
when calling abroad from inside germany , dial 00 and then the country code . for long-distance calls , keep in mind that germany is one hour ahead of greenwich mean time -lrb- gmt -rrb- - that is , one hour ahead of london , six hours ahead of new york and eight hours behind sydney . telephone numbers and prefixes within germany vary in length and can range from four to eight or more digits .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .
you may find separate disposal areas for glass , paper and packaging .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .

it 's also a great way to take in the landscape - or catch up on some sleep after your long-haul flight to germany . tickets are cheaper the earlier you book them .
if you book a round-trip journey on a specific day and train at least three days in advance , you are eligible for a discount , subject to availability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book your train trip in advance for better fares children up to 14 years travel for free when accompanied by a parent or grandparent .
the number of children traveling must be included on the ticket .
groups of six or more can save as much as 70 percent , depending on how early they book . it is possible to purchase train tickets online at www.bahn.de and print them out yourself .
you can also buy them in advance or last-minute at any train station , either at the counter or at a ticket vending machine . on long-distance trains , it is possible to purchase tickets from the conductor per cash or credit card , but you have to pay an extra fee .
regional trains may have a ticket machine on board , but not necessarily .
it is advisable to purchase your ticket beforehand in the station . reserving a seat is a good idea if you are traveling at peak times -lrb- weekends , rush hour , or holidays -rrb- or if you have a lot of luggage with you .
it costs 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- per direction .
your reservation voucher will indicate a car number and a seat number .
there will be a sign at the track indicating where on the track your reserved car will stop . for train schedules and detailed price information , visit the deutsche bahn web site at www.bahn.de. trains are categorized by the distance they travel and the level of comfort they offer , which can all mean a big difference in price .
not all tickets are good for all trains . ice : intercity-express these are germany 's fastest long-distance trains and are generally more expensive .
they offer luxury services on board like laptop hook-ups and audio and visual entertainment .
ice trains only stop at bigger stations . ic / ec : intercity and eurocity the ic trains link major cities in germany , while the eurocity trains connect germany with major cities in neighboring european countries . rb : regional trains these trains service shorter routes within germany and generally make more frequent stops . thalys : paris - brussels - amsterdam - cologne this high-speed train connects cologne to paris in 4 hours -lrb- 3 hours in 2008 -rrb- . cheap flights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes flying can be the least expensive way to travel discount airlines are more common in europe than in the us .
if you 're lucky enough to snag a good deal , flying from a to b can be both quicker and cheaper than traveling by train or even by car . some airlines advertise inter-european flights as cheap as 19 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- .
these prices are subject to availability , however .
the earlier you book , the more likely you are to find a good deal .
when looking on the internet , be sure to check for taxes and fees - which can quickly quadruple the price of the actual flight . want to book an inter-european flight ?

those who stay in germany for longer than six months must apply for a german license . it is not usually necessary to carry an international driver 's license , although it serves as an additional form of identification and proof that you hold a valid driver 's license in your country .
an international driver 's license must be obtained in your home country before you leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " autobahn " is the german word for freeway the legal driving age in germany is 18 , though the age requirement for renting a car is often 21 .
getting a driver 's license usually costs between 1,500 and 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,000 to 2,700 -rrb- and requires a minimum of 25 to 45 hours of professional instruction and 12 hours of theory . though speed limit signs are n't posted everywhere , that does n't mean there are n't any .
in cities and town , the speed limit is 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- , unless otherwise posted , and it may be 30 km / h in residential areas .
on normal two-lane highways the limit is 100 km / h .
only freeways , or autobahnen , have a " suggested " speed instead of a speed limit , which is usually 130 km / h .
speeds of 160 to 200 km / h are common on some freeways . autobahn is the german word for " freeway . "
it does not refer to one particular street . if you are travelling with children , keep in mind that germany has relatively strict car-seat laws .
children shorter than 150 centimeters -lrb- 59 inches -rrb- and under the age of 12 are required to have a car-seat when riding in the car .
seat-belts are mandatory for both children and adults . visit this link for a glossary of german traffic signs : http : / / german.about.com / library / blauto _ traf.htm carpooling if you 're adventurous , interested in meeting new people and would rather spend your travel money on beer and souvenirs , then you might consider carpooling as an alternative to going by plane , train , bus or rental car . the web site www.mitfahrzentrale.de offers carpoolers the opportunity to find others heading in the same direction .
riders split the cost of gas and road tolls .
basic registration is free . public transportation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you 're caught without a ticket you 'll have to pay 40 euros on the spot public transportation in germany is generally very good , particularly in the more densely populated areas .
regulations and ticket prices vary from city to city . in busses , tickets can usually be purchased directly from the driver .
for the tram -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- or subway -lrb- u-bahn -rrb- , it 's a good idea to purchase your ticket from a vending machine at the stop or station before you board . some tram and subway cars have ticket machines in them , but not always .
those that have them only take coins . depending on the regulations in the district you 're in , it may be necessary to stamp your ticket either in the station or on the bus or train .
look for validation machines and , when in doubt , watch the other passengers or ask someone . it 's usually possible to purchase a multi-trip ticket , or a pass good for a few days , a week or a month at a time . tickets are checked by random inspection , often by plain-clothes ticket officers .
if you do not have a valid ticket , you will be forced to pay about 40 euros on the spot . bicycles in many places in germany , bicycles are not only a form of recreation or sport , but also an essential method of transportation .
it 's common to see adults in business suits riding their bike through the city , perhaps with groceries in the basket behind their seat .
cyclists are generally permitted to ride on the street , even if no bike lane is marked . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

read on for tips on spending money in germany . germany introduced the euro in 2001 .
one euro is approximately equal to $ 1.35 , 1.62 australian dollars , and 0.67 british pounds . the euro was designed for societies accustomed to carrying coin purses and paying cash and has a plethora of coins in different denominations : two euros , one euro , 50 cents , 20 cents , 10 cents , five cents , two cents and one cent . the best way to avoid paying expensive exchange fees is to withdraw cash directly from an atm -lrb- look for a bankautomat or geldautomat -rrb- .
before you go , ask your home bank if it charges a fee for using an atm abroad . it is also possible to change money or cash travellers ' cheques at any bank for a fee . paying with a credit card is not common .
most germans simply carry cash or pay with a debit card .
larger department stores and hotels accept credit cards , but smaller shops and restaurants generally do not .
restaurants and cafes never take credit cards and many do n't accept debit cards either .
it is a good idea to keep cash on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most restaurants only take cash tax is always included on the price tag .
what you see is what you pay .
in january 2007 , value-added tax was raised from 16 to 19 percent .
for selected items like books and food , tax is only 7 percent . many stores , especially grocery stores , do not give out bags for their customers ' purchases .
employing someone to bag groceries is unheard of .
bags are usually available for purchase , however many shoppers bring their own re-usable shopping bag with them . when purchasing beverages , keep in mind that most glass and plastic bottles have a " pfand " or deposit , ranging between 0.08 and 0.25 euros .
it 's a good idea to return the bottle to the same supermarket chain you purchased it at , as there are some restrictions on which bottles they refund . business hours most stores in germany open during the week at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. and close between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
they tend to close earlier on saturday , sometimes as early as 2 p.m.
in larger cities , many shops will stay open from monday through saturday until 8 p.m. , with some open until 10 p.m. some shops close for lunch , generally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
this is more common in smaller towns , but may also be the case in larger cities as well . nearly all stores are closed on sundays and public holidays .
for urgent necessities , however , you can go to a gas station convenience store .
some bakeries and flower shops also open for a few hours on sundays .
another important exception is train stations in larger cities .
shops within the station often open on sundays , and sometimes on public holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacies are marked with a giant " a " for " apotheke " pharmacies if you enjoyed a bit too much of germany 's most famous beverage , you wo n't find an aspirin in the supermarket or the drug store - and most certainly not on a sunday .
over-the-counter medications , such as pain-killers , are only sold in pharmacies , not in supermarkets or drug stores . pharmacies are very common in germany , so you will not have trouble finding one .
it 's not a good idea to go overboard on a saturday night , because only selected pharmacies are opened on sundays .

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .
it 's also very important to look each person at the table in the eye while you chink glasses with them .
-lrb- according to local myth , those who drop their eyes are destined to seven years of bad sex . -rrb- in germany , kids are allowed to drink beer and wine from the age of 16 .
they can drink hard liquor once they 're 18 . unless you look like a pre-adolescent , it 's very unlikely you will be asked to show identification .
also , drinking in public is legal in germany , so do n't be surprised if you see the occasional sidewalk drinker - without a paper bag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't leave money on the table , always pay the server directly paying in most restaurants and cafes , tipping is optional .
it 's customary to round up the bill , or tip approximately five to 10 percent .
for example , if the bill is 2.80 euros , give the server 3.00 euros .
if the bill comes to 22.40 euros , give 25.00 euros .
if you were very happy with the service give more . if you have the correct change , say , " stimmt so . "
if you would like change back , say the total amount you would like to pay . be aware that most restaurants do not accept credit cards , so make sure you have enough cash before you go out to eat . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures beer , beer , beer feedback tell us about your experiences dining out in germany .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .

read on for tips on spending money in germany . germany introduced the euro in 2001 .
one euro is approximately equal to $ 1.35 , 1.62 australian dollars , and 0.67 british pounds . the euro was designed for societies accustomed to carrying coin purses and paying cash and has a plethora of coins in different denominations : two euros , one euro , 50 cents , 20 cents , 10 cents , five cents , two cents and one cent . the best way to avoid paying expensive exchange fees is to withdraw cash directly from an atm -lrb- look for a bankautomat or geldautomat -rrb- .
before you go , ask your home bank if it charges a fee for using an atm abroad . it is also possible to change money or cash travellers ' cheques at any bank for a fee . paying with a credit card is not common .
most germans simply carry cash or pay with a debit card .
larger department stores and hotels accept credit cards , but smaller shops and restaurants generally do not .
restaurants and cafes never take credit cards and many do n't accept debit cards either .
it is a good idea to keep cash on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most restaurants only take cash tax is always included on the price tag .
what you see is what you pay .
in january 2007 , value-added tax was raised from 16 to 19 percent .
for selected items like books and food , tax is only 7 percent . many stores , especially grocery stores , do not give out bags for their customers ' purchases .
employing someone to bag groceries is unheard of .
bags are usually available for purchase , however many shoppers bring their own re-usable shopping bag with them . when purchasing beverages , keep in mind that most glass and plastic bottles have a " pfand " or deposit , ranging between 0.08 and 0.25 euros .
it 's a good idea to return the bottle to the same supermarket chain you purchased it at , as there are some restrictions on which bottles they refund . business hours most stores in germany open during the week at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. and close between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
they tend to close earlier on saturday , sometimes as early as 2 p.m.
in larger cities , many shops will stay open from monday through saturday until 8 p.m. , with some open until 10 p.m. some shops close for lunch , generally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
this is more common in smaller towns , but may also be the case in larger cities as well . nearly all stores are closed on sundays and public holidays .
for urgent necessities , however , you can go to a gas station convenience store .
some bakeries and flower shops also open for a few hours on sundays .
another important exception is train stations in larger cities .
shops within the station often open on sundays , and sometimes on public holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacies are marked with a giant " a " for " apotheke " pharmacies if you enjoyed a bit too much of germany 's most famous beverage , you wo n't find an aspirin in the supermarket or the drug store - and most certainly not on a sunday .
over-the-counter medications , such as pain-killers , are only sold in pharmacies , not in supermarkets or drug stores . pharmacies are very common in germany , so you will not have trouble finding one .
it 's not a good idea to go overboard on a saturday night , because only selected pharmacies are opened on sundays .
these are generally listed in the newspaper .
the pharmacies that are closed on sunday will also post a listing of those in the area that are opened . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .
you may find separate disposal areas for glass , paper and packaging .
private homes may also have a separate container for organic waste , such as coffee grinds and food leftovers . many germans take recycling and trash separation seriously and ignorance of or indifference to the practice may be looked down upon . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you have any social tips to add ?

it 's also a great way to take in the landscape - or catch up on some sleep after your long-haul flight to germany . tickets are cheaper the earlier you book them .
if you book a round-trip journey on a specific day and train at least three days in advance , you are eligible for a discount , subject to availability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book your train trip in advance for better fares children up to 14 years travel for free when accompanied by a parent or grandparent .
the number of children traveling must be included on the ticket .
groups of six or more can save as much as 70 percent , depending on how early they book . it is possible to purchase train tickets online at www.bahn.de and print them out yourself .
you can also buy them in advance or last-minute at any train station , either at the counter or at a ticket vending machine . on long-distance trains , it is possible to purchase tickets from the conductor per cash or credit card , but you have to pay an extra fee .
regional trains may have a ticket machine on board , but not necessarily .
it is advisable to purchase your ticket beforehand in the station . reserving a seat is a good idea if you are traveling at peak times -lrb- weekends , rush hour , or holidays -rrb- or if you have a lot of luggage with you .
it costs 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- per direction .
your reservation voucher will indicate a car number and a seat number .
there will be a sign at the track indicating where on the track your reserved car will stop . for train schedules and detailed price information , visit the deutsche bahn web site at www.bahn.de. trains are categorized by the distance they travel and the level of comfort they offer , which can all mean a big difference in price .
not all tickets are good for all trains . ice : intercity-express these are germany 's fastest long-distance trains and are generally more expensive .
they offer luxury services on board like laptop hook-ups and audio and visual entertainment .
ice trains only stop at bigger stations . ic / ec : intercity and eurocity the ic trains link major cities in germany , while the eurocity trains connect germany with major cities in neighboring european countries . rb : regional trains these trains service shorter routes within germany and generally make more frequent stops . thalys : paris - brussels - amsterdam - cologne this high-speed train connects cologne to paris in 4 hours -lrb- 3 hours in 2008 -rrb- . cheap flights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes flying can be the least expensive way to travel discount airlines are more common in europe than in the us .
if you 're lucky enough to snag a good deal , flying from a to b can be both quicker and cheaper than traveling by train or even by car . some airlines advertise inter-european flights as cheap as 19 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- .
these prices are subject to availability , however .
the earlier you book , the more likely you are to find a good deal .
when looking on the internet , be sure to check for taxes and fees - which can quickly quadruple the price of the actual flight . want to book an inter-european flight ?

those who stay in germany for longer than six months must apply for a german license . it is not usually necessary to carry an international driver 's license , although it serves as an additional form of identification and proof that you hold a valid driver 's license in your country .

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .
it 's also very important to look each person at the table in the eye while you chink glasses with them .
-lrb- according to local myth , those who drop their eyes are destined to seven years of bad sex . -rrb- in germany , kids are allowed to drink beer and wine from the age of 16 .
they can drink hard liquor once they 're 18 . unless you look like a pre-adolescent , it 's very unlikely you will be asked to show identification .
also , drinking in public is legal in germany , so do n't be surprised if you see the occasional sidewalk drinker - without a paper bag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't leave money on the table , always pay the server directly paying in most restaurants and cafes , tipping is optional .
it 's customary to round up the bill , or tip approximately five to 10 percent .
for example , if the bill is 2.80 euros , give the server 3.00 euros .
if the bill comes to 22.40 euros , give 25.00 euros .
if you were very happy with the service give more . if you have the correct change , say , " stimmt so . "
if you would like change back , say the total amount you would like to pay . be aware that most restaurants do not accept credit cards , so make sure you have enough cash before you go out to eat . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures beer , beer , beer 9800 dw-tv europe live germany today - window on germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

read on for tips on spending money in germany . germany introduced the euro in 2001 .
one euro is approximately equal to $ 1.35 , 1.62 australian dollars , and 0.67 british pounds . the euro was designed for societies accustomed to carrying coin purses and paying cash and has a plethora of coins in different denominations : two euros , one euro , 50 cents , 20 cents , 10 cents , five cents , two cents and one cent . the best way to avoid paying expensive exchange fees is to withdraw cash directly from an atm -lrb- look for a bankautomat or geldautomat -rrb- .
before you go , ask your home bank if it charges a fee for using an atm abroad . it is also possible to change money or cash travellers ' cheques at any bank for a fee . paying with a credit card is not common .
most germans simply carry cash or pay with a debit card .
larger department stores and hotels accept credit cards , but smaller shops and restaurants generally do not .
restaurants and cafes never take credit cards and many do n't accept debit cards either .
it is a good idea to keep cash on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most restaurants only take cash tax is always included on the price tag .
what you see is what you pay .
in january 2007 , value-added tax was raised from 16 to 19 percent .
for selected items like books and food , tax is only 7 percent . many stores , especially grocery stores , do not give out bags for their customers ' purchases .
employing someone to bag groceries is unheard of .
bags are usually available for purchase , however many shoppers bring their own re-usable shopping bag with them . when purchasing beverages , keep in mind that most glass and plastic bottles have a " pfand " or deposit , ranging between 0.08 and 0.25 euros .
it 's a good idea to return the bottle to the same supermarket chain you purchased it at , as there are some restrictions on which bottles they refund . business hours most stores in germany open during the week at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. and close between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
they tend to close earlier on saturday , sometimes as early as 2 p.m.
in larger cities , many shops will stay open from monday through saturday until 8 p.m. , with some open until 10 p.m. some shops close for lunch , generally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
this is more common in smaller towns , but may also be the case in larger cities as well . nearly all stores are closed on sundays and public holidays .
for urgent necessities , however , you can go to a gas station convenience store .
some bakeries and flower shops also open for a few hours on sundays .
another important exception is train stations in larger cities .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .
you may find separate disposal areas for glass , paper and packaging .
private homes may also have a separate container for organic waste , such as coffee grinds and food leftovers . many germans take recycling and trash separation seriously and ignorance of or indifference to the practice may be looked down upon . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you have any social tips to add ?

the priest later sexually abused minors again . pope benedict xvi , in his position as bishop of munich and freising , approved the re-housing of a priest accused of child sex abuse in his diocese in 1980 , it was revealed friday . " it was decided in 1980 to give h. -lsb- the priest -rsb- accommodation in a rectory so that he could receive therapy .
the archbishop took part in this decision , " the diocese of munich and freising said in a statement . the diocese confirmed that the priest in question was in munich to undergo therapy after sexually abusing young boys .
according to the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung , he was accused of forcing an 11-year old boy to perform oral sex . known paedophile allowed to work with children the priest was later returned to pastoral work .
archbishop josef ratzinger - now pope benedict - was unaware of the move at the time , according to his former diocese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope received the head of the german catholic church robert zollitsch on friday ratzinger oversaw the diocese from 1980-1982 , during which time no further offenses by the priest were reported . the priest , identified in the german media only by the initial " h. , " again faced allegations of child sex abuse in 1985 and was temporarily relieved of his duties .
he received a suspended prison sentence and a fine for the sexual abuse of minors . but the accused sex offender subsequently received additional church duties and continues to work for the church , though he has been barred from working with young people since 2008 , the diocese said . the former vicar-general for the diocese gerhard gruber was quick to take the blame for the decision .
" the repeated employment of h. in priestly spiritual duties was a bad mistake .
i assume all responsibility , " gruber said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canisius catholic school was hit by the abuse scandal late january hundreds of victims the vatican refused to give a statement on the issue on friday evening , referring instead to the diocese of munich and freising . the development is the latest in an ongoing sex abuse scandal rocking the catholic church in germany .
the church came under heavy criticism after an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to the systematic sexual abuse of its pupils by two roman catholic priests . more alleged victims have since come forward , including a former member of the prestigious all-boys choir in regensburg led from 1964-1994 by the pope 's brother , georg ratzinger . so far around 120 people have come forward alleging abuse by leaders of the catholic church .

but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .

another is the willingness of the local mayors .

" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "

greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .

westerwelle 's diplomatic trips großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle dismissed the claims as a ' personal attack ' as guido westerwelle wraps up his trip through south america , the foreign minister is accused of pursuing personal interests in choosing his accompanying business delegation .
but how are these delegations really chosen ? foreign minister guido westerwelle has faced extensive allegations of combining his official diplomatic trips with personal business interests .
on friday , members of several opposition parties vehemently criticized the minister for bringing a business partner of his brother on a diplomatic trip to asia in january , saying he had made the choice based more on his own interests than those of germany .
" westerwelle is damaging the federal republic , he is damaging the image of the foreign ministry , " said renate kuenast , a senior figure in the green party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is under fire for bringing his partner -lrb- left -rrb- in connection with his latest whirlwind journey to south america , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , westerwelle was criticized for bringing along his life partner , michael mronz , who was allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
german chancellor angela merkel came out in defense of westerwelle and his selection of business delegations that have accompanied him on past diplomatic journeys , saying she was " confident that the foreign minister 's selections were in full compliance with the rules , " according to a statement from berlin on friday .
how the process works but the controversy surrounding westerwelle 's business delegations begs the question : how does the german foreign ministry choose which business representatives travel on official diplomatic journeys ?
according to spokesman stefan bredohl , when the foreign ministry announces the planning of a trip , the german embassy in the host country puts together a list of economic areas of interest in that country and sends it to berlin .
particular emphasis , says bredohl , is placed on regions where " significant projects - such as renewable energy , as was the case in china - are already in place where german companies can then further economic development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media has made a big deal of who travels with the foreign minister the foreign ministry then consults the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- to create a list of some 60 companies that could accompany the foreign minister .
westerwelle has the final say which companies can send a representative to travel with him ; in most cases , his business delegation consists of between 10 and 20 representatives .
customary practice according to professor thomas fischer , a political scientist at the brussels office of the bertelsman foundation , the delegations that accompany german diplomatic trips are " very similar " to those of other countries .
fischer added that westerwelle 's " handpicking " of business representatives was " nothing new , " and that " if foreign ministers could n't choose the people they brought with them on their diplomatic journeys , this would be a disservice to both the german government and economy . "
" merkel , schroeder , steinmeier , they all formed their entourages themselves , " fischer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder also brought whomever he wanted , says fischer " in principle , there is nothing wrong with lobbyism , or with governments being accompanied by strategically chosen representatives .
the question is , and i think this is relevant in the westerwelle issue , is whether the representatives are actually strategically chosen , " he added .
westerwelle fights back the allegations facing westerwelle are indeed not based on whether he was pursuing economic interests on his trips , which has been the case in the past with his pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but rather that he was pursuing merely personal interests .
westerwelle strongly denied all claims against him on friday and accused those who made the allegations of attempting to defame him and his family .
he added that all delegations he has brought with him since becoming foreign minister late last year " fully deserved to represent germany and its economic interests abroad . "

westerwelle fights back the allegations facing westerwelle are indeed not based on whether he was pursuing economic interests on his trips , which has been the case in the past with his pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but rather that he was pursuing merely personal interests .
westerwelle strongly denied all claims against him on friday and accused those who made the allegations of attempting to defame him and his family .

westerwelle 's diplomatic trips großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle dismissed the claims as a ' personal attack ' as guido westerwelle wraps up his trip through south america , the foreign minister is accused of pursuing personal interests in choosing his accompanying business delegation .
but how are these delegations really chosen ? foreign minister guido westerwelle has faced extensive allegations of combining his official diplomatic trips with personal business interests .
on friday , members of several opposition parties vehemently criticized the minister for bringing a business partner of his brother on a diplomatic trip to asia in january , saying he had made the choice based more on his own interests than those of germany .
" westerwelle is damaging the federal republic , he is damaging the image of the foreign ministry , " said renate kuenast , a senior figure in the green party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is under fire for bringing his partner -lrb- left -rrb- in connection with his latest whirlwind journey to south america , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , westerwelle was criticized for bringing along his life partner , michael mronz , who was allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
german chancellor angela merkel came out in defense of westerwelle and his selection of business delegations that have accompanied him on past diplomatic journeys , saying she was " confident that the foreign minister 's selections were in full compliance with the rules , " according to a statement from berlin on friday .
how the process works but the controversy surrounding westerwelle 's business delegations begs the question : how does the german foreign ministry choose which business representatives travel on official diplomatic journeys ?
according to spokesman stefan bredohl , when the foreign ministry announces the planning of a trip , the german embassy in the host country puts together a list of economic areas of interest in that country and sends it to berlin .
particular emphasis , says bredohl , is placed on regions where " significant projects - such as renewable energy , as was the case in china - are already in place where german companies can then further economic development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media has made a big deal of who travels with the foreign minister the foreign ministry then consults the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- to create a list of some 60 companies that could accompany the foreign minister .
westerwelle has the final say which companies can send a representative to travel with him ; in most cases , his business delegation consists of between 10 and 20 representatives .
customary practice according to professor thomas fischer , a political scientist at the brussels office of the bertelsman foundation , the delegations that accompany german diplomatic trips are " very similar " to those of other countries .
fischer added that westerwelle 's " handpicking " of business representatives was " nothing new , " and that " if foreign ministers could n't choose the people they brought with them on their diplomatic journeys , this would be a disservice to both the german government and economy . "
" merkel , schroeder , steinmeier , they all formed their entourages themselves , " fischer told deutsche welle .

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .

the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .

ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .

the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "
this year 's conference is scheduled for may 17. acb / dpa / kna / epd editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .
heavy regulation in the energy market often translates to market values of grids being much lower than regulated values .
the grid serves about 18 million people in eastern and northern germany and covers 9,700 kilometers of high-voltage lines .
the sale increases elia 's holdings to 143,000 square kilometers serving 29 million customers .
utilities across europe have sold off lucrative but state-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable energy markets , where limited competition often leads to a market oligopoly .
last month , german 's largest power company e.on sold its grid to dutch group tennet for 1.1 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 12.03.2010 traffickers use voodoo to threaten nigerian victims into prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are forced to take oaths they believe will bring disaster upon them if broken german federal police say they have noticed a disturbing new trend in human trafficking .
some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 12.03.2010 egyptians hoping elbaradei can provide change they can believe in 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei has mobilised a coalition of egypt 's opposition former un nuclear chief mohammed elbaradei has made no official announcement about running for egypt 's presidency in 2011 but a surge of support built on the hope for change is sweeping him closer to the campaign trail . such is the desire for change among liberal thinkers in egypt that any sliver of hope of overturning almost three decades of rule by president hosni mubarak is enthusiastically championed .
it does n't seem to matter that the next presidential election is over a year away or that potential reformist leaders are wildly celebrated despite not being legally allowed to run for office .
it appears that a slim chance is better than none at all .
the reception afforded mohammed elbaradei on his homecoming to cairo last week seemed to sum up the mood of many who have grown up under mubarak 's increasingly oppressive and divisive leadership .
rapturous crowds of thousands welcomed elbaradei , many inspired by the calls from egypt 's normally moribund opposition figures for him to run against mubarak in 2011 , if the 81-year-old incumbent decides to stand again .
the reaction to elbaradei 's return also smacked of desperation .
the nobel peace prize laureate is officially banned under egypt 's constitution from running for president .
amendments to the constitution passed in 2005 and 2007 prohibit him from doing so , a fact well-known among the celebrating masses .
and yet , he was still welcomed as a national hero and saviour .
while neither counting himself in nor ruling himself out , elbaradei has certainly stirred up debate over the future of egypt , a country that has a history of strongly suppressing dissent and criticism of the president and his methods .
support from cross-section of egyptian society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public support has led to elbaradei being championed echoing another leader who was swept to power on a public longing for change , elbaradei has already formed a ' coalition for change , ' a group of like-minded opposition leaders aimed at reforming egypt 's constitution .
claiming that 99 percent of egyptians want their country to head in a new direction , elbaradei has also begun rallying " the poor and the rich , the young and the old … women wearing the niqab , the hijab , or not veiled at all ; intellectuals ; peasants ; people of all ages and classes . "
but much like us president barack obama , elbaradei has made it clear that he does not want to be seen as a saviour .
however , just as huge expectations pushed obama to the white house , it may already be too late .
" elbaradei has become the symbol of the hope for change for millions of egyptians , " novelist alaa al-aswani told reporters on tuesday .
government restrictions make candidacy near impossible despite the growing movement behind elbaradei , analysts say election rules make it almost impossible for any candidate to stage a realistic challenge against the one nominated by mubarak 's ruling national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mubarak 's party holds the power over independents " the chances of elbaradei running are very slim , " dr. amr hamzawy , research director at the carnegie middle east centre in beirut , told deutsche welle .
" the constitutional restrictions introduced in the amendments of 2005 and 2007 say that independent candidates must have 250 signatures from parliamentary and local council members . " " the problem is that the ruling national democratic party holds 95 percent of the parliament and around 90 percent of council seats .
this means no independent candidate will get enough signatures .
the official , legal parties - even if they only have one seat - can field a candidate but elbaradei has said that he will not be joining a party . " elbaradei 's refusal to join a party has been part of his stance to emphasize the restrictive nature of political process and to call for the reform of the egyptian constitution to allow more competition and representation , something the ruling government has rejected . " elbaradei is understandably reluctant to run as the candidate of any of the existing opposition parties , which are all weak and many of them have been co-opted by the government and discredited with the public , " georgetown university professor michelle dunne , an expert on arab politics , told deutsche welle . " he has formed a ' front ' with other opposition figures to call for constitutional and legal changes to liberalize rules to run for the presidency .
he would need to gather a lot of popular support in egypt and international support in order to press mubarak to allow such changes .

the tradition , however , is facing extinction . the bavarian village of oberammergau is associated first and foremost with its famous easter passion plan , which takes place only once every 10 years .
the town has just 5,000 residents , but becomes a pilgrimage destination once a decade for christians from around the world . but oberammergau is also well-known for its artistic wood-sculpturing tradition ; it has an own trade school for artistic wood-work , which was established 150 years ago and is home to some 70 whittlers , who call themselves " herrgottschnitzer " -lrb- god-carvers -rrb- , since they mainly carve images of saints . rising competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herbert haseidl is one of oberammergau 's 70 traditional wood-carvers normally , local wood-carvers in oberammergau thrive on the rush of tourists during the passion plays .
but now that the carving industry has expanded , graven images are manufactured in large quantities and sold at much lower prices .
as a result , traditional carvers like herbert haseidl struggle to make a living . a wooden figure of jesus manufactured in south tyrol costs around 50 euros -lrb- $ 68 -rrb- .
haseidl , in contrast , has to charge 10 times as much for his handmade pieces to break even .
he said that " traditionally handmade " is no longer a label that attracts customers ; for many , cheap imports are just as good . most whittlers prefer to use arolla pine wood , which grows in bavaria .
but with the loss of customers , craftspeople have to cut costs where they can , so cheaper pinewoods have become common , as well . haseidl said is proud of being part of oberammergau 's wood-craft tradition , but fears that it might soon be lost . " sometimes i feel like my profession is actually dying ; especially with the economic situation we have right now , " haseidl said , adding that it 's becoming increasingly difficult to recruit young artisans . tradition and passion " my father , my grandfather and my two uncles were wood-carvers , " said haseidl .
" it was everything i knew when i was a child ; the first time i cut myself i was only four years old . " his hobby became his profession and , since 1966 , wood-craft has been haseidl 's livelihood .
today , herbert haseidl works 60 , sometimes 70 hours per week .
depending on how many orders he receives , he also works on weekends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haseidl uses 30 different carving knives for his creations every single handmade sculpture expresses haseidl 's love for what he does .
giving each one of them its individual character is most important to him . " they all have their own story , " he said .
sometimes he studies up on the lives of the saints before he sculpts them .
" if you carve religious figures but do n't stand behind the faith , they wo n't turn out . " in order to make every sculpture unique , haseidl works with great care - and with up to 30 different carving knives . " every part of the body requires special treatment : the nose , eyes and hair especially .
i even use different tools for curls and straight hair . "
in the end , every sculpture is covered with water-resistant lacquer . apart from religious images , herbert haseidl also offers secular motives , picture frames and toys .
he recently completed a miniature version of the brandenburg gate - 200 times smaller than the original - for a berlin customer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.03.2010 spanish villages vie for nuclear waste dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regions with reactors , both former and current , are ideal for the final site .
when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .
but protest have done nothing to shake the resolve of the mayor of villar de canas .
" this is all politics … no one , not technicians not politicians not anybody , has demonstrated to me that this would endanger the population , much less the environment , " jose maria saiz said .
madrid says it will make its final decision in the coming months .
for better or for worse , the project will no doubt change the prospects of one sleepy spanish town . author : mikkel larsen / tkw editor : nathan witkop nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .
but protest have done nothing to shake the resolve of the mayor of villar de canas .
" this is all politics … no one , not technicians not politicians not anybody , has demonstrated to me that this would endanger the population , much less the environment , " jose maria saiz said .
madrid says it will make its final decision in the coming months .
for better or for worse , the project will no doubt change the prospects of one sleepy spanish town . author : mikkel larsen / tkw editor : nathan witkop nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "
unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .
pressure from all sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these placards call on the government to cut military spending instead while the greek public calls on the government to soften its cost-cutting plans , the european union argues they do n't go far enough .
greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .
prime minister george papandreou has said he has " sympathy " for the strikers , but insists there is simply " no money " for any other course of action. msh / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .

ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .

specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .

westerwelle 's diplomatic trips großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle dismissed the claims as a ' personal attack ' as guido westerwelle wraps up his trip through south america , the foreign minister is accused of pursuing personal interests in choosing his accompanying business delegation .
but how are these delegations really chosen ? foreign minister guido westerwelle has faced extensive allegations of combining his official diplomatic trips with personal business interests .
on friday , members of several opposition parties vehemently criticized the minister for bringing a business partner of his brother on a diplomatic trip to asia in january , saying he had made the choice based more on his own interests than those of germany .
" westerwelle is damaging the federal republic , he is damaging the image of the foreign ministry , " said renate kuenast , a senior figure in the green party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is under fire for bringing his partner -lrb- left -rrb- in connection with his latest whirlwind journey to south america , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , westerwelle was criticized for bringing along his life partner , michael mronz , who was allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
german chancellor angela merkel came out in defense of westerwelle and his selection of business delegations that have accompanied him on past diplomatic journeys , saying she was " confident that the foreign minister 's selections were in full compliance with the rules , " according to a statement from berlin on friday .
how the process works but the controversy surrounding westerwelle 's business delegations begs the question : how does the german foreign ministry choose which business representatives travel on official diplomatic journeys ?
according to spokesman stefan bredohl , when the foreign ministry announces the planning of a trip , the german embassy in the host country puts together a list of economic areas of interest in that country and sends it to berlin .
particular emphasis , says bredohl , is placed on regions where " significant projects - such as renewable energy , as was the case in china - are already in place where german companies can then further economic development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media has made a big deal of who travels with the foreign minister the foreign ministry then consults the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- to create a list of some 60 companies that could accompany the foreign minister .
westerwelle has the final say which companies can send a representative to travel with him ; in most cases , his business delegation consists of between 10 and 20 representatives .
customary practice according to professor thomas fischer , a political scientist at the brussels office of the bertelsman foundation , the delegations that accompany german diplomatic trips are " very similar " to those of other countries .
fischer added that westerwelle 's " handpicking " of business representatives was " nothing new , " and that " if foreign ministers could n't choose the people they brought with them on their diplomatic journeys , this would be a disservice to both the german government and economy . "
" merkel , schroeder , steinmeier , they all formed their entourages themselves , " fischer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder also brought whomever he wanted , says fischer " in principle , there is nothing wrong with lobbyism , or with governments being accompanied by strategically chosen representatives .
the question is , and i think this is relevant in the westerwelle issue , is whether the representatives are actually strategically chosen , " he added .
westerwelle fights back the allegations facing westerwelle are indeed not based on whether he was pursuing economic interests on his trips , which has been the case in the past with his pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but rather that he was pursuing merely personal interests .
westerwelle strongly denied all claims against him on friday and accused those who made the allegations of attempting to defame him and his family .
he added that all delegations he has brought with him since becoming foreign minister late last year " fully deserved to represent germany and its economic interests abroad . "

speaking to reporters in frankfurt after the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- board vote , zwanziger expressed contentment with the outcome .
" i am very satisfied and was happy about the confidence from the board , " he said .
" despite the problems , i still really want to do this job . "
zwanziger was caught up in a scandal that has rocked the dfb and had led him to consider resigning over the matter .
the dfb last month confirmed allegations by four referees that manfred amerell , a former member of the association 's referee panel , had sexually harassed them .
the association has since also passed the referees ' statements on to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amerell has strongly denied he sexually harassed anyone amerell has strongly denied the allegations , and has sued michael kempter , one of the four complaining referees .
the dfb has also sued amerell for defamation in reference to comments he made this week heavily criticizing zwanziger 's conduct .
support across the board reports in the german media of zwanziger considering resignation led several of his colleagues to come to his support .
bundesliga president reinhard rauball said the soccer league was " 100 percent behind what zwanziger has done , " and dfb board member franz beckenbauer said the case was not worth resigning over .
asked if zwanziger had made mistakes in handling the scandal , beckenbauer said it was a " tricky situation . "
" maybe the dfb would have been better advised to hand this affair over to prosecutors immediately , but that can be absolutely no reason for zwanziger to resign , " he said .

the times when investors pumped millions into young companies are over , and the aspirations of german entrepreneurs have become much more modest . so you want to work hard for two years and make millions ?
in recent years , many young it companies have managed to turn this dream into reality : think of facebook , ebay or amazon , whose founders made a fortune .
but times have changed and the global economic crisis has hit the international start-up scene .
the equation is simple : no investors equals no huge start-ups .
for most young entrepreneurs in the german it sector the future is not about becoming a millionaire , it 's about surviving .
according to a survey by financial magazine wirtschaftswoche , every fifth german start-up was close to bankruptcy in 2009 .

while this may seem like a great idea , investors did not think so in 2009 .
wandel lost existing client contacts and banks refused to give her a loan .
" it was really hard , i had put all my effort into my ideas , " she said .
wandel did what most desperate business people do in these difficult times : she launched her company with what little money she had .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wandel developed a new web-based market research strategy " it 's a misperception that someone gives you the money to create what you want to create .

" you need to show what you have to get an investor , " said thierhoff .
" people nowadays invest later and they look a lot more into the business model than they used to . "
a lot of german copycats it also seems that german start-ups need to be more creative to create a hit than in years past .
the german web community studivz is an example of halcyon days long passed .
the enthusiasm surrounding its launch and initial success gave way to accusations that it was just a copy of its american counterpart facebook , but not before it was sold for an alleged 100 million euros -lrb- $ 136 million -rrb- to the publisher holtzbrinck .
" there were a lot of copycats out there , " said thierhoff .
while the alleged copy appears to have worked for the founders of studivz , analysts say that holtzbrinck 's massive investment is unlikely to pay off .

herrmann has created a web platform where university students can exchange notes taken at lectures - helpful for those students who missed a class due to illness or simply do n't want to go .
it 's an online community , but every set of notes has a small price that provides hermann 's company unidog with a couple of cents .
both wandel and herrmann are hoping that their start-ups will become a hit in 2010 , and both have chosen projects that are not affected by the economic crisis .
herrmann targets students who might still have a spare euro or two for university lecture notes , while wandel tries to convince her customers that her new method of fragrance research can save them a lot of money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.03.2010 spanish villages vie for nuclear waste dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regions with reactors , both former and current , are ideal for the final site .
when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .

when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .
but protest have done nothing to shake the resolve of the mayor of villar de canas .
" this is all politics … no one , not technicians not politicians not anybody , has demonstrated to me that this would endanger the population , much less the environment , " jose maria saiz said .
madrid says it will make its final decision in the coming months .

read on for tips on spending money in germany . germany introduced the euro in 2001 .
one euro is approximately equal to $ 1.35 , 1.62 australian dollars , and 0.67 british pounds . the euro was designed for societies accustomed to carrying coin purses and paying cash and has a plethora of coins in different denominations : two euros , one euro , 50 cents , 20 cents , 10 cents , five cents , two cents and one cent . the best way to avoid paying expensive exchange fees is to withdraw cash directly from an atm -lrb- look for a bankautomat or geldautomat -rrb- .
before you go , ask your home bank if it charges a fee for using an atm abroad . it is also possible to change money or cash travellers ' cheques at any bank for a fee . paying with a credit card is not common .
most germans simply carry cash or pay with a debit card .
larger department stores and hotels accept credit cards , but smaller shops and restaurants generally do not .
restaurants and cafes never take credit cards and many do n't accept debit cards either .
it is a good idea to keep cash on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most restaurants only take cash tax is always included on the price tag .
what you see is what you pay .
in january 2007 , value-added tax was raised from 16 to 19 percent .
for selected items like books and food , tax is only 7 percent . many stores , especially grocery stores , do not give out bags for their customers ' purchases .
employing someone to bag groceries is unheard of .
bags are usually available for purchase , however many shoppers bring their own re-usable shopping bag with them . when purchasing beverages , keep in mind that most glass and plastic bottles have a " pfand " or deposit , ranging between 0.08 and 0.25 euros .
it 's a good idea to return the bottle to the same supermarket chain you purchased it at , as there are some restrictions on which bottles they refund . business hours most stores in germany open during the week at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. and close between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.
they tend to close earlier on saturday , sometimes as early as 2 p.m.
in larger cities , many shops will stay open from monday through saturday until 8 p.m. , with some open until 10 p.m. some shops close for lunch , generally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.
this is more common in smaller towns , but may also be the case in larger cities as well . nearly all stores are closed on sundays and public holidays .
for urgent necessities , however , you can go to a gas station convenience store .
some bakeries and flower shops also open for a few hours on sundays .
another important exception is train stations in larger cities .
shops within the station often open on sundays , and sometimes on public holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmacies are marked with a giant " a " for " apotheke " pharmacies if you enjoyed a bit too much of germany 's most famous beverage , you wo n't find an aspirin in the supermarket or the drug store - and most certainly not on a sunday .
over-the-counter medications , such as pain-killers , are only sold in pharmacies , not in supermarkets or drug stores . pharmacies are very common in germany , so you will not have trouble finding one .
it 's not a good idea to go overboard on a saturday night , because only selected pharmacies are opened on sundays .
these are generally listed in the newspaper .
the pharmacies that are closed on sunday will also post a listing of those in the area that are opened . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - lifestyle europe we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .
it 's also very important to look each person at the table in the eye while you chink glasses with them .
-lrb- according to local myth , those who drop their eyes are destined to seven years of bad sex . -rrb- in germany , kids are allowed to drink beer and wine from the age of 16 .
they can drink hard liquor once they 're 18 . unless you look like a pre-adolescent , it 's very unlikely you will be asked to show identification .
also , drinking in public is legal in germany , so do n't be surprised if you see the occasional sidewalk drinker - without a paper bag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't leave money on the table , always pay the server directly paying in most restaurants and cafes , tipping is optional .
it 's customary to round up the bill , or tip approximately five to 10 percent .
for example , if the bill is 2.80 euros , give the server 3.00 euros .
if the bill comes to 22.40 euros , give 25.00 euros .
if you were very happy with the service give more . if you have the correct change , say , " stimmt so . "
if you would like change back , say the total amount you would like to pay . be aware that most restaurants do not accept credit cards , so make sure you have enough cash before you go out to eat . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures beer , beer , beer 07 dw-tv europe live journal - news with interview we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .
it 's also very important to look each person at the table in the eye while you chink glasses with them .
-lrb- according to local myth , those who drop their eyes are destined to seven years of bad sex . -rrb- in germany , kids are allowed to drink beer and wine from the age of 16 .
they can drink hard liquor once they 're 18 . unless you look like a pre-adolescent , it 's very unlikely you will be asked to show identification .
also , drinking in public is legal in germany , so do n't be surprised if you see the occasional sidewalk drinker - without a paper bag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't leave money on the table , always pay the server directly paying in most restaurants and cafes , tipping is optional .
it 's customary to round up the bill , or tip approximately five to 10 percent .
for example , if the bill is 2.80 euros , give the server 3.00 euros .
if the bill comes to 22.40 euros , give 25.00 euros .
if you were very happy with the service give more . if you have the correct change , say , " stimmt so . "
if you would like change back , say the total amount you would like to pay . be aware that most restaurants do not accept credit cards , so make sure you have enough cash before you go out to eat . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures beer , beer , beer feedback tell us about your experiences dining out in germany .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .
you may find separate disposal areas for glass , paper and packaging .

it 's also a great way to take in the landscape - or catch up on some sleep after your long-haul flight to germany . tickets are cheaper the earlier you book them .
if you book a round-trip journey on a specific day and train at least three days in advance , you are eligible for a discount , subject to availability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : book your train trip in advance for better fares children up to 14 years travel for free when accompanied by a parent or grandparent .
the number of children traveling must be included on the ticket .
groups of six or more can save as much as 70 percent , depending on how early they book . it is possible to purchase train tickets online at www.bahn.de and print them out yourself .
you can also buy them in advance or last-minute at any train station , either at the counter or at a ticket vending machine . on long-distance trains , it is possible to purchase tickets from the conductor per cash or credit card , but you have to pay an extra fee .
regional trains may have a ticket machine on board , but not necessarily .
it is advisable to purchase your ticket beforehand in the station . reserving a seat is a good idea if you are traveling at peak times -lrb- weekends , rush hour , or holidays -rrb- or if you have a lot of luggage with you .
it costs 1.50 euros -lrb- $ 2 -rrb- per direction .
your reservation voucher will indicate a car number and a seat number .
there will be a sign at the track indicating where on the track your reserved car will stop . for train schedules and detailed price information , visit the deutsche bahn web site at www.bahn.de. trains are categorized by the distance they travel and the level of comfort they offer , which can all mean a big difference in price .
not all tickets are good for all trains . ice : intercity-express these are germany 's fastest long-distance trains and are generally more expensive .
they offer luxury services on board like laptop hook-ups and audio and visual entertainment .
ice trains only stop at bigger stations . ic / ec : intercity and eurocity the ic trains link major cities in germany , while the eurocity trains connect germany with major cities in neighboring european countries . rb : regional trains these trains service shorter routes within germany and generally make more frequent stops . thalys : paris - brussels - amsterdam - cologne this high-speed train connects cologne to paris in 4 hours -lrb- 3 hours in 2008 -rrb- . cheap flights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes flying can be the least expensive way to travel discount airlines are more common in europe than in the us .
if you 're lucky enough to snag a good deal , flying from a to b can be both quicker and cheaper than traveling by train or even by car . some airlines advertise inter-european flights as cheap as 19 euros -lrb- $ 26 -rrb- .
these prices are subject to availability , however .
the earlier you book , the more likely you are to find a good deal .
when looking on the internet , be sure to check for taxes and fees - which can quickly quadruple the price of the actual flight . want to book an inter-european flight ?

those who stay in germany for longer than six months must apply for a german license . it is not usually necessary to carry an international driver 's license , although it serves as an additional form of identification and proof that you hold a valid driver 's license in your country .

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .
it 's also very important to look each person at the table in the eye while you chink glasses with them .
-lrb- according to local myth , those who drop their eyes are destined to seven years of bad sex . -rrb- in germany , kids are allowed to drink beer and wine from the age of 16 .
they can drink hard liquor once they 're 18 . unless you look like a pre-adolescent , it 's very unlikely you will be asked to show identification .
also , drinking in public is legal in germany , so do n't be surprised if you see the occasional sidewalk drinker - without a paper bag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't leave money on the table , always pay the server directly paying in most restaurants and cafes , tipping is optional .
it 's customary to round up the bill , or tip approximately five to 10 percent .
for example , if the bill is 2.80 euros , give the server 3.00 euros .
if the bill comes to 22.40 euros , give 25.00 euros .
if you were very happy with the service give more . if you have the correct change , say , " stimmt so . "
if you would like change back , say the total amount you would like to pay . be aware that most restaurants do not accept credit cards , so make sure you have enough cash before you go out to eat . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures beer , beer , beer 07 dw-tv europe live deutschland heute - das deutschlandmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

before you go , ask your home bank if it charges a fee for using an atm abroad . it is also possible to change money or cash travellers ' cheques at any bank for a fee . paying with a credit card is not common .
most germans simply carry cash or pay with a debit card .
larger department stores and hotels accept credit cards , but smaller shops and restaurants generally do not .
restaurants and cafes never take credit cards and many do n't accept debit cards either .

bags are usually available for purchase , however many shoppers bring their own re-usable shopping bag with them . when purchasing beverages , keep in mind that most glass and plastic bottles have a " pfand " or deposit , ranging between 0.08 and 0.25 euros .
it 's a good idea to return the bottle to the same supermarket chain you purchased it at , as there are some restrictions on which bottles they refund . business hours most stores in germany open during the week at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. and close between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

on the third annual ' world day against cyber censorship ' reporters without borders has again warned of growing surveillance . the latest study by reporters without borders identified 12 " enemies of the internet " - especially in asia and the arab world .
among them are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran .
" in those countries control and surveillance of the world wide web is so strict that the internet is in fact more of an intranet , " says anja viohl , spokesperson of reporters without borders , an international organization fighting for press freedom .
china steps up its control it 's in those countries that bloggers and dissidents who use the internet are subject to repression and censorship .
china leads the way in terms of the technical effort and sophistication the authorities put into censoring online content . the country also has the largest online community with around 380 million users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google threatened to leave china after hacker attacks in january , us internet giant google had threatened to withdraw from the chinese market altogether .
the move came after hackers targeted google 's chinese service .
so far it 's not yet clear who was behind the attacks - the chinese government denies any involvement .
but regardless of whether or not beijing is responsible - there is little doubt that access to foreign websites is significantly limited across china .
sealing off the internet " the censorship by the communist government now affects almost all foreign web sites .
if you do n't actually have a chinese web address , then you 're likely to be entirely blocked so no one in china can access the site , " said adrienne woltersdorf , head of the chinese department at deutsche welle .
access to deutsche welle 's websites is strongly affected by the country 's censorship .
other international broadcasters like the bbc , voice of america and radio free asia have the same problem .
not only is critical news being blocked out , but competition on the media market is also significantly affected .
the us is currently considering taking china to court at the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- over censorship issues .
bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have identified 12 ' enemies of the internet ' - especially in asia and the arab world .
among those are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran surveilling , scanning , blocking behind china 's policy of censorship there is a sophisticated mechanism of control .
experts assume that around 40,000 state employees are keeping a close eye on the web .
all chinese e-mail traffic is copied and then scanned for sensitive words like " tianamen " - the same mechanism is used for scanning web sites .
according to reporters without borders , around 60 countries censored public access to the internet in 2009 .
there are some surprises in this list - countries like australia or south korea who have stepped up surveillance of the internet to combat child pornography .
globally some 120 bloggers and dissidents are under arrest for things they wrote on the internet .
deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf said a new approach was needed even in countries where freedom of speech is not infringed .
" the western world has to very carefully consider how to deal with regimes that so bluntly and systematically block free access to information on the internent . "

when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .
but protest have done nothing to shake the resolve of the mayor of villar de canas .
" this is all politics … no one , not technicians not politicians not anybody , has demonstrated to me that this would endanger the population , much less the environment , " jose maria saiz said .
madrid says it will make its final decision in the coming months .
for better or for worse , the project will no doubt change the prospects of one sleepy spanish town . author : mikkel larsen / tkw editor : nathan witkop nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they have very little representation in parliament , their work and ability to reach out effectively to constituencies has been heavily restricted since the state of emergency came into power in 1981 and they have failed to convince egyptians that they have a solid platform and policies . " " the opposition is splintered along an ideological divide , between islamists and secularists and its potential power has been stripped by constant in-fighting .
those who are in a position of relative power are there because they have struck a deal with the government ; they agree to limit their reach in return for a guaranteed percentage of seats . " mubarak remains cagey as mouthpieces take aim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mubarak lets his subordinates and cronies do the talking president mubarak has yet to publicly respond to elbaradei 's government-baiting and claims of a lack of democracy in egypt .
earlier this month while in germany for an operation to remove his gall bladder , mubarak said that elbaradei was welcome to run for president as long as he respected the constitution . but the president bristled when asked in the same news conference whether elbaradei was a national hero .
" we do not need a national hero , here or there , " the president said . while mubarak himself refuses to openly criticise the former diplomat and iaea chief , his government and media mouthpieces have been taking aim .
osama saraya , editor of the government 's flagship daily newspaper al-ahram , has accused elbaradei of being " ill-informed " and " an american stooge " while minister of state for legal and parliamentary affairs moufid shehab said elbaradei was out of touch and knew nothing about the challenges facing today 's egypt . not all opposition groups have joined behind elbaradei either .
the muslim brotherhood , egypt 's largest opposition group , has announced it would not support him .
" those who support elbaradei are an elitist bloc with no roots in the egyptian street , " senior brotherhood leader mohammed habib wrote in the independent newspaper al-masry al-youm . observers talk up potential dynastic succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of military background may count against gamal it is still not clear whether mubarak will stand again in 2011 with some observers believing he will hand power to his son gamal in the hope of creating a dynasty , a move which may add weight to elbaradei 's claims that egypt has been following the pattern of pharaoic regimes for the past 7,000 years . " of course the amendments made to the constitution and the limitations placed on independent candidates for the presidency have been put in place by mubarak to protect his rule and keep the power within his regime , " hamzawy said . " now his son gamal is being groomed , it looks as though this will continue .
i personally believe that hosni mubarak , if his health holds , will run for a sixth term . " if gamal , who heads the policy secretariat of the ruling national democratic party , is not named as mubarak 's successor , egypt 's intelligence chief omar suleiman , a close aide to the president , is the next most likely candidate . " mubarak knows that there is a certain amount of opposition to his plans for a dynastic solution to the succession question and knows that it would be difficult for him to anoint gamal should he decide not to run himself , " almut moeller , a middle east expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . egypt faces an uncertain future moeller believes that the political instruments mubarak has installed during nearly 30 years of rule can almost guarantee that his party and regime will continue to run egypt after 2011 .
what is less clear is the future the country will face after the next presidential election . " if egypt gets more of the same in terms of a ruling government , it 's very hard to say how egyptians will react , " moeller said .
" there has been a growing opposition movement and unease within egyptian society for some time now .
if there is an eruption , a revolt , then it is very hard to say how the regime would respond to that . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it does n't seem to matter that the next presidential election is over a year away or that potential reformist leaders are wildly celebrated despite not being legally allowed to run for office .
it appears that a slim chance is better than none at all .
the reception afforded mohammed elbaradei on his homecoming to cairo last week seemed to sum up the mood of many who have grown up under mubarak 's increasingly oppressive and divisive leadership .
rapturous crowds of thousands welcomed elbaradei , many inspired by the calls from egypt 's normally moribund opposition figures for him to run against mubarak in 2011 , if the 81-year-old incumbent decides to stand again .
the reaction to elbaradei 's return also smacked of desperation .
the nobel peace prize laureate is officially banned under egypt 's constitution from running for president .
amendments to the constitution passed in 2005 and 2007 prohibit him from doing so , a fact well-known among the celebrating masses .
and yet , he was still welcomed as a national hero and saviour .
while neither counting himself in nor ruling himself out , elbaradei has certainly stirred up debate over the future of egypt , a country that has a history of strongly suppressing dissent and criticism of the president and his methods .

claiming that 99 percent of egyptians want their country to head in a new direction , elbaradei has also begun rallying " the poor and the rich , the young and the old … women wearing the niqab , the hijab , or not veiled at all ; intellectuals ; peasants ; people of all ages and classes . "
but much like us president barack obama , elbaradei has made it clear that he does not want to be seen as a saviour .
however , just as huge expectations pushed obama to the white house , it may already be too late .
" elbaradei has become the symbol of the hope for change for millions of egyptians , " novelist alaa al-aswani told reporters on tuesday .
government restrictions make candidacy near impossible despite the growing movement behind elbaradei , analysts say election rules make it almost impossible for any candidate to stage a realistic challenge against the one nominated by mubarak 's ruling national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mubarak 's party holds the power over independents " the chances of elbaradei running are very slim , " dr. amr hamzawy , research director at the carnegie middle east centre in beirut , told deutsche welle .
" the constitutional restrictions introduced in the amendments of 2005 and 2007 say that independent candidates must have 250 signatures from parliamentary and local council members . " " the problem is that the ruling national democratic party holds 95 percent of the parliament and around 90 percent of council seats .
this means no independent candidate will get enough signatures .
the official , legal parties - even if they only have one seat - can field a candidate but elbaradei has said that he will not be joining a party . " elbaradei 's refusal to join a party has been part of his stance to emphasize the restrictive nature of political process and to call for the reform of the egyptian constitution to allow more competition and representation , something the ruling government has rejected . " elbaradei is understandably reluctant to run as the candidate of any of the existing opposition parties , which are all weak and many of them have been co-opted by the government and discredited with the public , " georgetown university professor michelle dunne , an expert on arab politics , told deutsche welle . " he has formed a ' front ' with other opposition figures to call for constitutional and legal changes to liberalize rules to run for the presidency .
he would need to gather a lot of popular support in egypt and international support in order to press mubarak to allow such changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 12.03.2010 six of the best : germany 's f1 hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumi and co are in bahrain for the first race of 2010 germany is threatening to monopolize the formula one grid nowadays , with no fewer than six drivers - that 's one quarter of the entire field - competing at bahrain this weekend .
dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .

when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2010 german it-start-ups hope for better times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes more creativity to get an internet business going these days the finance crisis has hit young it start-ups in germany hard .
the times when investors pumped millions into young companies are over , and the aspirations of german entrepreneurs have become much more modest . so you want to work hard for two years and make millions ?
in recent years , many young it companies have managed to turn this dream into reality : think of facebook , ebay or amazon , whose founders made a fortune .
but times have changed and the global economic crisis has hit the international start-up scene .
the equation is simple : no investors equals no huge start-ups .
for most young entrepreneurs in the german it sector the future is not about becoming a millionaire , it 's about surviving .
according to a survey by financial magazine wirtschaftswoche , every fifth german start-up was close to bankruptcy in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : start-up consultant kai thierhoff from cologne says it 's a tough world out there " things have become a little harder , " kai thierhoff , an it consultant from cologne , told deutsche welle .
" people have stopped investing in young companies . "
investors want to see results before paying ingrid wandel is one of the entrepreneurs who had to face this new reality firsthand .
she developed a new way to find out how people think about fragrances - ideal for beauty product companies .
until now , wandel says , market research on fragrances was difficult and costly .
her small business fragloom tries to solve this problem by showing respondents online pictures meant to express how they might feel about a certain fragrance .
while this may seem like a great idea , investors did not think so in 2009 .
wandel lost existing client contacts and banks refused to give her a loan .
" it was really hard , i had put all my effort into my ideas , " she said .
wandel did what most desperate business people do in these difficult times : she launched her company with what little money she had .
now she believes she will make it , having signed contracts for new projects in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wandel developed a new web-based market research strategy " it 's a misperception that someone gives you the money to create what you want to create .
that 's not the case , " said consultant kai thierhoff , before explaining that the trick is to get the company running first and look for investors later .
" you need to show what you have to get an investor , " said thierhoff .
" people nowadays invest later and they look a lot more into the business model than they used to . "
a lot of german copycats it also seems that german start-ups need to be more creative to create a hit than in years past .
the german web community studivz is an example of halcyon days long passed .
the enthusiasm surrounding its launch and initial success gave way to accusations that it was just a copy of its american counterpart facebook , but not before it was sold for an alleged 100 million euros -lrb- $ 136 million -rrb- to the publisher holtzbrinck .
" there were a lot of copycats out there , " said thierhoff .
while the alleged copy appears to have worked for the founders of studivz , analysts say that holtzbrinck 's massive investment is unlikely to pay off .
" it 's not about web traffic anymore , it 's about sales , " thierhoff said , adding that the days when web communities seemed to be launched daily are long gone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-guenther herrmann has rather modest plans twenty-five-year-old hans-guenther herrmann is one young entrepreneurs who has adapted to the new business environment .
he is not financed by an investor , but through a german government grant .
and he wants to " start things small , " rather than landing that infamous million-euro sale as soon as possible .
herrmann has created a web platform where university students can exchange notes taken at lectures - helpful for those students who missed a class due to illness or simply do n't want to go .
it 's an online community , but every set of notes has a small price that provides hermann 's company unidog with a couple of cents .
both wandel and herrmann are hoping that their start-ups will become a hit in 2010 , and both have chosen projects that are not affected by the economic crisis .
herrmann targets students who might still have a spare euro or two for university lecture notes , while wandel tries to convince her customers that her new method of fragrance research can save them a lot of money .
it 's not clear whether either of them will succeed .
but for the chance to make it big , they 're willing to risk failure .

the times when investors pumped millions into young companies are over , and the aspirations of german entrepreneurs have become much more modest . so you want to work hard for two years and make millions ?
in recent years , many young it companies have managed to turn this dream into reality : think of facebook , ebay or amazon , whose founders made a fortune .
but times have changed and the global economic crisis has hit the international start-up scene .
the equation is simple : no investors equals no huge start-ups .
for most young entrepreneurs in the german it sector the future is not about becoming a millionaire , it 's about surviving .
according to a survey by financial magazine wirtschaftswoche , every fifth german start-up was close to bankruptcy in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : start-up consultant kai thierhoff from cologne says it 's a tough world out there " things have become a little harder , " kai thierhoff , an it consultant from cologne , told deutsche welle .
" people have stopped investing in young companies . "
investors want to see results before paying ingrid wandel is one of the entrepreneurs who had to face this new reality firsthand .
she developed a new way to find out how people think about fragrances - ideal for beauty product companies .
until now , wandel says , market research on fragrances was difficult and costly .
her small business fragloom tries to solve this problem by showing respondents online pictures meant to express how they might feel about a certain fragrance .
while this may seem like a great idea , investors did not think so in 2009 .
wandel lost existing client contacts and banks refused to give her a loan .
" it was really hard , i had put all my effort into my ideas , " she said .
wandel did what most desperate business people do in these difficult times : she launched her company with what little money she had .
now she believes she will make it , having signed contracts for new projects in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wandel developed a new web-based market research strategy " it 's a misperception that someone gives you the money to create what you want to create .
that 's not the case , " said consultant kai thierhoff , before explaining that the trick is to get the company running first and look for investors later .
" you need to show what you have to get an investor , " said thierhoff .
" people nowadays invest later and they look a lot more into the business model than they used to . "
a lot of german copycats it also seems that german start-ups need to be more creative to create a hit than in years past .
the german web community studivz is an example of halcyon days long passed .
the enthusiasm surrounding its launch and initial success gave way to accusations that it was just a copy of its american counterpart facebook , but not before it was sold for an alleged 100 million euros -lrb- $ 136 million -rrb- to the publisher holtzbrinck .
" there were a lot of copycats out there , " said thierhoff .
while the alleged copy appears to have worked for the founders of studivz , analysts say that holtzbrinck 's massive investment is unlikely to pay off .
" it 's not about web traffic anymore , it 's about sales , " thierhoff said , adding that the days when web communities seemed to be launched daily are long gone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-guenther herrmann has rather modest plans twenty-five-year-old hans-guenther herrmann is one young entrepreneurs who has adapted to the new business environment .
he is not financed by an investor , but through a german government grant .
and he wants to " start things small , " rather than landing that infamous million-euro sale as soon as possible .
herrmann has created a web platform where university students can exchange notes taken at lectures - helpful for those students who missed a class due to illness or simply do n't want to go .
it 's an online community , but every set of notes has a small price that provides hermann 's company unidog with a couple of cents .
both wandel and herrmann are hoping that their start-ups will become a hit in 2010 , and both have chosen projects that are not affected by the economic crisis .
herrmann targets students who might still have a spare euro or two for university lecture notes , while wandel tries to convince her customers that her new method of fragrance research can save them a lot of money .
it 's not clear whether either of them will succeed .
but for the chance to make it big , they 're willing to risk failure .

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "
this year 's conference is scheduled for may 17. acb / dpa / kna / epd editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the third annual ' world day against cyber censorship ' reporters without borders has again warned of growing surveillance . the latest study by reporters without borders identified 12 " enemies of the internet " - especially in asia and the arab world .
among them are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran .
" in those countries control and surveillance of the world wide web is so strict that the internet is in fact more of an intranet , " says anja viohl , spokesperson of reporters without borders , an international organization fighting for press freedom .
china steps up its control it 's in those countries that bloggers and dissidents who use the internet are subject to repression and censorship .
china leads the way in terms of the technical effort and sophistication the authorities put into censoring online content . the country also has the largest online community with around 380 million users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google threatened to leave china after hacker attacks in january , us internet giant google had threatened to withdraw from the chinese market altogether .
the move came after hackers targeted google 's chinese service .
so far it 's not yet clear who was behind the attacks - the chinese government denies any involvement .
but regardless of whether or not beijing is responsible - there is little doubt that access to foreign websites is significantly limited across china .
sealing off the internet " the censorship by the communist government now affects almost all foreign web sites .
if you do n't actually have a chinese web address , then you 're likely to be entirely blocked so no one in china can access the site , " said adrienne woltersdorf , head of the chinese department at deutsche welle .
access to deutsche welle 's websites is strongly affected by the country 's censorship .
other international broadcasters like the bbc , voice of america and radio free asia have the same problem .
not only is critical news being blocked out , but competition on the media market is also significantly affected .
the us is currently considering taking china to court at the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- over censorship issues .
bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have identified 12 ' enemies of the internet ' - especially in asia and the arab world .
among those are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran surveilling , scanning , blocking behind china 's policy of censorship there is a sophisticated mechanism of control .
experts assume that around 40,000 state employees are keeping a close eye on the web .
all chinese e-mail traffic is copied and then scanned for sensitive words like " tianamen " - the same mechanism is used for scanning web sites .
according to reporters without borders , around 60 countries censored public access to the internet in 2009 .
there are some surprises in this list - countries like australia or south korea who have stepped up surveillance of the internet to combat child pornography .
globally some 120 bloggers and dissidents are under arrest for things they wrote on the internet .
deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf said a new approach was needed even in countries where freedom of speech is not infringed .
" the western world has to very carefully consider how to deal with regimes that so bluntly and systematically block free access to information on the internent . "

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 12.03.2010 traffickers use voodoo to threaten nigerian victims into prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are forced to take oaths they believe will bring disaster upon them if broken german federal police say they have noticed a disturbing new trend in human trafficking .
some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "
unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .
pressure from all sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these placards call on the government to cut military spending instead while the greek public calls on the government to soften its cost-cutting plans , the european union argues they do n't go far enough .
greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .
prime minister george papandreou has said he has " sympathy " for the strikers , but insists there is simply " no money " for any other course of action. msh / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .

ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .

but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .

both use art to examine the impact of dictatorship . the schauspielhaus in cologne was packed as herta mueller and ai weiwei walked out onto the stage to rapturous applause . petite and elegantly-dressed in black , the winner of the 2009 nobel prize for literature radiated a sharp intelligence and a timid warmth .
beside her , the artist in his trademark casual clothes appeared bearlike but in no way did this friendly giant overshadow his interlocutor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german writer herta mueller won the nobel prize for literature in 2009 although they come from very different countries , the two artists are bound by their similar background , their courage and their sharp and constant criticism of totalitarianism . chinese cigarettes and romanian songs as young people , they were also brought together by the good relations between their two countries , which herta mueller recalled with humor .
" we always had chinese cigarettes .
i think there were five kinds , " she said with a smile . " they were the best , especially compared to the romanian ones .
the good romanian tobacco was exported .
once i walked in front of a chemist ’ s , which were usually empty , and there were glass eyes in the window .
glass eyes of all sizes and all colors .
they looked good ! " herta mueller turned her brown glass eye into a necklace , eliciting a range of responses from those around her in drab , communist romania . the romania that she knew was not the country ai weiwei dreamed of in another village thousands of miles away .
" i am happy to hear how multi-faceted china ’ s support of romania was at the time , " he told the writer with his trademark irony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei used an interpreter at the event " as you were admiring chinese glass eyes at the chemist 's , we were watching romanian films .
we thought the songs in romanian films were extremely romantic .
if we could sing them , we could capture any young girl 's heart . " however , it was not glass eyes and movies that linked china and romania most but a shared ideology . ' catastrophe for humanity ' the son of a once-revered poet who was banished into exile and forced to clean toilets during the cultural revolution , ai weiwei uses photography , video art and installations to criticize the chinese state today .
he is by no means duped by his country 's economic development . " it is certain that we live in an absolutely totalitarian state and this state does not want to give up its power structures , " he told the audience in cologne .
" this country has over a fifth of the world 's population and is trading in all directions with the world .
some say this country is the hope for the future .
i say very clearly that if this system continues to exist in this form , it will spell out catastrophe for humanity . " asked if there could be any hope at all , he assured his listeners he lived in daily hope that new technologies , especially the internet , would change the situation and bring democracy to china . for her part , herta mueller questioned whether the internet could serve as a platform for political resistance .
her fear was that the authorities in china or iran are so arrogant that they do not care if people at home or abroad know about their crimes . but ai weiwei refused to give up hope , arguing that a flicker of light in the darkness of totalitarianism was better than nothing at all . in pursuit of truth about sichuan earthquake it is this dogged optimism that drives his art and activism .
in cologne , he showed photos that he had made of the devastation wreaked by the earthquake that rocked sichuan on may 12 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei and herta mueller look at a list of the 5,200 schoolchildren who died in the sichuan earthquake of 2008 " after all the pain , all the donations , the state has not fulfilled its promise and has not investigated the sub-standard school buildings , " said ai weiwei .
" when we wanted to find out how many children had died , the state told us we were spies and we were spying for the american imperialists .
as an artist , i thought i would look for the children who had disappeared myself .
it is our responsibility . " he and dozens of volunteers - 30 of whom were later arrested by the police who confiscated their data - found out the names and dates of birth of 5,200 children who had died .
tellingly , they also discovered that they were pupils in only 20 schools out of 1,000 schools in the area - 20 schools that were probably not built according to the regulations , although this has not been proven . the list of children who died in the sichuan earthquake covers one whole wall of ai weiwei ’ s massive studio in beijing .
in cologne , the picture of this wall brought an awed silence into the room . secret police an integral part of authoritarian regimes another picture that ai weiwei showed , describing it as his best photographic work so far , was of him in a lift with two police officers that were tailing him , none too subtly .
he took the photo with his mobile phone and immediately posted it on the internet . as one of the most famous of china ’ s dissidents , ai weiwei enjoys a certain degree of protection but it takes courage to confront ones " minders " in such a way . herta mueller can very much empathize with ai weiwei 's experiences of being spied upon or accused of spying for the west .
in her novels and essays , she criticizes the securitate , romania 's secret police , and depicts the atmosphere of fear , humiliation , and distrust that prevailed in communist romania . " this immediate accusation of spying is so typical .
i think it exists in every dictatorship .
if we look at cuba or iran , they always say people are working under the influence of external powers .
i heard it all the time .
at a factory that i worked in , people would say ' so-and-so is a cia agent . '
they didn ’ t even know what cia stood for ! " she said . the greatest accusation was that a person was too individualistic , lacked collective spirit and did not display a socialist attitude .
both ai weiwei and herta mueller fell prey to this accusation but it did not stop them from taking refuge in art and literature to nurture their individuality . herta mueller saw romania ’ s brutal regime fall .
ai weiwei hopes he too will see china 's one-party system fall . author : anne thomas editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .
heavy regulation in the energy market often translates to market values of grids being much lower than regulated values .
the grid serves about 18 million people in eastern and northern germany and covers 9,700 kilometers of high-voltage lines .
the sale increases elia 's holdings to 143,000 square kilometers serving 29 million customers .
utilities across europe have sold off lucrative but state-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable energy markets , where limited competition often leads to a market oligopoly .
last month , german 's largest power company e.on sold its grid to dutch group tennet for 1.1 billion euros .
the european commission has put pressure on major power companies in germany to break up production and distribution responsibilities to increase competition and lower prices. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "
unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .

greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .
prime minister george papandreou has said he has " sympathy " for the strikers , but insists there is simply " no money " for any other course of action. msh / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .
pressure from all sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these placards call on the government to cut military spending instead while the greek public calls on the government to soften its cost-cutting plans , the european union argues they do n't go far enough .
greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .
prime minister george papandreou has said he has " sympathy " for the strikers , but insists there is simply " no money " for any other course of action. msh / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 12.03.2010 traffickers use voodoo to threaten nigerian victims into prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims are forced to take oaths they believe will bring disaster upon them if broken german federal police say they have noticed a disturbing new trend in human trafficking .
some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .

" it was decided in 1980 to give h. -lsb- the priest -rsb- accommodation in a rectory so that he could receive therapy .
the archbishop took part in this decision , " the diocese of munich and freising said in a statement . the diocese confirmed that the priest in question was in munich to undergo therapy after sexually abusing young boys .
according to the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung , he was accused of forcing an 11-year old boy to perform oral sex . known paedophile allowed to work with children the priest was later returned to pastoral work .

he received a suspended prison sentence and a fine for the sexual abuse of minors . but the accused sex offender subsequently received additional church duties and continues to work for the church , though he has been barred from working with young people since 2008 , the diocese said . the former vicar-general for the diocese gerhard gruber was quick to take the blame for the decision .

environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .

" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .
but protest have done nothing to shake the resolve of the mayor of villar de canas .
" this is all politics … no one , not technicians not politicians not anybody , has demonstrated to me that this would endanger the population , much less the environment , " jose maria saiz said .
madrid says it will make its final decision in the coming months .

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "
unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .
pressure from all sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these placards call on the government to cut military spending instead while the greek public calls on the government to soften its cost-cutting plans , the european union argues they do n't go far enough .
greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .
prime minister george papandreou has said he has " sympathy " for the strikers , but insists there is simply " no money " for any other course of action. msh / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pope has yet to speak on the scandal . the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , met with the pope in the vatican to inform him of the abuse scandal plaguing the catholic church in germany .
" i want to repeat here in rome the apology that i made two weeks ago , " archbishop robert zollitsch of freiburg said at a news conference following the meeting . the pope has not commented himself on the allegation of both sexual and physical abuse that are to have taken place at catholic schools across germany in the 1970s and 1980s . the church has come under heavy criticism after an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to the systematic sexual abuse of its pupils by two roman catholic priests .
more alleged victims have since come forward , including a former member of the prestigious all-boys choir in regensburg led from 1964-1994 by the pope 's brother , georg ratzinger . slapping choirboys georg ratzinger has denied knowledge of the sexual abuse , but admitted to the newspaper passauer neue presse that he did slap choirboys . on friday , the vice president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse asked pope benedict xvi to apologize to the victims . " i think it would be appropriate if the pope expressed a public word of regret for the offenses of the catholic institutions in germany , and issued an apology , " said thierse on friday on rbb-info radio .
he added that monetary compensation was also in order , but that those affected would receive much more satisfaction if " it is really explained - and consequences are enforced , " thierse said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger thinks the church needs to do more germany 's justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has criticized the catholic church 's handling of the scandal , saying the crimes were under the jurisdiction of the justice system , not the church . during a talk show on german public television , the minister said that there had been too few prosecutions in the abuse cases . " this has to improve , " said leutheusser-schnarrenberger . so far around 120 people have come forward alleging abuse by leaders of the catholic church . smh / dpa / kna / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 12.03.2010 reporters without borders warns against internet censorship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet in china - if you read your mail , so does beijing more and more countries are censoring what their citizens can access on the internet .
on the third annual ' world day against cyber censorship ' reporters without borders has again warned of growing surveillance . the latest study by reporters without borders identified 12 " enemies of the internet " - especially in asia and the arab world .
among them are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran .
" in those countries control and surveillance of the world wide web is so strict that the internet is in fact more of an intranet , " says anja viohl , spokesperson of reporters without borders , an international organization fighting for press freedom .
china steps up its control it 's in those countries that bloggers and dissidents who use the internet are subject to repression and censorship .
china leads the way in terms of the technical effort and sophistication the authorities put into censoring online content . the country also has the largest online community with around 380 million users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google threatened to leave china after hacker attacks in january , us internet giant google had threatened to withdraw from the chinese market altogether .
the move came after hackers targeted google 's chinese service .
so far it 's not yet clear who was behind the attacks - the chinese government denies any involvement .
but regardless of whether or not beijing is responsible - there is little doubt that access to foreign websites is significantly limited across china .
sealing off the internet " the censorship by the communist government now affects almost all foreign web sites .
if you do n't actually have a chinese web address , then you 're likely to be entirely blocked so no one in china can access the site , " said adrienne woltersdorf , head of the chinese department at deutsche welle .
access to deutsche welle 's websites is strongly affected by the country 's censorship .
other international broadcasters like the bbc , voice of america and radio free asia have the same problem .

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .
heavy regulation in the energy market often translates to market values of grids being much lower than regulated values .
the grid serves about 18 million people in eastern and northern germany and covers 9,700 kilometers of high-voltage lines .
the sale increases elia 's holdings to 143,000 square kilometers serving 29 million customers .
utilities across europe have sold off lucrative but state-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable energy markets , where limited competition often leads to a market oligopoly .
last month , german 's largest power company e.on sold its grid to dutch group tennet for 1.1 billion euros .

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .
heavy regulation in the energy market often translates to market values of grids being much lower than regulated values .
the grid serves about 18 million people in eastern and northern germany and covers 9,700 kilometers of high-voltage lines .
the sale increases elia 's holdings to 143,000 square kilometers serving 29 million customers .
utilities across europe have sold off lucrative but state-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable energy markets , where limited competition often leads to a market oligopoly .
last month , german 's largest power company e.on sold its grid to dutch group tennet for 1.1 billion euros .
the european commission has put pressure on major power companies in germany to break up production and distribution responsibilities to increase competition and lower prices. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both use art to examine the impact of dictatorship . the schauspielhaus in cologne was packed as herta mueller and ai weiwei walked out onto the stage to rapturous applause . petite and elegantly-dressed in black , the winner of the 2009 nobel prize for literature radiated a sharp intelligence and a timid warmth .
beside her , the artist in his trademark casual clothes appeared bearlike but in no way did this friendly giant overshadow his interlocutor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german writer herta mueller won the nobel prize for literature in 2009 although they come from very different countries , the two artists are bound by their similar background , their courage and their sharp and constant criticism of totalitarianism . chinese cigarettes and romanian songs as young people , they were also brought together by the good relations between their two countries , which herta mueller recalled with humor .
" we always had chinese cigarettes .
i think there were five kinds , " she said with a smile . " they were the best , especially compared to the romanian ones .
the good romanian tobacco was exported .
once i walked in front of a chemist ’ s , which were usually empty , and there were glass eyes in the window .
glass eyes of all sizes and all colors .
they looked good ! " herta mueller turned her brown glass eye into a necklace , eliciting a range of responses from those around her in drab , communist romania . the romania that she knew was not the country ai weiwei dreamed of in another village thousands of miles away .
" i am happy to hear how multi-faceted china ’ s support of romania was at the time , " he told the writer with his trademark irony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei used an interpreter at the event " as you were admiring chinese glass eyes at the chemist 's , we were watching romanian films .
we thought the songs in romanian films were extremely romantic .
if we could sing them , we could capture any young girl 's heart . " however , it was not glass eyes and movies that linked china and romania most but a shared ideology . ' catastrophe for humanity ' the son of a once-revered poet who was banished into exile and forced to clean toilets during the cultural revolution , ai weiwei uses photography , video art and installations to criticize the chinese state today .
he is by no means duped by his country 's economic development . " it is certain that we live in an absolutely totalitarian state and this state does not want to give up its power structures , " he told the audience in cologne .
" this country has over a fifth of the world 's population and is trading in all directions with the world .
some say this country is the hope for the future .
i say very clearly that if this system continues to exist in this form , it will spell out catastrophe for humanity . " asked if there could be any hope at all , he assured his listeners he lived in daily hope that new technologies , especially the internet , would change the situation and bring democracy to china . for her part , herta mueller questioned whether the internet could serve as a platform for political resistance .
her fear was that the authorities in china or iran are so arrogant that they do not care if people at home or abroad know about their crimes . but ai weiwei refused to give up hope , arguing that a flicker of light in the darkness of totalitarianism was better than nothing at all . in pursuit of truth about sichuan earthquake it is this dogged optimism that drives his art and activism .
in cologne , he showed photos that he had made of the devastation wreaked by the earthquake that rocked sichuan on may 12 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei and herta mueller look at a list of the 5,200 schoolchildren who died in the sichuan earthquake of 2008 " after all the pain , all the donations , the state has not fulfilled its promise and has not investigated the sub-standard school buildings , " said ai weiwei .
" when we wanted to find out how many children had died , the state told us we were spies and we were spying for the american imperialists .
as an artist , i thought i would look for the children who had disappeared myself .
it is our responsibility . " he and dozens of volunteers - 30 of whom were later arrested by the police who confiscated their data - found out the names and dates of birth of 5,200 children who had died .
tellingly , they also discovered that they were pupils in only 20 schools out of 1,000 schools in the area - 20 schools that were probably not built according to the regulations , although this has not been proven . the list of children who died in the sichuan earthquake covers one whole wall of ai weiwei ’ s massive studio in beijing .
in cologne , the picture of this wall brought an awed silence into the room . secret police an integral part of authoritarian regimes another picture that ai weiwei showed , describing it as his best photographic work so far , was of him in a lift with two police officers that were tailing him , none too subtly .
he took the photo with his mobile phone and immediately posted it on the internet . as one of the most famous of china ’ s dissidents , ai weiwei enjoys a certain degree of protection but it takes courage to confront ones " minders " in such a way . herta mueller can very much empathize with ai weiwei 's experiences of being spied upon or accused of spying for the west .
in her novels and essays , she criticizes the securitate , romania 's secret police , and depicts the atmosphere of fear , humiliation , and distrust that prevailed in communist romania . " this immediate accusation of spying is so typical .
i think it exists in every dictatorship .
if we look at cuba or iran , they always say people are working under the influence of external powers .
i heard it all the time .
at a factory that i worked in , people would say ' so-and-so is a cia agent . '
they didn ’ t even know what cia stood for ! " she said . the greatest accusation was that a person was too individualistic , lacked collective spirit and did not display a socialist attitude .
both ai weiwei and herta mueller fell prey to this accusation but it did not stop them from taking refuge in art and literature to nurture their individuality . herta mueller saw romania ’ s brutal regime fall .
ai weiwei hopes he too will see china 's one-party system fall . author : anne thomas editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .
it 's also very important to look each person at the table in the eye while you chink glasses with them .
-lrb- according to local myth , those who drop their eyes are destined to seven years of bad sex . -rrb- in germany , kids are allowed to drink beer and wine from the age of 16 .
they can drink hard liquor once they 're 18 . unless you look like a pre-adolescent , it 's very unlikely you will be asked to show identification .
also , drinking in public is legal in germany , so do n't be surprised if you see the occasional sidewalk drinker - without a paper bag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't leave money on the table , always pay the server directly paying in most restaurants and cafes , tipping is optional .
it 's customary to round up the bill , or tip approximately five to 10 percent .
for example , if the bill is 2.80 euros , give the server 3.00 euros .
if the bill comes to 22.40 euros , give 25.00 euros .
if you were very happy with the service give more . if you have the correct change , say , " stimmt so . "
if you would like change back , say the total amount you would like to pay . be aware that most restaurants do not accept credit cards , so make sure you have enough cash before you go out to eat . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures beer , beer , beer feedback tell us about your experiences dining out in germany .

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .
you may find separate disposal areas for glass , paper and packaging .

"
when in rome do as the romans and when in germany ... you get the point .
here are some ways to avoid committing a faux pas while in germany . shaking hands shaking hands is an important part of german culture .
it is customary to shake someone 's hand when you meet them for the first time , and at every subsequent meeting as well . at business meetings and some social meetings , it 's expected that each participant shake everyone else 's hand upon arriving and again when leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shake hands with everyone in the group when you arrive and leave kissing in more casual relationships , a friend may offer their cheek instead of their hand .
it 's common for friends in germany to lightly kiss each other on both cheeks when they see each other .
at least they kiss the air next to the other person 's cheek .
though german cheek-kissing is n't quite as ingrained as in other european countries , it can still be intimidating for visitors who may be accustomed to cultures where personal space is more sacred . " sie " and " du " the german language has a formal and informal form of address .
it can take a lot of experience to learn the fine points of using " sie " and " du " but here are a few tips . the formal " sie " is always used together with the last name , for example " herr schmidt " or " frau fischer . "
store clerks , business acquaintances and strangers are always addressed with the " sie " form . when introducing yourself , it is common to give your full name or only your last name .
introducing oneself with only the first name is an indication that you want to be addressed with " du , " which may not be appropriate for the situation . " du " is used among younger people and friends , as well as for children .
it is used together with the first name .
you should not call someone by their first name unless they have offered to be addressed with the informal " du " or if they use " du " and your first name when speaking with you . it is generally the older person , or , in a business setting , the person of higher rank , who offers to switch from " sie " to " du . "
they may do this by re-introducing themselves with their first name . if you are unsure which form to use , listen for which form of address your conversation partner is using with you and use the same form with him or her . titles in addition to " herr " -lrb- mr. -rrb- and " frau " -lrb- ms. -rrb- , academic and noble titles are quite important in germany .
even if it may sound cumbersome , do n't forget to include them when speaking with someone .
they come after " herr " or " frau , " for example " herr dr. keller " or " frau prof. von henkel . "
even double titles , such as " frau prof. dr. schumann , " are n't shortened or omitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : try to be on time the word " fräulein , " is an old-fashioned word for " miss " and is no longer in use .
instead , it has been replaced with the more neutral word " frau , " which is equivalent to " ms " and gives no indication of a woman 's marital status .
do not use " fräulein , " as you are likely to offend someone . punctuality german punctuality is more than just a stereotype - it 's also common practice .
being on time is an important part of social etiquette . for business meetings and other important appointments , it is a good idea to arrive a few minutes early .
being late or rushing makes a bad impression - especially when everyone else is punctual . as for private appointments with friends and acquaintances , being " fashionably late " is impolite in germany .
arrive at the time you have arranged , as being tardy may put a damper on the evening .
the more guests there are , however , the wider the window of time is within which it is still appropriate to show up . being invited when you are invited to a private home in germany for dinner or for afternoon coffee and cake , it 's a good idea to bring a small gift for the host or hostess .
flowers are always welcome .
just be sure to bring an odd number of buds , as an even number is said to bring bad luck .
wine or candies are also appropriate to bring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers in the berlin subway are expected to separate their trash recycling trash is often separated in germany , in private homes and sometimes in public bins as well .
you may find separate disposal areas for glass , paper and packaging .
private homes may also have a separate container for organic waste , such as coffee grinds and food leftovers . many germans take recycling and trash separation seriously and ignorance of or indifference to the practice may be looked down upon . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you have any social tips to add ?

here are some dos and do n'ts to keep in mind when dining in germany . when you enter a german restaurant or cafe , do n't wait to be seated .
in most places you 're expected to choose your own seat .
in less expensive eateries , it 's appropriate to sit at a free seat at an occupied table , if there 's nothing else available .
ask the person already at the table , " ist hier frei ? "
-lrb- roughly : is this chair available ? -rrb- sitting at someone else 's table does n't necessarily mean you have to talk to them .
however , if your neighbor does seem open to conversation , it may just be a good opportunity to practice your german .
even if you do n't exchange any other words , it 's polite to wish your neighbor " guten appetit " -lrb- enjoy your meal -rrb- and to say " tschüß " or " auf wiedersehen " -lrb- goodbye -rrb- when you leave . service water is not necessarily complimentary in restaurants .
if you order wasser , you will be served mineral water with bubbles and no ice .
ask for stilles wasser if you prefer water without carbonation . you can ask for a glass of leitungswasser -lrb- tap water -rrb- , but you might get a frown from wait staff who think you 're being cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are allowed to drink beer at 16 many beverages , including beer , are served according to volume .
a restaurant may offer 0.2 -lrb- " null-zwei " -rrb- , 0.3 -lrb- " null-drei " -rrb- or 0.5 -lrb- " null-fünf " -rrb- liter portions . bread or any other complimentary appetizers are normally only served in finer restaurants .
if you would like a basket of bread , you 'll have to order it - and pay for it . do n't expect the server to regularly ask how things are ; it is considered more polite not to disturb guests while they are eating . the waiter or waitress will probably bring the food and then disappear until you give a hand signal indicating you want to pay .
the question , " hat es ihnen geschmeckt ? "
-lrb- did you enjoy it ? -rrb- wo n't come until after you 've finished the meal .
granted , nothing more can be done about it , but the question is asked nevertheless .
leaving food on your plate may be interpreted as an indication that you did n't enjoy it . etiquette generally speaking , the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left -lrb- or vice versa for left-handers -rrb- .
however , the utensils do not change hands during the course of the meal .
when you are done with your meal , place your fork and knife together on your plate , facing in from the right side - at about 4 o 'clock .
for the attentive server , this is a signal that he or she may clear your plate . place your fork and knife separately across the plate in opposite directions , with the fork pointed down , if you are still enjoying your meal .
this silent silverware language is common practice , even in private homes . if you 're going to partake of germany 's most famous beverage , then you also have to know how to toast correctly .
the most common toasts are " prost ! "
-lrb- cheers ! -rrb- or " zum wohl ! "
-lrb- to your health ! -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 12.03.2010 egyptians hoping elbaradei can provide change they can believe in 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei has mobilised a coalition of egypt 's opposition former un nuclear chief mohammed elbaradei has made no official announcement about running for egypt 's presidency in 2011 but a surge of support built on the hope for change is sweeping him closer to the campaign trail . such is the desire for change among liberal thinkers in egypt that any sliver of hope of overturning almost three decades of rule by president hosni mubarak is enthusiastically championed .
it does n't seem to matter that the next presidential election is over a year away or that potential reformist leaders are wildly celebrated despite not being legally allowed to run for office .
it appears that a slim chance is better than none at all .
the reception afforded mohammed elbaradei on his homecoming to cairo last week seemed to sum up the mood of many who have grown up under mubarak 's increasingly oppressive and divisive leadership .
rapturous crowds of thousands welcomed elbaradei , many inspired by the calls from egypt 's normally moribund opposition figures for him to run against mubarak in 2011 , if the 81-year-old incumbent decides to stand again .
the reaction to elbaradei 's return also smacked of desperation .
the nobel peace prize laureate is officially banned under egypt 's constitution from running for president .
amendments to the constitution passed in 2005 and 2007 prohibit him from doing so , a fact well-known among the celebrating masses .
and yet , he was still welcomed as a national hero and saviour .
while neither counting himself in nor ruling himself out , elbaradei has certainly stirred up debate over the future of egypt , a country that has a history of strongly suppressing dissent and criticism of the president and his methods .
support from cross-section of egyptian society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public support has led to elbaradei being championed echoing another leader who was swept to power on a public longing for change , elbaradei has already formed a ' coalition for change , ' a group of like-minded opposition leaders aimed at reforming egypt 's constitution .
claiming that 99 percent of egyptians want their country to head in a new direction , elbaradei has also begun rallying " the poor and the rich , the young and the old … women wearing the niqab , the hijab , or not veiled at all ; intellectuals ; peasants ; people of all ages and classes . "
but much like us president barack obama , elbaradei has made it clear that he does not want to be seen as a saviour .
however , just as huge expectations pushed obama to the white house , it may already be too late .
" elbaradei has become the symbol of the hope for change for millions of egyptians , " novelist alaa al-aswani told reporters on tuesday .
government restrictions make candidacy near impossible despite the growing movement behind elbaradei , analysts say election rules make it almost impossible for any candidate to stage a realistic challenge against the one nominated by mubarak 's ruling national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mubarak 's party holds the power over independents " the chances of elbaradei running are very slim , " dr. amr hamzawy , research director at the carnegie middle east centre in beirut , told deutsche welle .
" the constitutional restrictions introduced in the amendments of 2005 and 2007 say that independent candidates must have 250 signatures from parliamentary and local council members . " " the problem is that the ruling national democratic party holds 95 percent of the parliament and around 90 percent of council seats .
this means no independent candidate will get enough signatures .
the official , legal parties - even if they only have one seat - can field a candidate but elbaradei has said that he will not be joining a party . " elbaradei 's refusal to join a party has been part of his stance to emphasize the restrictive nature of political process and to call for the reform of the egyptian constitution to allow more competition and representation , something the ruling government has rejected . " elbaradei is understandably reluctant to run as the candidate of any of the existing opposition parties , which are all weak and many of them have been co-opted by the government and discredited with the public , " georgetown university professor michelle dunne , an expert on arab politics , told deutsche welle . " he has formed a ' front ' with other opposition figures to call for constitutional and legal changes to liberalize rules to run for the presidency .
he would need to gather a lot of popular support in egypt and international support in order to press mubarak to allow such changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2010 german it-start-ups hope for better times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes more creativity to get an internet business going these days the finance crisis has hit young it start-ups in germany hard .
the times when investors pumped millions into young companies are over , and the aspirations of german entrepreneurs have become much more modest . so you want to work hard for two years and make millions ?
in recent years , many young it companies have managed to turn this dream into reality : think of facebook , ebay or amazon , whose founders made a fortune .
but times have changed and the global economic crisis has hit the international start-up scene .
the equation is simple : no investors equals no huge start-ups .
for most young entrepreneurs in the german it sector the future is not about becoming a millionaire , it 's about surviving .
according to a survey by financial magazine wirtschaftswoche , every fifth german start-up was close to bankruptcy in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : start-up consultant kai thierhoff from cologne says it 's a tough world out there " things have become a little harder , " kai thierhoff , an it consultant from cologne , told deutsche welle .
" people have stopped investing in young companies . "
investors want to see results before paying ingrid wandel is one of the entrepreneurs who had to face this new reality firsthand .
she developed a new way to find out how people think about fragrances - ideal for beauty product companies .
until now , wandel says , market research on fragrances was difficult and costly .
her small business fragloom tries to solve this problem by showing respondents online pictures meant to express how they might feel about a certain fragrance .
while this may seem like a great idea , investors did not think so in 2009 .
wandel lost existing client contacts and banks refused to give her a loan .
" it was really hard , i had put all my effort into my ideas , " she said .
wandel did what most desperate business people do in these difficult times : she launched her company with what little money she had .
now she believes she will make it , having signed contracts for new projects in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wandel developed a new web-based market research strategy " it 's a misperception that someone gives you the money to create what you want to create .
that 's not the case , " said consultant kai thierhoff , before explaining that the trick is to get the company running first and look for investors later .
" you need to show what you have to get an investor , " said thierhoff .
" people nowadays invest later and they look a lot more into the business model than they used to . "
a lot of german copycats it also seems that german start-ups need to be more creative to create a hit than in years past .
the german web community studivz is an example of halcyon days long passed .
the enthusiasm surrounding its launch and initial success gave way to accusations that it was just a copy of its american counterpart facebook , but not before it was sold for an alleged 100 million euros -lrb- $ 136 million -rrb- to the publisher holtzbrinck .
" there were a lot of copycats out there , " said thierhoff .
while the alleged copy appears to have worked for the founders of studivz , analysts say that holtzbrinck 's massive investment is unlikely to pay off .
" it 's not about web traffic anymore , it 's about sales , " thierhoff said , adding that the days when web communities seemed to be launched daily are long gone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-guenther herrmann has rather modest plans twenty-five-year-old hans-guenther herrmann is one young entrepreneurs who has adapted to the new business environment .
he is not financed by an investor , but through a german government grant .
and he wants to " start things small , " rather than landing that infamous million-euro sale as soon as possible .
herrmann has created a web platform where university students can exchange notes taken at lectures - helpful for those students who missed a class due to illness or simply do n't want to go .

the times when investors pumped millions into young companies are over , and the aspirations of german entrepreneurs have become much more modest . so you want to work hard for two years and make millions ?
in recent years , many young it companies have managed to turn this dream into reality : think of facebook , ebay or amazon , whose founders made a fortune .
but times have changed and the global economic crisis has hit the international start-up scene .
the equation is simple : no investors equals no huge start-ups .
for most young entrepreneurs in the german it sector the future is not about becoming a millionaire , it 's about surviving .
according to a survey by financial magazine wirtschaftswoche , every fifth german start-up was close to bankruptcy in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : start-up consultant kai thierhoff from cologne says it 's a tough world out there " things have become a little harder , " kai thierhoff , an it consultant from cologne , told deutsche welle .
" people have stopped investing in young companies . "
investors want to see results before paying ingrid wandel is one of the entrepreneurs who had to face this new reality firsthand .
she developed a new way to find out how people think about fragrances - ideal for beauty product companies .
until now , wandel says , market research on fragrances was difficult and costly .
her small business fragloom tries to solve this problem by showing respondents online pictures meant to express how they might feel about a certain fragrance .
while this may seem like a great idea , investors did not think so in 2009 .
wandel lost existing client contacts and banks refused to give her a loan .
" it was really hard , i had put all my effort into my ideas , " she said .
wandel did what most desperate business people do in these difficult times : she launched her company with what little money she had .
now she believes she will make it , having signed contracts for new projects in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wandel developed a new web-based market research strategy " it 's a misperception that someone gives you the money to create what you want to create .
that 's not the case , " said consultant kai thierhoff , before explaining that the trick is to get the company running first and look for investors later .
" you need to show what you have to get an investor , " said thierhoff .
" people nowadays invest later and they look a lot more into the business model than they used to . "
a lot of german copycats it also seems that german start-ups need to be more creative to create a hit than in years past .
the german web community studivz is an example of halcyon days long passed .
the enthusiasm surrounding its launch and initial success gave way to accusations that it was just a copy of its american counterpart facebook , but not before it was sold for an alleged 100 million euros -lrb- $ 136 million -rrb- to the publisher holtzbrinck .
" there were a lot of copycats out there , " said thierhoff .
while the alleged copy appears to have worked for the founders of studivz , analysts say that holtzbrinck 's massive investment is unlikely to pay off .
" it 's not about web traffic anymore , it 's about sales , " thierhoff said , adding that the days when web communities seemed to be launched daily are long gone .

he is not financed by an investor , but through a german government grant .
and he wants to " start things small , " rather than landing that infamous million-euro sale as soon as possible .
herrmann has created a web platform where university students can exchange notes taken at lectures - helpful for those students who missed a class due to illness or simply do n't want to go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 12.03.2010 six of the best : germany 's f1 hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumi and co are in bahrain for the first race of 2010 germany is threatening to monopolize the formula one grid nowadays , with no fewer than six drivers - that 's one quarter of the entire field - competing at bahrain this weekend .
dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "
unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .

greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "
unions representing almost half of greece 's five-million-strong workforce had called for thursday 's general strike , which grounded flights , stopped public transport and closed schools and museums .
pressure from all sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these placards call on the government to cut military spending instead while the greek public calls on the government to soften its cost-cutting plans , the european union argues they do n't go far enough .
greece 's budget deficit in 2009 stood at 12.7 per cent of the country 's gross domestic product , more than four times the prescribed euro-zone limit of three per cent of gdp .
the government 's latest austerity measures - which include a rise in consumer tax , cuts in civil servant wages , and a pension freeze - are meant to save the country 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
the european commission welcomed greece 's latest budgetary plans , but also reserved the right to intervene if it feels that the country is not making sufficient progress improving the financial situation .
as greece struggles to rein in a national debt that is approaching 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.8 billion -rrb- , no one disputes that the country needs to tighten its belt , however polls show that a large majority of greeks believe that the rich should be made to pay for the crisis .
prime minister george papandreou has said he has " sympathy " for the strikers , but insists there is simply " no money " for any other course of action. msh / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 12.03.2010 hanover teenager named germany 's hope for eurovision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lena meyer-landrut ca n't believe she 'll be representing germany in olso it 's official : hanover schoolgirl lena meyer-landrut will represent germany in the eurovision song contest this year , after winning national television casting show " our star for oslo . " come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 12.03.2010 six of the best : germany 's f1 hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumi and co are in bahrain for the first race of 2010 germany is threatening to monopolize the formula one grid nowadays , with no fewer than six drivers - that 's one quarter of the entire field - competing at bahrain this weekend .
dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

" they have very little representation in parliament , their work and ability to reach out effectively to constituencies has been heavily restricted since the state of emergency came into power in 1981 and they have failed to convince egyptians that they have a solid platform and policies . " " the opposition is splintered along an ideological divide , between islamists and secularists and its potential power has been stripped by constant in-fighting .
those who are in a position of relative power are there because they have struck a deal with the government ; they agree to limit their reach in return for a guaranteed percentage of seats . " mubarak remains cagey as mouthpieces take aim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mubarak lets his subordinates and cronies do the talking president mubarak has yet to publicly respond to elbaradei 's government-baiting and claims of a lack of democracy in egypt .
earlier this month while in germany for an operation to remove his gall bladder , mubarak said that elbaradei was welcome to run for president as long as he respected the constitution . but the president bristled when asked in the same news conference whether elbaradei was a national hero .
" we do not need a national hero , here or there , " the president said . while mubarak himself refuses to openly criticise the former diplomat and iaea chief , his government and media mouthpieces have been taking aim .
osama saraya , editor of the government 's flagship daily newspaper al-ahram , has accused elbaradei of being " ill-informed " and " an american stooge " while minister of state for legal and parliamentary affairs moufid shehab said elbaradei was out of touch and knew nothing about the challenges facing today 's egypt . not all opposition groups have joined behind elbaradei either .
the muslim brotherhood , egypt 's largest opposition group , has announced it would not support him .
" those who support elbaradei are an elitist bloc with no roots in the egyptian street , " senior brotherhood leader mohammed habib wrote in the independent newspaper al-masry al-youm . observers talk up potential dynastic succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of military background may count against gamal it is still not clear whether mubarak will stand again in 2011 with some observers believing he will hand power to his son gamal in the hope of creating a dynasty , a move which may add weight to elbaradei 's claims that egypt has been following the pattern of pharaoic regimes for the past 7,000 years . " of course the amendments made to the constitution and the limitations placed on independent candidates for the presidency have been put in place by mubarak to protect his rule and keep the power within his regime , " hamzawy said . " now his son gamal is being groomed , it looks as though this will continue .
i personally believe that hosni mubarak , if his health holds , will run for a sixth term . " if gamal , who heads the policy secretariat of the ruling national democratic party , is not named as mubarak 's successor , egypt 's intelligence chief omar suleiman , a close aide to the president , is the next most likely candidate . " mubarak knows that there is a certain amount of opposition to his plans for a dynastic solution to the succession question and knows that it would be difficult for him to anoint gamal should he decide not to run himself , " almut moeller , a middle east expert at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle . egypt faces an uncertain future moeller believes that the political instruments mubarak has installed during nearly 30 years of rule can almost guarantee that his party and regime will continue to run egypt after 2011 .
what is less clear is the future the country will face after the next presidential election . " if egypt gets more of the same in terms of a ruling government , it 's very hard to say how egyptians will react , " moeller said .
" there has been a growing opposition movement and unease within egyptian society for some time now .
if there is an eruption , a revolt , then it is very hard to say how the regime would respond to that . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it does n't seem to matter that the next presidential election is over a year away or that potential reformist leaders are wildly celebrated despite not being legally allowed to run for office .
it appears that a slim chance is better than none at all .
the reception afforded mohammed elbaradei on his homecoming to cairo last week seemed to sum up the mood of many who have grown up under mubarak 's increasingly oppressive and divisive leadership .
rapturous crowds of thousands welcomed elbaradei , many inspired by the calls from egypt 's normally moribund opposition figures for him to run against mubarak in 2011 , if the 81-year-old incumbent decides to stand again .
the reaction to elbaradei 's return also smacked of desperation .
the nobel peace prize laureate is officially banned under egypt 's constitution from running for president .
amendments to the constitution passed in 2005 and 2007 prohibit him from doing so , a fact well-known among the celebrating masses .
and yet , he was still welcomed as a national hero and saviour .
while neither counting himself in nor ruling himself out , elbaradei has certainly stirred up debate over the future of egypt , a country that has a history of strongly suppressing dissent and criticism of the president and his methods .
support from cross-section of egyptian society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public support has led to elbaradei being championed echoing another leader who was swept to power on a public longing for change , elbaradei has already formed a ' coalition for change , ' a group of like-minded opposition leaders aimed at reforming egypt 's constitution .
claiming that 99 percent of egyptians want their country to head in a new direction , elbaradei has also begun rallying " the poor and the rich , the young and the old … women wearing the niqab , the hijab , or not veiled at all ; intellectuals ; peasants ; people of all ages and classes . "
but much like us president barack obama , elbaradei has made it clear that he does not want to be seen as a saviour .
however , just as huge expectations pushed obama to the white house , it may already be too late .
" elbaradei has become the symbol of the hope for change for millions of egyptians , " novelist alaa al-aswani told reporters on tuesday .
government restrictions make candidacy near impossible despite the growing movement behind elbaradei , analysts say election rules make it almost impossible for any candidate to stage a realistic challenge against the one nominated by mubarak 's ruling national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mubarak 's party holds the power over independents " the chances of elbaradei running are very slim , " dr. amr hamzawy , research director at the carnegie middle east centre in beirut , told deutsche welle .
" the constitutional restrictions introduced in the amendments of 2005 and 2007 say that independent candidates must have 250 signatures from parliamentary and local council members . " " the problem is that the ruling national democratic party holds 95 percent of the parliament and around 90 percent of council seats .
this means no independent candidate will get enough signatures .
the official , legal parties - even if they only have one seat - can field a candidate but elbaradei has said that he will not be joining a party . " elbaradei 's refusal to join a party has been part of his stance to emphasize the restrictive nature of political process and to call for the reform of the egyptian constitution to allow more competition and representation , something the ruling government has rejected . " elbaradei is understandably reluctant to run as the candidate of any of the existing opposition parties , which are all weak and many of them have been co-opted by the government and discredited with the public , " georgetown university professor michelle dunne , an expert on arab politics , told deutsche welle . " he has formed a ' front ' with other opposition figures to call for constitutional and legal changes to liberalize rules to run for the presidency .

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.03.2010 spanish villages vie for nuclear waste dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regions with reactors , both former and current , are ideal for the final site .
when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "

at least a million greeks took part in a general strike . a general strike in greece , called to protest against a series of unpopular government austerity measures , descended into violence on thursday .
in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.03.2010 spanish villages vie for nuclear waste dump großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regions with reactors , both former and current , are ideal for the final site .
when madrid announced plans to build a centralized nuclear waste repository last year , more than 100 towns surged forward to offer their land .
there are now just a few in the running .
but what 's in it for the winner ? the spanish government has a long list of demands for the 25-hectare-site .
it needs to be protected , yet remote , not threatened by earthquakes or floods , not in a nature reserve or near an airport , but close to a railway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most protests have taken place in neighbouring communities the nine communities still being considered are either located close to one of the country 's eight operational nuclear power stations , or near one of those which has already been shut down .
one advantage of these areas is that they have already undergone geological and environmental assessments .
another is the willingness of the local mayors .
and the little town of villar de canas , about an hour 's drive south of madrid , is a case in point .
officially it has 460 inhabitants , but many of them only go there during the holidays or to escape city-life at the weekends .
what was once a hive of human activity is now more akin to a ghost town .
with their shuttered windows , the sleepy streets paint a tired picture of village life , a picture that mayor jose maria saiz bitterly laments .
" closed , closed , closed , " he told deutsche welle as he pointed to the buildings around the deserted main square .
six in ten houses in the village are closed off .
" there 's no work here so people have gone to the big cities , to madrid or to valencia . "
a shadow of things past back in the sixties and seventies , there were 2000 people living in the village , the little school was bursting at the seams with children .
these days there are just 15 pupils on the register and that figure could drop even further unless something is done to put some of the color back into villar de canas .
" we have put in a bid for the repository because we saw it as a way of injecting life into our town again , " jose maria saiz said .
" in addition to that , when you look into the matter and you find out that the repository does n't put the population or the environment at risk , of course , you accept it to save your town . "
and it is certainly an attractive package .
the winning bid for the 700 million euro project is expected to generate work for some 500 people over a five-year construction period .
and once the site is up and running , it will create 140 permanent jobs and offer many opportunities for locals to provide support services .
pros and cons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of germany 's nuclear waste has been stored in a flawed location according to jose maria saiz , nearly all villar de canas residents are in favor of the project .
in the town 's only open cafe that day , the locals all voice their support , but murmurs of apprehension can be found .
" i would like them to build it here , because it is a small town and it is dying , but there is a lack of information , " said the woman at the bakery counter of the local supermarket , who identified herself as canatanaz .
" of course they are not going to put a bomb in our backyard , but there are always risks and doubts . "
but not for alvaro rodriguez beceiro , the chief engineer at enresa in madrid , the state-owned company that is scheduled to build the nuclear storage facility once the location has been decided upon .
he thinks locals have nothing to fear .
" i know for sure that we are providing a very safe installation , " he said , comparing the facilities to others he described as ' standard ' across europe .
" the main general objective of the design of the installation will be to protect the people and the environment . "
environmental fears but environmental organizations like greenpeace are not convinced .
carlos bravo , head of the energy department at greenpeace spain , would prefer to see spain 's nuclear waste retained at the nuclear power plants where it is produced .
" centralized storage is a dangerous installation that has a lot of risks of accidents , he said .
greenpeace is concerned that a centralized nuclear waste dump would expose the community to a greater risk of accidents , because of the increased amount of transportation of nuclear materials involved , and because the final site would prove a tempting target for terrorists .
" you can imagine in the case of a plane crash for instance , it could be disastrous , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish industry minister miguel sebastian announced the plant in all the spanish regions where towns have volunteered to house the repository , neighboring towns and regional governments have criticized the decision and there have been popular demonstrations against the plans .
but protest have done nothing to shake the resolve of the mayor of villar de canas .
" this is all politics … no one , not technicians not politicians not anybody , has demonstrated to me that this would endanger the population , much less the environment , " jose maria saiz said .
madrid says it will make its final decision in the coming months .
for better or for worse , the project will no doubt change the prospects of one sleepy spanish town . author : mikkel larsen / tkw editor : nathan witkop nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2010 german it-start-ups hope for better times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes more creativity to get an internet business going these days the finance crisis has hit young it start-ups in germany hard .
the times when investors pumped millions into young companies are over , and the aspirations of german entrepreneurs have become much more modest . so you want to work hard for two years and make millions ?
in recent years , many young it companies have managed to turn this dream into reality : think of facebook , ebay or amazon , whose founders made a fortune .
but times have changed and the global economic crisis has hit the international start-up scene .
the equation is simple : no investors equals no huge start-ups .
for most young entrepreneurs in the german it sector the future is not about becoming a millionaire , it 's about surviving .
according to a survey by financial magazine wirtschaftswoche , every fifth german start-up was close to bankruptcy in 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : start-up consultant kai thierhoff from cologne says it 's a tough world out there " things have become a little harder , " kai thierhoff , an it consultant from cologne , told deutsche welle .
" people have stopped investing in young companies . "
investors want to see results before paying ingrid wandel is one of the entrepreneurs who had to face this new reality firsthand .
she developed a new way to find out how people think about fragrances - ideal for beauty product companies .
until now , wandel says , market research on fragrances was difficult and costly .
her small business fragloom tries to solve this problem by showing respondents online pictures meant to express how they might feel about a certain fragrance .
while this may seem like a great idea , investors did not think so in 2009 .
wandel lost existing client contacts and banks refused to give her a loan .
" it was really hard , i had put all my effort into my ideas , " she said .
wandel did what most desperate business people do in these difficult times : she launched her company with what little money she had .
now she believes she will make it , having signed contracts for new projects in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wandel developed a new web-based market research strategy " it 's a misperception that someone gives you the money to create what you want to create .
that 's not the case , " said consultant kai thierhoff , before explaining that the trick is to get the company running first and look for investors later .
" you need to show what you have to get an investor , " said thierhoff .
" people nowadays invest later and they look a lot more into the business model than they used to . "
a lot of german copycats it also seems that german start-ups need to be more creative to create a hit than in years past .
the german web community studivz is an example of halcyon days long passed .
the enthusiasm surrounding its launch and initial success gave way to accusations that it was just a copy of its american counterpart facebook , but not before it was sold for an alleged 100 million euros -lrb- $ 136 million -rrb- to the publisher holtzbrinck .
" there were a lot of copycats out there , " said thierhoff .
while the alleged copy appears to have worked for the founders of studivz , analysts say that holtzbrinck 's massive investment is unlikely to pay off .
" it 's not about web traffic anymore , it 's about sales , " thierhoff said , adding that the days when web communities seemed to be launched daily are long gone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-guenther herrmann has rather modest plans twenty-five-year-old hans-guenther herrmann is one young entrepreneurs who has adapted to the new business environment .
he is not financed by an investor , but through a german government grant .
and he wants to " start things small , " rather than landing that infamous million-euro sale as soon as possible .
herrmann has created a web platform where university students can exchange notes taken at lectures - helpful for those students who missed a class due to illness or simply do n't want to go .
it 's an online community , but every set of notes has a small price that provides hermann 's company unidog with a couple of cents .
both wandel and herrmann are hoping that their start-ups will become a hit in 2010 , and both have chosen projects that are not affected by the economic crisis .
herrmann targets students who might still have a spare euro or two for university lecture notes , while wandel tries to convince her customers that her new method of fragrance research can save them a lot of money .
it 's not clear whether either of them will succeed .
but for the chance to make it big , they 're willing to risk failure .

both use art to examine the impact of dictatorship . the schauspielhaus in cologne was packed as herta mueller and ai weiwei walked out onto the stage to rapturous applause . petite and elegantly-dressed in black , the winner of the 2009 nobel prize for literature radiated a sharp intelligence and a timid warmth .
beside her , the artist in his trademark casual clothes appeared bearlike but in no way did this friendly giant overshadow his interlocutor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german writer herta mueller won the nobel prize for literature in 2009 although they come from very different countries , the two artists are bound by their similar background , their courage and their sharp and constant criticism of totalitarianism . chinese cigarettes and romanian songs as young people , they were also brought together by the good relations between their two countries , which herta mueller recalled with humor .
" we always had chinese cigarettes .
i think there were five kinds , " she said with a smile . " they were the best , especially compared to the romanian ones .
the good romanian tobacco was exported .
once i walked in front of a chemist ’ s , which were usually empty , and there were glass eyes in the window .
glass eyes of all sizes and all colors .
they looked good ! " herta mueller turned her brown glass eye into a necklace , eliciting a range of responses from those around her in drab , communist romania . the romania that she knew was not the country ai weiwei dreamed of in another village thousands of miles away .
" i am happy to hear how multi-faceted china ’ s support of romania was at the time , " he told the writer with his trademark irony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei used an interpreter at the event " as you were admiring chinese glass eyes at the chemist 's , we were watching romanian films .
we thought the songs in romanian films were extremely romantic .
if we could sing them , we could capture any young girl 's heart . " however , it was not glass eyes and movies that linked china and romania most but a shared ideology . ' catastrophe for humanity ' the son of a once-revered poet who was banished into exile and forced to clean toilets during the cultural revolution , ai weiwei uses photography , video art and installations to criticize the chinese state today .
he is by no means duped by his country 's economic development . " it is certain that we live in an absolutely totalitarian state and this state does not want to give up its power structures , " he told the audience in cologne .
" this country has over a fifth of the world 's population and is trading in all directions with the world .
some say this country is the hope for the future .
i say very clearly that if this system continues to exist in this form , it will spell out catastrophe for humanity . " asked if there could be any hope at all , he assured his listeners he lived in daily hope that new technologies , especially the internet , would change the situation and bring democracy to china . for her part , herta mueller questioned whether the internet could serve as a platform for political resistance .
her fear was that the authorities in china or iran are so arrogant that they do not care if people at home or abroad know about their crimes . but ai weiwei refused to give up hope , arguing that a flicker of light in the darkness of totalitarianism was better than nothing at all . in pursuit of truth about sichuan earthquake it is this dogged optimism that drives his art and activism .
in cologne , he showed photos that he had made of the devastation wreaked by the earthquake that rocked sichuan on may 12 , 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ai weiwei and herta mueller look at a list of the 5,200 schoolchildren who died in the sichuan earthquake of 2008 " after all the pain , all the donations , the state has not fulfilled its promise and has not investigated the sub-standard school buildings , " said ai weiwei .
" when we wanted to find out how many children had died , the state told us we were spies and we were spying for the american imperialists .
as an artist , i thought i would look for the children who had disappeared myself .
it is our responsibility . " he and dozens of volunteers - 30 of whom were later arrested by the police who confiscated their data - found out the names and dates of birth of 5,200 children who had died .
tellingly , they also discovered that they were pupils in only 20 schools out of 1,000 schools in the area - 20 schools that were probably not built according to the regulations , although this has not been proven . the list of children who died in the sichuan earthquake covers one whole wall of ai weiwei ’ s massive studio in beijing .
in cologne , the picture of this wall brought an awed silence into the room . secret police an integral part of authoritarian regimes another picture that ai weiwei showed , describing it as his best photographic work so far , was of him in a lift with two police officers that were tailing him , none too subtly .
he took the photo with his mobile phone and immediately posted it on the internet . as one of the most famous of china ’ s dissidents , ai weiwei enjoys a certain degree of protection but it takes courage to confront ones " minders " in such a way . herta mueller can very much empathize with ai weiwei 's experiences of being spied upon or accused of spying for the west .
in her novels and essays , she criticizes the securitate , romania 's secret police , and depicts the atmosphere of fear , humiliation , and distrust that prevailed in communist romania . " this immediate accusation of spying is so typical .
i think it exists in every dictatorship .
if we look at cuba or iran , they always say people are working under the influence of external powers .
i heard it all the time .
at a factory that i worked in , people would say ' so-and-so is a cia agent . '
they didn ’ t even know what cia stood for ! " she said . the greatest accusation was that a person was too individualistic , lacked collective spirit and did not display a socialist attitude .
both ai weiwei and herta mueller fell prey to this accusation but it did not stop them from taking refuge in art and literature to nurture their individuality . herta mueller saw romania ’ s brutal regime fall .

westerwelle 's diplomatic trips großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle dismissed the claims as a ' personal attack ' as guido westerwelle wraps up his trip through south america , the foreign minister is accused of pursuing personal interests in choosing his accompanying business delegation .
but how are these delegations really chosen ? foreign minister guido westerwelle has faced extensive allegations of combining his official diplomatic trips with personal business interests .
on friday , members of several opposition parties vehemently criticized the minister for bringing a business partner of his brother on a diplomatic trip to asia in january , saying he had made the choice based more on his own interests than those of germany .
" westerwelle is damaging the federal republic , he is damaging the image of the foreign ministry , " said renate kuenast , a senior figure in the green party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is under fire for bringing his partner -lrb- left -rrb- in connection with his latest whirlwind journey to south america , which he wrapped up friday in brazil , westerwelle was criticized for bringing along his life partner , michael mronz , who was allegedly pursuing business opportunities in the sporting events industry .
german chancellor angela merkel came out in defense of westerwelle and his selection of business delegations that have accompanied him on past diplomatic journeys , saying she was " confident that the foreign minister 's selections were in full compliance with the rules , " according to a statement from berlin on friday .
how the process works but the controversy surrounding westerwelle 's business delegations begs the question : how does the german foreign ministry choose which business representatives travel on official diplomatic journeys ?
according to spokesman stefan bredohl , when the foreign ministry announces the planning of a trip , the german embassy in the host country puts together a list of economic areas of interest in that country and sends it to berlin .
particular emphasis , says bredohl , is placed on regions where " significant projects - such as renewable energy , as was the case in china - are already in place where german companies can then further economic development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german media has made a big deal of who travels with the foreign minister the foreign ministry then consults the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- to create a list of some 60 companies that could accompany the foreign minister .
westerwelle has the final say which companies can send a representative to travel with him ; in most cases , his business delegation consists of between 10 and 20 representatives .
customary practice according to professor thomas fischer , a political scientist at the brussels office of the bertelsman foundation , the delegations that accompany german diplomatic trips are " very similar " to those of other countries .
fischer added that westerwelle 's " handpicking " of business representatives was " nothing new , " and that " if foreign ministers could n't choose the people they brought with them on their diplomatic journeys , this would be a disservice to both the german government and economy . "
" merkel , schroeder , steinmeier , they all formed their entourages themselves , " fischer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder also brought whomever he wanted , says fischer " in principle , there is nothing wrong with lobbyism , or with governments being accompanied by strategically chosen representatives .
the question is , and i think this is relevant in the westerwelle issue , is whether the representatives are actually strategically chosen , " he added .
westerwelle fights back the allegations facing westerwelle are indeed not based on whether he was pursuing economic interests on his trips , which has been the case in the past with his pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , but rather that he was pursuing merely personal interests .
westerwelle strongly denied all claims against him on friday and accused those who made the allegations of attempting to defame him and his family .
he added that all delegations he has brought with him since becoming foreign minister late last year " fully deserved to represent germany and its economic interests abroad . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 12.03.2010 muslim groups consider boycott of german-islam conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference aims to advance muslim integration the hopes of the german-islam conference were high when it was founded four years ago .
but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "

the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "

but the interior ministry 's exclusion of one german muslim group has put the attendance of three of the group 's partners in doubt . germany 's four largest muslim associations debated a potential boycott of the german-islam conference in cologne on friday after the interior ministry excluded one of the groups from attendance .
the four groups were unable to reach a collective decision after nearly eight hours of discussion .
talks could though resume next friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has gained high-profile media coverage in germany " it was a very intense discussion - which proves the importance of this matter , " spokesman bekir alboga told reporters after the meeting .
" all options are still on the table . "
the four groups were the council of islam ; the central council of muslims ; ditib , which constructs mosques for the turkish religious affairs ministry ; and the union of islamic cultural centers .
the groups represent only five of the 30 members of the german-islam conference , with the remaining seats reserved for individual muslims of various backgrounds and federal , state and local community representatives .
unwelcome guests the meeting of the four groups came after german interior minister thomas de maiziere excluded the council of islam from the conference .
the group is dominated by the fundamentalist turkish-based milli gorus movement , which has been the subject of a federal criminal investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference has also discussed poor performance of muslim students the interior ministry claimed the investigation , which involves money laundering and fraudulent misuse of donations , would overshadow the goals of the conference .
de maiziere told german daily sueddeutsche zeitung the removal of the council of islam had " nothing to do with the other organizations , " and that the rest were still " very welcome . "
ehrhart koerting , head of berlin 's interior ministry and a member of the opposition social democrats , called de maiziere 's decision " unreasonable . "
" if we want to advance the integration of islam in germany , then we have to speak with all the representatives of the muslim community who are ready for discussion and have rejected violence , " koerting told german news agency dpa on friday .
koerting added that while he understood a desire to not sit down with people under criminal investigation , the rest of the 30,000 members of the council of islam should not be shut out while the investigation is still underway .
lofty goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many muslims want racism and islamophobia included in the agenda the german government founded the german-islam conference in 2006 to provide an official platform to discuss muslim integration in the country .
specific topics have included poverty , unemployment and the poor academic performance of muslim children .
but critics , muslim and non-muslim alike , have questioned the conference 's effectiveness .
the months-long proceedings of the conference have suffered from sharp disagreements , including among muslim participants , and results have been vague .
only 20 percent of germany 's four million muslims are actually represented by the four groups that participate , while the vast majority remains unaffiliated with any group .
some muslim participants have also complained of the conference 's agenda , which has not focused on racism and islamophobia .
de maiziere told sueddeutsche zeitung that these subjects " can certainly find a place . "

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .
heavy regulation in the energy market often translates to market values of grids being much lower than regulated values .
the grid serves about 18 million people in eastern and northern germany and covers 9,700 kilometers of high-voltage lines .
the sale increases elia 's holdings to 143,000 square kilometers serving 29 million customers .
utilities across europe have sold off lucrative but state-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable energy markets , where limited competition often leads to a market oligopoly .
last month , german 's largest power company e.on sold its grid to dutch group tennet for 1.1 billion euros .

the move appears to be part of a continuing trend of energy groups shedding highly-regulated power grids in favor of more profitable markets . state-owned swedish energy group vattenfall announced on friday that it would sell its high-voltage power grid to belgian firm elia and australia 's industry funds management .
the sale was priced at 810 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- , with 60 percent going to elia , a power network management company , and the rest going to infrastructure specialist ifm .
" the sale reinforces our position in the perspective of participating in the constitution of a true european energy market , " elia chief daniel dobbeni said .
vattenfall 's head of european activities , tuomo hatakka , said at a news conference that the grid was strategic because " it links vast offshore wind farms in the baltic and north seas with consumer industries in northern germany . "
he added that vattenfall was " not obliged " to sell the grid , and that the decision has been part of a longer-term plan since mid 2008 .
shedding regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vattenfall 's hatakka said the sale has been planned for years vattenfall 's german grid has a regulated value of 1.2 billion euros - nearly 50 percent more than the value of the sale .
heavy regulation in the energy market often translates to market values of grids being much lower than regulated values .
the grid serves about 18 million people in eastern and northern germany and covers 9,700 kilometers of high-voltage lines .
the sale increases elia 's holdings to 143,000 square kilometers serving 29 million customers .

the european commission has put pressure on major power companies in germany to break up production and distribution responsibilities to increase competition and lower prices. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .

on the third annual ' world day against cyber censorship ' reporters without borders has again warned of growing surveillance . the latest study by reporters without borders identified 12 " enemies of the internet " - especially in asia and the arab world .
among them are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran .
" in those countries control and surveillance of the world wide web is so strict that the internet is in fact more of an intranet , " says anja viohl , spokesperson of reporters without borders , an international organization fighting for press freedom .
china steps up its control it 's in those countries that bloggers and dissidents who use the internet are subject to repression and censorship .
china leads the way in terms of the technical effort and sophistication the authorities put into censoring online content . the country also has the largest online community with around 380 million users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google threatened to leave china after hacker attacks in january , us internet giant google had threatened to withdraw from the chinese market altogether .
the move came after hackers targeted google 's chinese service .
so far it 's not yet clear who was behind the attacks - the chinese government denies any involvement .
but regardless of whether or not beijing is responsible - there is little doubt that access to foreign websites is significantly limited across china .
sealing off the internet " the censorship by the communist government now affects almost all foreign web sites .
if you do n't actually have a chinese web address , then you 're likely to be entirely blocked so no one in china can access the site , " said adrienne woltersdorf , head of the chinese department at deutsche welle .
access to deutsche welle 's websites is strongly affected by the country 's censorship .
other international broadcasters like the bbc , voice of america and radio free asia have the same problem .
not only is critical news being blocked out , but competition on the media market is also significantly affected .
the us is currently considering taking china to court at the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- over censorship issues .
bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have identified 12 ' enemies of the internet ' - especially in asia and the arab world .
among those are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran surveilling , scanning , blocking behind china 's policy of censorship there is a sophisticated mechanism of control .
experts assume that around 40,000 state employees are keeping a close eye on the web .
all chinese e-mail traffic is copied and then scanned for sensitive words like " tianamen " - the same mechanism is used for scanning web sites .
according to reporters without borders , around 60 countries censored public access to the internet in 2009 .
there are some surprises in this list - countries like australia or south korea who have stepped up surveillance of the internet to combat child pornography .
globally some 120 bloggers and dissidents are under arrest for things they wrote on the internet .
deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf said a new approach was needed even in countries where freedom of speech is not infringed .
" the western world has to very carefully consider how to deal with regimes that so bluntly and systematically block free access to information on the internent . "

some nigerian traffickers are manipulating a belief in a traditional religion related to voodoo to intimidate their victims . a recent investigation of 600 brothels by the greman federal criminal police uncovered at least 170 nigerian women working illegally as prostitutes .
authorities determined that 50 of them were victims of human trafficking .
nigeria is one of many countries to have signed the united nations protocol against human trafficking .
but some nigerian women as young as 15 are still smuggled to germany and elsewhere in europe to work in the sex trade .
federal police inspector markus steiner has been checking on the brothels around frankfurt 's central train station , where the city 's red light district is located .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of trafficked women end up in frankfurt 's red light district " this is the neighborhood where a girl from a village in nigeria arrives .
in a foreign city where neither the language nor the culture is known to her , where fighting is normal and where even a german person would be uncomfortable , " steiner told deutsche welle .
one brothel he visits , a huge , red-lit house topped by sculptures of nude women , has a parking lot full of posh cars .
steiner said that more than 140 women work there , but the number of prostitutes working each day in the neighborhood around the train station totals about 500 .
" at the moment we might not find any african prostitutes , well no nigerians , anyway , " steiner said .
" for us this is a success .
but one has to admit that just because no nigerian victims are found here , that does n't mean there are fewer victims of human trafficking .
it just means that the victims have been sent to other cities like hanover , hamburg , stuttgart , munich and elsewhere in germany . "
' voodoo oath ' the nigerian trafficking networks frequently use a set of traditional beliefs , commonly referred to in the west as voodoo , to intimidate and manipulate their victims .
belief in voodoo is very strong in parts of nigeria , and the women are often forced to make an oath by one of the religion 's priests , in which they swear obedience to their trafficker or pimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's commonly called " voodoo " is a religion practiced in parts of africa , the americas and the carribbean most of the illegal nigerian prostitutes caught by the police have a lot of stories to tell , but getting them to talk can be difficult .
it takes a lot of experience and patience for police to get the real truth from these women - and only then are they able to help them .
because the police are aware of the dangers for trafficking victims who return home , the women are offered political asylum . ' not easy to say something ' ritha ekweza has been through this process .
she began working as a prostitute in germany in september 2007 .
after being caught , she testified in court in frankfurt against her sponsor .
after the trial , she explains with tears in her eyes how painful it was to have to recall everything she underwent during her time as a prostitute .
" it is not easy to stand and say something , but the thing is , when they bring the girls here , they will just tell them that everything is good , everything is easier , but when you come here it 's not the same situation , " said ekweza .
" they will bring you and take advantage of you . "
once ekweza was brought to europe , her traffickers informed her that she had to pay back some 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 82,000 -rrb- to them for her flight and other expenses .
she worked as a prostitute seven days a week , sometimes attending to more than 18 men a day , to pay off the debt .
in may 2008 , she was jailed in frankfurt for being an illegal prostitute .
but together with police and a local women 's rights ngo , she overcame her fear of breaking the voodoo oath .
she now works as a hairdresser , and has started a family .
she still receives counseling from a local ngo called fim , or women 's rights are human rights .
ekweza is one of more than 900 african women the organization serves as clients each year .
" we try to stabilize her , socially and psychologically , " said elvira niesner , a coordinator with fim .
" we look -lsb- to make sure -rsb- that she feels secure .
that is very important , and she will get the money from the officials to survive . "
but the biggest challenge remains that of countering the belief in voodoo , which complicates efforts to stop human trafficking from nigeria .
although police are able to help some women escape from the traffickers , most end up returning to prostitution .
they still want to fulfil their promise of paying back the 60,000 euros that they made in front of a priest in nigeria .

on the third annual ' world day against cyber censorship ' reporters without borders has again warned of growing surveillance . the latest study by reporters without borders identified 12 " enemies of the internet " - especially in asia and the arab world .
among them are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran .
" in those countries control and surveillance of the world wide web is so strict that the internet is in fact more of an intranet , " says anja viohl , spokesperson of reporters without borders , an international organization fighting for press freedom .
china steps up its control it 's in those countries that bloggers and dissidents who use the internet are subject to repression and censorship .
china leads the way in terms of the technical effort and sophistication the authorities put into censoring online content . the country also has the largest online community with around 380 million users .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google threatened to leave china after hacker attacks in january , us internet giant google had threatened to withdraw from the chinese market altogether .
the move came after hackers targeted google 's chinese service .
so far it 's not yet clear who was behind the attacks - the chinese government denies any involvement .
but regardless of whether or not beijing is responsible - there is little doubt that access to foreign websites is significantly limited across china .
sealing off the internet " the censorship by the communist government now affects almost all foreign web sites .
if you do n't actually have a chinese web address , then you 're likely to be entirely blocked so no one in china can access the site , " said adrienne woltersdorf , head of the chinese department at deutsche welle .
access to deutsche welle 's websites is strongly affected by the country 's censorship .
other international broadcasters like the bbc , voice of america and radio free asia have the same problem .
not only is critical news being blocked out , but competition on the media market is also significantly affected .
the us is currently considering taking china to court at the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- over censorship issues .
bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have identified 12 ' enemies of the internet ' - especially in asia and the arab world .
among those are countries like china , burma , north korea , saudi arabia and iran surveilling , scanning , blocking behind china 's policy of censorship there is a sophisticated mechanism of control .
experts assume that around 40,000 state employees are keeping a close eye on the web .
all chinese e-mail traffic is copied and then scanned for sensitive words like " tianamen " - the same mechanism is used for scanning web sites .
according to reporters without borders , around 60 countries censored public access to the internet in 2009 .
there are some surprises in this list - countries like australia or south korea who have stepped up surveillance of the internet to combat child pornography .
globally some 120 bloggers and dissidents are under arrest for things they wrote on the internet .
deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf said a new approach was needed even in countries where freedom of speech is not infringed .
" the western world has to very carefully consider how to deal with regimes that so bluntly and systematically block free access to information on the internent . "

" come april , 18-year-old lena meyer-landrut will be busily studying for her high school finals alongside most of her peers .
but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

but just a few weeks later , the hanover teenager will have an altogether different challenge to prepare for : singing for her country at the 2010 eurovision song contest in oslo .
" i 'm shaking all over .
i did n't think it would hit me like this .
this is really bad , it 's awesome , " said a teary meyer-landrut after the results of the telephone vote were announced .
the young singer earned her ticket to norway through the national televison casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- , in which she was the youngest contestant .
the show pitted singers from around the country against one another and each week , viewers would vote for the contestant they most wanted to represent germany at the eurovision song contest .
on friday night meyer-landrut ’ s performance of " satellite " saw her crowned winner of the show , edging out the 18-year-old runner-up jennifer braun .
odds on her side despite her youth , meyer-landrut has long been touted as a favorite to win .
she attributes her success to her determination to be herself on screen rather than adopt a false persona , and told deutsche welle that fans can expect to see more of this authenticity when she takes to the eurovision stage in may .
" i do think -lsb- my performance in oslo -rsb- will look like the performances here , " she said .
" i ’ m going to be fresh and funny as ever , like i ’ m always being … i hope that will be good . "
meyer-landrut said that when it comes time to live out her dream of performing at eurovision , she hopes to avoid the exaggerated kitsch that has come to define the song contest over the years : " the old tradition will not be in my -lsb- performance -rsb- . "
meyer-landrut is no stranger to the spotlight , having danced for many years .
throughout the preliminary casting show " our star for oslo , " meyer-landrut impressed audiences and judges alike with her onstage ease and versatility .
jury president -lrb- and former eurovision contestant -rrb- stefan raab commented , " you are a chameleon , a gazelle and a nightingale all at once . "
it is a flexibility reflected in her musical taste : the young singer ’ s favorite tunes range from jack johnson ’ s breezy pop to yann tierson ’ s beautifully eccentric compositions .
though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

though she does n't play a musical instrument , meyer-landrut has said that she would like to learn piano and guitar .
since filming for the casting show began in february , meyer-landrut has had little time for hanging out with friends , though they remain an important source of stability for her .
" they support me , and it ’ s so good to have them here , " she said , after a post-show huddle with a group of close friends .
punishing schedule these past few weeks , a typical day has meant at least two or three hours of rehearsing a day - and meyer-landrut will likely need to double these efforts in the lead-up to eurovision .
despite this , she continues to make time for her studies .
she says she must often shut herself away with her books in order to escape the distraction of endless rehearsals and performances .
" going to school is very important because i ’ m doing my exam , and i try to learn every day a bit , " she said .
" but it ’ s not that easy because we do have to learn the -lsb- lyrics -rsb- and the songs , the melodies ; i ’ m quite tired . "
but despite the grueling schedule , she said , the opportunity to live out her passion makes the hard work worthwhile : " when i do sing , it ’ s like everything ’ s away . "

in one central square hundreds of protesters threw stones and firebombs at riot police , who used baton-charges and tear gas in a bid to restrain the crowd .
police said two protesters and 13 police officers were injured , 16 demonstrators were also detained , nine of whom were later arrested .
police say that over 20,000 people lined the streets of athens for the demonstrations against severe government cost-cutting measures designed to help reduce greece 's runaway budget deficit .
chants and banners on the streets of the capital included messages like " plutocrats must pay for the crisis , " " we are men , not numbers , " and " europe must change , or it will sink . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 12.03.2010 six of the best : germany 's f1 hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumi and co are in bahrain for the first race of 2010 germany is threatening to monopolize the formula one grid nowadays , with no fewer than six drivers - that 's one quarter of the entire field - competing at bahrain this weekend .
dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .

dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de motor racing -pipe- 12.03.2010 six of the best : germany 's f1 hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumi and co are in bahrain for the first race of 2010 germany is threatening to monopolize the formula one grid nowadays , with no fewer than six drivers - that 's one quarter of the entire field - competing at bahrain this weekend .
dw profiles them all . a record six of the 24 formula one drivers competing in 2010 hail from germany . they are : michael schumacher age : 41 starts : 249 wins : 91 podiums : 154 best championship finish : 1st - 1994 , 95 , 2000 , 01 , 02 , 03 , 04 this man 's cv tells the whole story .
the most successful f1 driver in the history of the sport - by a considerable margin , for that matter - has returned after three years in retirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simply the best .
or certainly the most successful where to begin ?
schumacher 's unwavering professionalism and commitment , his supreme fitness and self-discipline , his ability to mold a team around him , his technical understanding and feel for developing a race car , and - of course - his metronomic and blistering pace all contributed to him becoming the dominant force in f1 for a decade .
but perhaps the defining characteristic of schumacher and his success was his ruthless determination , a hunger to triumph that made him one of the most polarizing figures in the sport - always lauded as one of the best of all time , but often criticized for not playing fair .
it would perhaps be asking too much to expect the 41-year-old to wind back the years and win championship number eight on his f1 return , but motorsport fans know that discounting michael schumacher from anything is extremely foolish .
sebastian vettel age : 22 starts : 46 wins : 5 podiums : 9 best championship finish : 2nd - 2009 .
schumacher might struggle to be the top german driver this year .
the bookmakers reckon sebastian vettel has a better shot at the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel won the last race of 2009 , and people expect many , many more dubbed " bubi schumi " -lrb- " baby schumi " -rrb- by the german press when he made his f1 debut as a teenager , he 's tipped to one day become a multiple world champion .
while vettel does n't monopolize the record books quite like schumacher , he 's already written his name into f1 history .
he is the youngest point-scorer , podium-finisher , and race-winner ever , and in 2009 he almost became the youngest world champion of all time , finishing a close second to jenson button .
vettel remains with the red bull team for 2010 , in a car penned by f1 design legend adrian newey .
newey made some of the very few cars that managed to beat schumacher in the 1990s -lrb- then at williams and mclaren -rrb- , and many pundits expect him to repeat that feat at red bull this year .
a massive monty python fan , vettel combines extreme confidence with an easy-going nature , and was on his way to becoming a darling of the german press last year .
however , a certain someone 's return to the sport might slow that process this season .
vettel 's driving style is extremely aggressive , and his early career was characterized by frequent mistakes and retirements , a problem he seemed to get a handle on in 2009 .
nico rosberg age : 24 starts : 70 wins : 0 podiums : 2 best championship finish : 7th - 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg probably expected a different teammate in 2010 most international f1 fans consider nico rosberg only an honorary german .
his father , 1982 world champion keke rosberg , was known as " the flying finn " , the first of a long line of world champions from finland .
however , nico 's mother is german , he was born in wiesbaden , and he 's always raced under a german license .
rosberg 's never won a race , but at williams he was a consistent over-achiever in a car that could n't compete at the front . however , critics point to repeated mistakes in those few races where he had the chance to score big , and say he ca n't handle the pressure of running near the front .
midway through last season , when rosberg 's move to brawn gp -lrb- now mercedes gp -rrb- was announced , many started tipping him as a possible world champion in 2010 .
then michael schumacher announced his return to the sport .
rosberg says his first goal is to win his first race , but his greatest challenge this season will be to achieve what no man ever has in f1 history - to beat schumi in the same car .
if age is on his side , history is not .
timo glock age : 27 -lrb- though only until march 18 -rrb- starts : 36 wins : 0 podiums : 3 best championship finish : 10th - 2009 being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not a recipe for success in motorsport , but it 's been a recurring theme of timo glock 's career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's new team virgin has forged a cool image ; now it needs a fast car he made a more than respectable debut in 2004 as a stand-in for jordan , a privateer team that was on its last legs .
when jordan quit at the end of that year , glock was lost in the formula one driver shuffle , and had to prove his mettle again in the lower formulas .
he fought his way back and secured a drive with toyota for 2008 , only for them to leave the sport at the end of last season , leaving timo homeless again .
glock , knowing the importance of finding an alternative quickly , signed up with one of this year 's three new teams , virgin racing .
the price of staying in the sport will be spending the early races , and probably the entire season , right at the back of the pack .
glock is known as a gutsy driver , who shines over race distances .
he was one of the most prolific overtakers of 2009 .
adrian sutil age : 27 starts : 52 wins : 0 podiums : 0 best championship finish : 17th - 2009 .
after three lackluster years , the sun might finally shine on adrian sutil in 2010 .
he stays with the force india team , but this year the outfit hopes it has progressed beyond its traditional backmarker status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to his parents ' dismay , sutil traded piano keys for steeering wheels at 14 sutil says he hopes to generally be " between 8th and 12th " in 2010 , which would represent a major improvement . depsite a lack of success , this talented pianist with latin american heritage has shown flashes of brilliance in his career .
but these moments have almost always been overshadowed either by horrendous misfortune or careless errors .
he has never finished higher than 4th , and has retired 22 times in his short career .
he 's garnered a reputation as a fast driver with real potential , who is also a bit of a crash-magnet .
this season is sutil 's chance to prove his critics wrong and finally secure his first podium .
but some people are tipping him to achieve even more than that .
nico hulkenberg age : 22 starts : 0 rookie nico hulkenberg makes his debut with nico rosberg 's old team , williams , this season .
he 's partnered with the most experienced driver in the history of the sport , brazilian rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debutant nico hulkenberg hopes to best his veteran teammate barrichello hulkenberg is the latest young starlet under the wing of michael schumacher 's manager willi weber and , like most young drivers to enter the sport , he 's being touted as " the next big thing . " he won the gp2 feeder championship at a canter in 2009 , and in his spare time he worked shifts at williams ' assembly plant in oxfordshire , learning how to build and fit various parts of the f1 cars he is now driving .
hulkenberg , like adrian sutil , is in a car that 's likely to be a solid midfield contender this season , perhaps capable of causing the occasional upset .
but the team has n't won a race in five seasons , the longest drought in williams ' history .
