a new trend sees the logo " wasted german youth " appearing on t-shirts , stickers , albums and at events around berlin .
while its message may seem fun and trivial , the business behind it has higher goals . the city of berlin - like most of the rest of us - invests in making a positive first impression on visitors , and the thousands of young berliners donning the viral slogan " wasted german youth " are n't helping paint a pretty image . it is a growing trend - and apart from t-shirts , the slogan can also be found on stickers and club posters all over the city and around the country . artist paul snowden , the designer behind " wasted german youth , " wanted his creation to reflect the rave-party lifestyle that gives the german capital its edgy reputation . " it 's an attitude and a lifestyle that a lot of people in the city live day-to-day , and the city has received international recognition for the lifestyle , " said snowden , a native of new zealand .
" and i think it 's a lifestyle that needs to be celebrated . " a spontaneous creation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least there 's lots of money to be made in the party business however , the idea for the slogan was not the result of a complicated creative process . " one sunday morning in 1999 , i thought ' these wasted german youth ' - it was just an observation , " explained snowden .
" five years later i got the logo together and started printing up t-shirts for friends of mine - they were also djs - so people just wanted the shirt .
i used to photocopy the stickers myself at a friend 's advertising agency and it just expanded from there . " berlin-based dj , recording artist and label boss alex ridha , known as boys noize , noticed the " wasted youth " stickers popping up all over the place , and he thinks that attitude has a lot to do with the slogan 's popularity . " -lsb- snowden -rsb- was always the guy with the understatement of being not part of the system - kind of a rebel , " said ridha .
" and i think a lot of people might not be like that , but they want to associate with this . " more than just fun considering this image , the latest development within the trend may be surprising for some .
titled " rave tut gut " -lrb- a play on words meaning both " rave does good things " and " rave is good for you " -rrb- , it involves the business donating proceeds to a children 's cancer foundation .
it has also set up a new method of hiring djs for dance parties . " we decided , ' why not ask the kids ? " ' said snowden .
" send us your mixes or upload the mixes to facebook and we 'll choose the best ones . " bildunterschrift : the slogan embodies a lifestyle " it 's really cool for an unknown dj to be associated with something like wasted german youth , " added ridha . so while snowden and boys noize travel the globe with the " rave tut gut " party , the djs of the future are coming into the spotlight . " it is not only a lifestyle - it 's a business , " said snowden .
" there are djs flying around the world and they 've become international names , you have designers and club owners and restaurant owners - and promote the parties .
it is an industry - it 's not just wasting away your life .
it is a business and there 's a lot of money involved . " while it may seem like just a party , or a silly logo with a few trivial words , perhaps being young , having a good time and doing what comes naturally is not such a waste of time after all .
plus , it makes berlin what it is . author : jonathan gifford / ew editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 01.12.2010 struggle to find an aids vaccine continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for an aids vaccine continues there has been a lot of hopeful progress made in the area of hiv vaccine research over the years , but many a setback as well .
one reason for this is that there are many different strains of hiv . since hiv , the virus that causes aids , was discovered in 1982 , scientists around the world have been trying to create a vaccine against it .
but 28 years later after its discovery , and 22 years after the first world aids day on december 1 , 1988 , the world is still waiting for the big breakthrough .
nevertheless , scientists have n't given up yet .
they know that a well tolerated , effective vaccine could effectively stop the worldwide spread of aids .
developing an aids vaccine is an ambitious undertaking .
there have been signs of promise , but setbacks as well , largely due to the changing nature of the virus .
the fact is , there is no single strain of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- , but many viruses , all of them slightly different .
" the virus is constantly changing , altering its structure , its genetic composition .
that makes it harder for the immune system to fight , " said gerd faetkenheuer , a professor at the university clinic in cologne , in an interview with deutsche welle .
when a person is infected with hiv , his or her immune system develops antibodies that fight the virus , but he or she is unable to stop it from spreading .
simulated antibodies created in the lab " everyone who is infected , every patient , has antibodies .
but these antibodies do n't protect against the virus - as a rule , they just indicate it , " faetkenheuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoms are still one of the best methods in aids prevention researchers have been able to create simulated antibodies in the lab that are better than natural ones .
they can protect people from numerous hiv strains and can even stop the virus from entering and infecting cells .
but it 's not clear whether these molecules will be able to function outside of the lab .
a further approach to vaccine research aims to teach the immune system what hiv-infected cells look like , so that the body can recognize the cells and get rid of them .
according to faetkenheuer , this kind of vaccine would n't be able to prevent infection , but could at least teach the body how to control it .
" we need immune cells that can recognize and kill the virus , " he said .
" a major problem in hiv infection is that the virus attacks the immune cells as well .
you can even say that it attacks the most important cells of the immune system - the helper cells .
they control the immuno-response . "
the thai exception none of the possible vaccines that have been tested on people so far have proved effective - with one exception .
in thailand , a combined vaccine was effective to a certain level .
its double aim was to stimulate antibody production while teaching the immune system to recognize infected cells .
in a test group , those vaccinated showed 31 percent fewer incidents of infection .
this is the first small success after a series of setbacks .
yet there is one major problem : to this day , researchers can not explain how the vaccine worked , and they are n't sure whether or not the results can be trusted .
" -lsb- 31 percent -rsb- is a very slight difference , which also can be affected by external factors , " faetkenheuer said .
" so we ca n't be sure if it was a real result , or if external factors that we have n't yet identified played a role . "
looking for answers in healthy populations researchers hope that a new , detailed analysis of the thai experiment - already underway - will bring an answer to this question .
results are expected in around two years .
so what does a vaccine need to be able to do in order to protect someone from contracting hiv ?
dr. bruce walker , an aids expert at boston university , is looking for the answer .
he is testing carriers of the hiv virus who have the unusual ability to control the virus to the point where it almost does n't replicate at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine tested in thailand has shown promise ; further studies are being done walker has discovered genetic material in these subjects that does n't exist in other hiv patients .
" the challenge is now for us to reach the point that we understand the mechanism and find out how to really control the virus , " he said .
but there is likely to be a long road before that point is reached .
there may never be a 100 percent reliable vaccine against hiv - but even a vaccine with a 50 or 60 percent protective effect could help to slow the spread of the virus , experts say .
multifaceted strategy for fighting the disease a complete disease-fighting strategy would n't rely entirely on the vaccine .
other techniques include : condoms , male circumcision , and medication .
because as it turns out , hiv-infected patients who are medically treated are less infectious , faetkenheuer said . " at present , the most successful tool we have is n't vaccination , it is treatment , " faetkenheuer said .
" when people are treated , it means that fewer people will be infected . "
the problem with that , however , is that even in wealthy europe , about half of the people who are hiv positive do n't know it .
" if they do n't do an aids test , they can infect other people without even wanting to , " said jens lundgren , a professor at the university of copenhagen . " they do n't know that they are a risk for their partner , and a risk for society . "
as ever , taking a simple aids test is one method for proving an existing infection - and for getting early treatment .
and it is still the surest way to know whether or not you could spread the virus to other people .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 01.12.2010 illegal arms shipments to nigeria raise stakes ahead of 2011 elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria wants to avoid the chaos and violence of 2007 general elections in nigeria are still several months away , but tensions are rising with memories still fresh of the 2007 poll which saw widespread allegations of corruption , voter fraud and violence . a nigerian court in late november charged an iranian and three nigerians over an illegal arms shipment seized in the main port of lagos and sent from iran .
the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .
in translated interview excerpts posted on the website of american broadcaster cnn , putin said if western missile defense installations were located near its borders , russia would have to " ensure its own security . " he said missile threats to europe needed to be tackled jointly .
putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .
putin 's remarks echoed those made on tuesday by russian president dmitry medvedev in a state of the nation address .
medvedev said failure by russia and the west to come to an agreement over a new european missile shield could trigger an arms race .
ratification uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia already has a considerable missile arsenal the warnings from the kremlin come amid uncertainty about whether the us senate will ratify start , a new strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty signed by us president barack obama and medvedev in april .
the treaty is seen as a keystone of better relations between the two countries .
moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .
but russia and nato agreed in lisbon this month to look into ways in which they could cooperate on a new continental shield .
the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 india proposes compromise on climate stumbling block großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates say china should be more accountable for its co2 emissions rich and poor countries are divided over several issues in cancun , including how to disburse climate finances and how to account for actions taken .
however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .
neither the us nor china is bound by the kyoto protocol .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .
" institutions and renowned personalities have lost face .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

he was trying to plug an information leak .
his bosses were let off the hook for lack of evidence . a former deutsche telekom security manager has been given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for his role in using telephone records to scrutinize executives , journalists and trade unionists from 2005 to 2006 .
identified as klaus t. , the 60-year-old admitted to having collected telephone data on 40 people .
he was trying to identify a leak in the company 's organizational structure after media reports surfaced about substantial layoff plans .
prosecutor ulrich kleuser described his actions as " an extreme attack on the freedom of the press and of information . "
klaus t. , who spent most of his life working for deutsche telekom , was accused of seven counts of illegal data use under the federal privacy act , along with fraud and embezzlement .
he had charged a third-party security company with the task of searching for patterns in the secretly collected telephone data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zumwinkel beat the privacy violation charge , but was convicted of tax evasion similar cases against deutsche telekom 's former ceo , kai-uwe ricke , and supervisory board chief klaus zumwinkel were dropped in june for lack of evidence .
though zumwinkel denied wrongdoing , journalists called his innocence into question at the time .
individual punishment although klaus t. acted independently and said he " deeply regretted " the " very big mistake , which he certainly would n't do again , " he also said his superiors " never questioned " his actions .
the sentence " certainly sends a signal , which partially is surprising to me , " oliver goenner , a bonn-area lawyer specializing in data protection , told deutsche welle .
the sentence is fairly harsh when one takes into account that in germany violation of the data protection act carries a maximum two-year sentence and violation of the telecommunications act carries a maximum of five years , goenner said .
one likely reason for the harsh sentence was that klaus t. was also accused of fraud and embezzlement .
however , in february three google executives were held responsible in italy for violating the privacy of a disabled boy who could be seen on youtube receiving a beating .
the two sentences show that attitudes towards privacy violations are changing , goenner said .
" the significant signal of this sentence is that data protection is no longer a problem which can be solved financially - that one can be held personally responsible and do jail time for violations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 melting himalayan glaciers herald floods and droughts for region großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melting glaciers will be a key talking point at cancun millions of asians depend on the great rivers that flow from the himalayas for their water supply .
yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new trend sees the logo " wasted german youth " appearing on t-shirts , stickers , albums and at events around berlin .
while its message may seem fun and trivial , the business behind it has higher goals . the city of berlin - like most of the rest of us - invests in making a positive first impression on visitors , and the thousands of young berliners donning the viral slogan " wasted german youth " are n't helping paint a pretty image . it is a growing trend - and apart from t-shirts , the slogan can also be found on stickers and club posters all over the city and around the country . artist paul snowden , the designer behind " wasted german youth , " wanted his creation to reflect the rave-party lifestyle that gives the german capital its edgy reputation . " it 's an attitude and a lifestyle that a lot of people in the city live day-to-day , and the city has received international recognition for the lifestyle , " said snowden , a native of new zealand .
" and i think it 's a lifestyle that needs to be celebrated . " a spontaneous creation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least there 's lots of money to be made in the party business however , the idea for the slogan was not the result of a complicated creative process . " one sunday morning in 1999 , i thought ' these wasted german youth ' - it was just an observation , " explained snowden .
" five years later i got the logo together and started printing up t-shirts for friends of mine - they were also djs - so people just wanted the shirt .
i used to photocopy the stickers myself at a friend 's advertising agency and it just expanded from there . " berlin-based dj , recording artist and label boss alex ridha , known as boys noize , noticed the " wasted youth " stickers popping up all over the place , and he thinks that attitude has a lot to do with the slogan 's popularity . " -lsb- snowden -rsb- was always the guy with the understatement of being not part of the system - kind of a rebel , " said ridha .
" and i think a lot of people might not be like that , but they want to associate with this . " more than just fun considering this image , the latest development within the trend may be surprising for some .
titled " rave tut gut " -lrb- a play on words meaning both " rave does good things " and " rave is good for you " -rrb- , it involves the business donating proceeds to a children 's cancer foundation .
it has also set up a new method of hiring djs for dance parties . " we decided , ' why not ask the kids ? " ' said snowden .
" send us your mixes or upload the mixes to facebook and we 'll choose the best ones . " bildunterschrift : the slogan embodies a lifestyle " it 's really cool for an unknown dj to be associated with something like wasted german youth , " added ridha . so while snowden and boys noize travel the globe with the " rave tut gut " party , the djs of the future are coming into the spotlight . " it is not only a lifestyle - it 's a business , " said snowden .
" there are djs flying around the world and they 've become international names , you have designers and club owners and restaurant owners - and promote the parties .
it is an industry - it 's not just wasting away your life .
it is a business and there 's a lot of money involved . " while it may seem like just a party , or a silly logo with a few trivial words , perhaps being young , having a good time and doing what comes naturally is not such a waste of time after all .
plus , it makes berlin what it is . author : jonathan gifford / ew editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts wikileaks revelations shed light on beijing 's attitude to pyongyang wikileaks revelations on iran create problems for gulf states european press review : wikileaks ' disclosures people -pipe- 01.12.2010 who is the man behind the wikileaks ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange is always on the move and keeps his location secret the website wikileaks has hit the headlines again for revealing diplomatic cables from us embassies around the world , and interpol has issued an arrest warrant for its founder .
but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 01.12.2010 wikileaks , central asia top concerns at osce summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags are out as the osce meets the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- does n't meet often , but it 's picked a tetchy time to do so .
ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .

he was trying to plug an information leak .
his bosses were let off the hook for lack of evidence . a former deutsche telekom security manager has been given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for his role in using telephone records to scrutinize executives , journalists and trade unionists from 2005 to 2006 .
identified as klaus t. , the 60-year-old admitted to having collected telephone data on 40 people .
he was trying to identify a leak in the company 's organizational structure after media reports surfaced about substantial layoff plans .
prosecutor ulrich kleuser described his actions as " an extreme attack on the freedom of the press and of information . "
klaus t. , who spent most of his life working for deutsche telekom , was accused of seven counts of illegal data use under the federal privacy act , along with fraud and embezzlement .
he had charged a third-party security company with the task of searching for patterns in the secretly collected telephone data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zumwinkel beat the privacy violation charge , but was convicted of tax evasion similar cases against deutsche telekom 's former ceo , kai-uwe ricke , and supervisory board chief klaus zumwinkel were dropped in june for lack of evidence .
though zumwinkel denied wrongdoing , journalists called his innocence into question at the time .
individual punishment although klaus t. acted independently and said he " deeply regretted " the " very big mistake , which he certainly would n't do again , " he also said his superiors " never questioned " his actions .
the sentence " certainly sends a signal , which partially is surprising to me , " oliver goenner , a bonn-area lawyer specializing in data protection , told deutsche welle .
the sentence is fairly harsh when one takes into account that in germany violation of the data protection act carries a maximum two-year sentence and violation of the telecommunications act carries a maximum of five years , goenner said .
one likely reason for the harsh sentence was that klaus t. was also accused of fraud and embezzlement .
however , in february three google executives were held responsible in italy for violating the privacy of a disabled boy who could be seen on youtube receiving a beating .
the two sentences show that attitudes towards privacy violations are changing , goenner said .
" the significant signal of this sentence is that data protection is no longer a problem which can be solved financially - that one can be held personally responsible and do jail time for violations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 india proposes compromise on climate stumbling block großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates say china should be more accountable for its co2 emissions rich and poor countries are divided over several issues in cancun , including how to disburse climate finances and how to account for actions taken .
however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .
neither the us nor china is bound by the kyoto protocol .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 01.12.2010 illegal arms shipments to nigeria raise stakes ahead of 2011 elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria wants to avoid the chaos and violence of 2007 general elections in nigeria are still several months away , but tensions are rising with memories still fresh of the 2007 poll which saw widespread allegations of corruption , voter fraud and violence . a nigerian court in late november charged an iranian and three nigerians over an illegal arms shipment seized in the main port of lagos and sent from iran .
the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .
neither the us nor china is bound by the kyoto protocol .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .

yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

he was trying to plug an information leak .
his bosses were let off the hook for lack of evidence . a former deutsche telekom security manager has been given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for his role in using telephone records to scrutinize executives , journalists and trade unionists from 2005 to 2006 .
identified as klaus t. , the 60-year-old admitted to having collected telephone data on 40 people .
he was trying to identify a leak in the company 's organizational structure after media reports surfaced about substantial layoff plans .
prosecutor ulrich kleuser described his actions as " an extreme attack on the freedom of the press and of information . "
klaus t. , who spent most of his life working for deutsche telekom , was accused of seven counts of illegal data use under the federal privacy act , along with fraud and embezzlement .
he had charged a third-party security company with the task of searching for patterns in the secretly collected telephone data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zumwinkel beat the privacy violation charge , but was convicted of tax evasion similar cases against deutsche telekom 's former ceo , kai-uwe ricke , and supervisory board chief klaus zumwinkel were dropped in june for lack of evidence .
though zumwinkel denied wrongdoing , journalists called his innocence into question at the time .
individual punishment although klaus t. acted independently and said he " deeply regretted " the " very big mistake , which he certainly would n't do again , " he also said his superiors " never questioned " his actions .
the sentence " certainly sends a signal , which partially is surprising to me , " oliver goenner , a bonn-area lawyer specializing in data protection , told deutsche welle .
the sentence is fairly harsh when one takes into account that in germany violation of the data protection act carries a maximum two-year sentence and violation of the telecommunications act carries a maximum of five years , goenner said .
one likely reason for the harsh sentence was that klaus t. was also accused of fraud and embezzlement .
however , in february three google executives were held responsible in italy for violating the privacy of a disabled boy who could be seen on youtube receiving a beating .
the two sentences show that attitudes towards privacy violations are changing , goenner said .
" the significant signal of this sentence is that data protection is no longer a problem which can be solved financially - that one can be held personally responsible and do jail time for violations , " he said .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

katharina weiss ' book " generation geil " -lrb- " generation cool " -rrb- aims to paint an accurate picture of what makes today 's young germans tick . " generation porno , " facebook-addicts , flatrate-drinkers - today 's young people in germany have garnered quite a few unflattering labels .
katharina weiss , a 16-year-old from a small village in bavaria , was fed up with being put in a box and went out to find out - and show the rest of germany - what her peers are really like . from sex , drugs and alcohol to religion , security and future plans , weiss proves that she and her generation ca n't be put in a box . deutsche welle : what was the concept of your new book " generation geil " ? katharina weiss : for the book i interviewed 20 young people from all over germany and asked them for their opinions about topics such as politics , love , religion , school , parents , sex , moral values and future opportunities .
there are really so few media platforms around today for young people to voice an opinion and for that reason an increasing number of adults are writing about young people .
i wanted to change that . the word " geil " can be translated into english as either " cool " or " horny . "
which meaning did you intend ? definitely cool .
i did n't mean horny at all ! from all the portraits of young people you featured in your book , do you have a favorite ? this guy called fabian was a real interview highlight for me .
he was a really charismatic personality and came out with the funniest stories with such an appealing streak of nihilism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still at school , katharina has no definite career plans yet but journalism could be an option the book has caused quite a splash for its frank opinions about school , sex and drugs .
did you set out to write something controversial ? i just wanted to present different lives and compose authentic portraits of people .
so far the feedback from people my age who have read the book has been very encouraging . was it easy to find a publisher ? actually , yes .
i really had a lot of luck there and everything happened insanely fast .
i saw an author on mtvhome.de and she had written a similar non-fiction portrait type book and i really liked this idea .
all i did was send the synopsis for my book to her publisher , shwartzkopf & schwartzkopf , and the rest was history . at 16 , you 're already a published author .
what are your career plans ? i still do n't have any definite ideas yet but obviously something like journalism interests me .
to be able to meet new people and have insight into their lives and stories is something which i find very appealing . what would be your advice for other young people who want to write a book ? i 'm not sure i am the right person to ask for advice to be honest .
i just had a lot of luck !
but in general , all i can say is : give it a try .
a year ago , i would never have imagined that i would publish a book . when you 're not making waves in the world of literature what do you like to get up to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out now from schwartzkopf & schwartzkopf i like photography a lot and especially like taking party pictures in clubs .
i 'm also a big film fan .
in addition i 'm responsible for putting together the youth page of our local newspaper . christmas is just around the corner : what would you like to find in your stocking on christmas morning ? well , here in bavaria we get a visit from the " christkind " -lsb- christ child -rsb- and i 'd be over the moon if he brought me tickets for next year 's rock am ring music festival ! interview : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 01.12.2010 struggle to find an aids vaccine continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for an aids vaccine continues there has been a lot of hopeful progress made in the area of hiv vaccine research over the years , but many a setback as well .
one reason for this is that there are many different strains of hiv . since hiv , the virus that causes aids , was discovered in 1982 , scientists around the world have been trying to create a vaccine against it .
but 28 years later after its discovery , and 22 years after the first world aids day on december 1 , 1988 , the world is still waiting for the big breakthrough .
nevertheless , scientists have n't given up yet .
they know that a well tolerated , effective vaccine could effectively stop the worldwide spread of aids .
developing an aids vaccine is an ambitious undertaking .
there have been signs of promise , but setbacks as well , largely due to the changing nature of the virus .
the fact is , there is no single strain of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- , but many viruses , all of them slightly different .
" the virus is constantly changing , altering its structure , its genetic composition .
that makes it harder for the immune system to fight , " said gerd faetkenheuer , a professor at the university clinic in cologne , in an interview with deutsche welle .
when a person is infected with hiv , his or her immune system develops antibodies that fight the virus , but he or she is unable to stop it from spreading .
simulated antibodies created in the lab " everyone who is infected , every patient , has antibodies .
but these antibodies do n't protect against the virus - as a rule , they just indicate it , " faetkenheuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoms are still one of the best methods in aids prevention researchers have been able to create simulated antibodies in the lab that are better than natural ones .
they can protect people from numerous hiv strains and can even stop the virus from entering and infecting cells .
but it 's not clear whether these molecules will be able to function outside of the lab .
a further approach to vaccine research aims to teach the immune system what hiv-infected cells look like , so that the body can recognize the cells and get rid of them .
according to faetkenheuer , this kind of vaccine would n't be able to prevent infection , but could at least teach the body how to control it .
" we need immune cells that can recognize and kill the virus , " he said .
" a major problem in hiv infection is that the virus attacks the immune cells as well .
you can even say that it attacks the most important cells of the immune system - the helper cells .
they control the immuno-response . "
the thai exception none of the possible vaccines that have been tested on people so far have proved effective - with one exception .
in thailand , a combined vaccine was effective to a certain level .
its double aim was to stimulate antibody production while teaching the immune system to recognize infected cells .
in a test group , those vaccinated showed 31 percent fewer incidents of infection .
this is the first small success after a series of setbacks .
yet there is one major problem : to this day , researchers can not explain how the vaccine worked , and they are n't sure whether or not the results can be trusted .
" -lsb- 31 percent -rsb- is a very slight difference , which also can be affected by external factors , " faetkenheuer said .
" so we ca n't be sure if it was a real result , or if external factors that we have n't yet identified played a role . "
looking for answers in healthy populations researchers hope that a new , detailed analysis of the thai experiment - already underway - will bring an answer to this question .
results are expected in around two years .
so what does a vaccine need to be able to do in order to protect someone from contracting hiv ?
dr. bruce walker , an aids expert at boston university , is looking for the answer .
he is testing carriers of the hiv virus who have the unusual ability to control the virus to the point where it almost does n't replicate at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine tested in thailand has shown promise ; further studies are being done walker has discovered genetic material in these subjects that does n't exist in other hiv patients .
" the challenge is now for us to reach the point that we understand the mechanism and find out how to really control the virus , " he said .
but there is likely to be a long road before that point is reached .
there may never be a 100 percent reliable vaccine against hiv - but even a vaccine with a 50 or 60 percent protective effect could help to slow the spread of the virus , experts say .
multifaceted strategy for fighting the disease a complete disease-fighting strategy would n't rely entirely on the vaccine .
other techniques include : condoms , male circumcision , and medication .
because as it turns out , hiv-infected patients who are medically treated are less infectious , faetkenheuer said . " at present , the most successful tool we have is n't vaccination , it is treatment , " faetkenheuer said .
" when people are treated , it means that fewer people will be infected . "
the problem with that , however , is that even in wealthy europe , about half of the people who are hiv positive do n't know it .
" if they do n't do an aids test , they can infect other people without even wanting to , " said jens lundgren , a professor at the university of copenhagen . " they do n't know that they are a risk for their partner , and a risk for society . "
as ever , taking a simple aids test is one method for proving an existing infection - and for getting early treatment .
and it is still the surest way to know whether or not you could spread the virus to other people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .
in translated interview excerpts posted on the website of american broadcaster cnn , putin said if western missile defense installations were located near its borders , russia would have to " ensure its own security . " he said missile threats to europe needed to be tackled jointly .
putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .

the treaty is seen as a keystone of better relations between the two countries .
moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .
but russia and nato agreed in lisbon this month to look into ways in which they could cooperate on a new continental shield .
the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.12.2010 viral youth slogan celebrates raver lifestyle that made berlin famous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's youth going to waste ?
a new trend sees the logo " wasted german youth " appearing on t-shirts , stickers , albums and at events around berlin .
while its message may seem fun and trivial , the business behind it has higher goals . the city of berlin - like most of the rest of us - invests in making a positive first impression on visitors , and the thousands of young berliners donning the viral slogan " wasted german youth " are n't helping paint a pretty image . it is a growing trend - and apart from t-shirts , the slogan can also be found on stickers and club posters all over the city and around the country . artist paul snowden , the designer behind " wasted german youth , " wanted his creation to reflect the rave-party lifestyle that gives the german capital its edgy reputation . " it 's an attitude and a lifestyle that a lot of people in the city live day-to-day , and the city has received international recognition for the lifestyle , " said snowden , a native of new zealand .
" and i think it 's a lifestyle that needs to be celebrated . " a spontaneous creation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least there 's lots of money to be made in the party business however , the idea for the slogan was not the result of a complicated creative process . " one sunday morning in 1999 , i thought ' these wasted german youth ' - it was just an observation , " explained snowden .
" five years later i got the logo together and started printing up t-shirts for friends of mine - they were also djs - so people just wanted the shirt .
i used to photocopy the stickers myself at a friend 's advertising agency and it just expanded from there . " berlin-based dj , recording artist and label boss alex ridha , known as boys noize , noticed the " wasted youth " stickers popping up all over the place , and he thinks that attitude has a lot to do with the slogan 's popularity . " -lsb- snowden -rsb- was always the guy with the understatement of being not part of the system - kind of a rebel , " said ridha .
" and i think a lot of people might not be like that , but they want to associate with this . " more than just fun considering this image , the latest development within the trend may be surprising for some .
titled " rave tut gut " -lrb- a play on words meaning both " rave does good things " and " rave is good for you " -rrb- , it involves the business donating proceeds to a children 's cancer foundation .
it has also set up a new method of hiring djs for dance parties . " we decided , ' why not ask the kids ? " ' said snowden .
" send us your mixes or upload the mixes to facebook and we 'll choose the best ones . " bildunterschrift : the slogan embodies a lifestyle " it 's really cool for an unknown dj to be associated with something like wasted german youth , " added ridha . so while snowden and boys noize travel the globe with the " rave tut gut " party , the djs of the future are coming into the spotlight . " it is not only a lifestyle - it 's a business , " said snowden .
" there are djs flying around the world and they 've become international names , you have designers and club owners and restaurant owners - and promote the parties .
it is an industry - it 's not just wasting away your life .
it is a business and there 's a lot of money involved . " while it may seem like just a party , or a silly logo with a few trivial words , perhaps being young , having a good time and doing what comes naturally is not such a waste of time after all .
plus , it makes berlin what it is . author : jonathan gifford / ew editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 india proposes compromise on climate stumbling block großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates say china should be more accountable for its co2 emissions rich and poor countries are divided over several issues in cancun , including how to disburse climate finances and how to account for actions taken .
however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .
neither the us nor china is bound by the kyoto protocol .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .
in translated interview excerpts posted on the website of american broadcaster cnn , putin said if western missile defense installations were located near its borders , russia would have to " ensure its own security . " he said missile threats to europe needed to be tackled jointly .
putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .
putin 's remarks echoed those made on tuesday by russian president dmitry medvedev in a state of the nation address .
medvedev said failure by russia and the west to come to an agreement over a new european missile shield could trigger an arms race .

the treaty is seen as a keystone of better relations between the two countries .
moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .
but russia and nato agreed in lisbon this month to look into ways in which they could cooperate on a new continental shield .
the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 01.12.2010 wikileaks , central asia top concerns at osce summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags are out as the osce meets the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- does n't meet often , but it 's picked a tetchy time to do so .
ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .

putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .

moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .

the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .
" institutions and renowned personalities have lost face .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

he was trying to plug an information leak .
his bosses were let off the hook for lack of evidence . a former deutsche telekom security manager has been given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for his role in using telephone records to scrutinize executives , journalists and trade unionists from 2005 to 2006 .
identified as klaus t. , the 60-year-old admitted to having collected telephone data on 40 people .
he was trying to identify a leak in the company 's organizational structure after media reports surfaced about substantial layoff plans .
prosecutor ulrich kleuser described his actions as " an extreme attack on the freedom of the press and of information . "
klaus t. , who spent most of his life working for deutsche telekom , was accused of seven counts of illegal data use under the federal privacy act , along with fraud and embezzlement .
he had charged a third-party security company with the task of searching for patterns in the secretly collected telephone data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zumwinkel beat the privacy violation charge , but was convicted of tax evasion similar cases against deutsche telekom 's former ceo , kai-uwe ricke , and supervisory board chief klaus zumwinkel were dropped in june for lack of evidence .
though zumwinkel denied wrongdoing , journalists called his innocence into question at the time .
individual punishment although klaus t. acted independently and said he " deeply regretted " the " very big mistake , which he certainly would n't do again , " he also said his superiors " never questioned " his actions .
the sentence " certainly sends a signal , which partially is surprising to me , " oliver goenner , a bonn-area lawyer specializing in data protection , told deutsche welle .
the sentence is fairly harsh when one takes into account that in germany violation of the data protection act carries a maximum two-year sentence and violation of the telecommunications act carries a maximum of five years , goenner said .
one likely reason for the harsh sentence was that klaus t. was also accused of fraud and embezzlement .
however , in february three google executives were held responsible in italy for violating the privacy of a disabled boy who could be seen on youtube receiving a beating .
the two sentences show that attitudes towards privacy violations are changing , goenner said .
" the significant signal of this sentence is that data protection is no longer a problem which can be solved financially - that one can be held personally responsible and do jail time for violations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 01.12.2010 illegal arms shipments to nigeria raise stakes ahead of 2011 elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria wants to avoid the chaos and violence of 2007 general elections in nigeria are still several months away , but tensions are rising with memories still fresh of the 2007 poll which saw widespread allegations of corruption , voter fraud and violence . a nigerian court in late november charged an iranian and three nigerians over an illegal arms shipment seized in the main port of lagos and sent from iran .
the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 01.12.2010 struggle to find an aids vaccine continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for an aids vaccine continues there has been a lot of hopeful progress made in the area of hiv vaccine research over the years , but many a setback as well .
one reason for this is that there are many different strains of hiv . since hiv , the virus that causes aids , was discovered in 1982 , scientists around the world have been trying to create a vaccine against it .
but 28 years later after its discovery , and 22 years after the first world aids day on december 1 , 1988 , the world is still waiting for the big breakthrough .
nevertheless , scientists have n't given up yet .
they know that a well tolerated , effective vaccine could effectively stop the worldwide spread of aids .
developing an aids vaccine is an ambitious undertaking .
there have been signs of promise , but setbacks as well , largely due to the changing nature of the virus .
the fact is , there is no single strain of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- , but many viruses , all of them slightly different .
" the virus is constantly changing , altering its structure , its genetic composition .
that makes it harder for the immune system to fight , " said gerd faetkenheuer , a professor at the university clinic in cologne , in an interview with deutsche welle .
when a person is infected with hiv , his or her immune system develops antibodies that fight the virus , but he or she is unable to stop it from spreading .
simulated antibodies created in the lab " everyone who is infected , every patient , has antibodies .
but these antibodies do n't protect against the virus - as a rule , they just indicate it , " faetkenheuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoms are still one of the best methods in aids prevention researchers have been able to create simulated antibodies in the lab that are better than natural ones .
they can protect people from numerous hiv strains and can even stop the virus from entering and infecting cells .
but it 's not clear whether these molecules will be able to function outside of the lab .
a further approach to vaccine research aims to teach the immune system what hiv-infected cells look like , so that the body can recognize the cells and get rid of them .
according to faetkenheuer , this kind of vaccine would n't be able to prevent infection , but could at least teach the body how to control it .
" we need immune cells that can recognize and kill the virus , " he said .
" a major problem in hiv infection is that the virus attacks the immune cells as well .
you can even say that it attacks the most important cells of the immune system - the helper cells .
they control the immuno-response . "
the thai exception none of the possible vaccines that have been tested on people so far have proved effective - with one exception .
in thailand , a combined vaccine was effective to a certain level .
its double aim was to stimulate antibody production while teaching the immune system to recognize infected cells .
in a test group , those vaccinated showed 31 percent fewer incidents of infection .
this is the first small success after a series of setbacks .
yet there is one major problem : to this day , researchers can not explain how the vaccine worked , and they are n't sure whether or not the results can be trusted .
" -lsb- 31 percent -rsb- is a very slight difference , which also can be affected by external factors , " faetkenheuer said .
" so we ca n't be sure if it was a real result , or if external factors that we have n't yet identified played a role . "
looking for answers in healthy populations researchers hope that a new , detailed analysis of the thai experiment - already underway - will bring an answer to this question .
results are expected in around two years .
so what does a vaccine need to be able to do in order to protect someone from contracting hiv ?
dr. bruce walker , an aids expert at boston university , is looking for the answer .
he is testing carriers of the hiv virus who have the unusual ability to control the virus to the point where it almost does n't replicate at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine tested in thailand has shown promise ; further studies are being done walker has discovered genetic material in these subjects that does n't exist in other hiv patients .
" the challenge is now for us to reach the point that we understand the mechanism and find out how to really control the virus , " he said .
but there is likely to be a long road before that point is reached .
there may never be a 100 percent reliable vaccine against hiv - but even a vaccine with a 50 or 60 percent protective effect could help to slow the spread of the virus , experts say .
multifaceted strategy for fighting the disease a complete disease-fighting strategy would n't rely entirely on the vaccine .
other techniques include : condoms , male circumcision , and medication .
because as it turns out , hiv-infected patients who are medically treated are less infectious , faetkenheuer said . " at present , the most successful tool we have is n't vaccination , it is treatment , " faetkenheuer said .
" when people are treated , it means that fewer people will be infected . "
the problem with that , however , is that even in wealthy europe , about half of the people who are hiv positive do n't know it .
" if they do n't do an aids test , they can infect other people without even wanting to , " said jens lundgren , a professor at the university of copenhagen . " they do n't know that they are a risk for their partner , and a risk for society . "
as ever , taking a simple aids test is one method for proving an existing infection - and for getting early treatment .
and it is still the surest way to know whether or not you could spread the virus to other people .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 india proposes compromise on climate stumbling block großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates say china should be more accountable for its co2 emissions rich and poor countries are divided over several issues in cancun , including how to disburse climate finances and how to account for actions taken .
however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 01.12.2010 pakistan rejects wikileaks disclosures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horror scenario for many is that pakistan 's nuclear arsenal could fall into the hands of militants leaked memos have revealed that there is great tension between the us and pakistan over nuclear arms security .
moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 01.12.2010 wikileaks , central asia top concerns at osce summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flags are out as the osce meets the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- does n't meet often , but it 's picked a tetchy time to do so .
ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .

he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "

they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .

he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "

bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .
in translated interview excerpts posted on the website of american broadcaster cnn , putin said if western missile defense installations were located near its borders , russia would have to " ensure its own security . " he said missile threats to europe needed to be tackled jointly .
putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .
putin 's remarks echoed those made on tuesday by russian president dmitry medvedev in a state of the nation address .
medvedev said failure by russia and the west to come to an agreement over a new european missile shield could trigger an arms race .

the treaty is seen as a keystone of better relations between the two countries .
moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .
but russia and nato agreed in lisbon this month to look into ways in which they could cooperate on a new continental shield .
the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 india proposes compromise on climate stumbling block großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates say china should be more accountable for its co2 emissions rich and poor countries are divided over several issues in cancun , including how to disburse climate finances and how to account for actions taken .
however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .
neither the us nor china is bound by the kyoto protocol .

however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .

but who is the man behind wikileaks ? for a man whose pioneering website claims to campaign for transparency , julian assange , the founder of wikileaks , is notoriously secretive .
most recently , assange 's elusiveness has triggered an interpol arrest warrant .
the france-based international police agency on tuesday placed him on their most-wanted list and alerted member states to arrest him if he is seen .
this follows an arrest warrant issued by sweden two weeks ago in connection with rape allegations .
assange has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed the swedish detention order .
meanwhile , us officials are considering charging him with espionage over the sensitive leaks .
' the people 's intelligence agency ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange says wikileaks is about truth , justice and transparency born in australia , 39-year-old -lrb- according to interpol - he does n't tell reporters his real date of birth -rrb- assange has become one of the most talked about figures in global news .
he has dubbed his website " the people 's intelligence agency " and is a thorn in the side of most national governments .
he has been called " reckless , " " a criminal " and " a terrorist . "
assange has told reporters that he had an unconventional childhood .
he attended 37 different schools as he moved around australia with his mother .
during his teenage years assange developed an interest and skill in computer hacking .
what started as a hobby saw him charged and convicted of 25 charges of hacking and related crimes in 1995 .
the judge ruled that his hacking was out of inquisitiveness rather than malice and assange only had to pay a small fine .
after his brush with crime , assange turned his talents in computer programming and cryptography to jobs in it and as a security consultant .
he spent three years working for an academic , suelette dreyfus , who was researching the emerging subversive side of the internet .
she described assange as a " very skilled researcher . "
he then founded wikileaks in 2006 with around 10 others from the human rights , media and technology fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials have said wikileaks puts innocent lives in danger constantly on the move wikileaks has no fixed office and no full-time members of staff .
volunteers said assange likes to keep their temporary locations secret so that they can not be targeted by those who may want to shut their operation down .
understandably for a former hacker , assange is keen to keep security tight and make sure that the wikileaks files and websites are impenetrable to outside interference .
those working for the site correspond with each other using secure online encrypted chat services , and assange himself reportedly regularly changes his email address and cell phone number .
the wikileaks sites run on more than 20 servers around the world and on hundreds of domain names .
the wikileaks founder fiercely defends his actions as being in the interest of truth , justice and transparency .
his supporters hold him up as a crusader for free speech .
assange claims the us state department is leading a conspiracy against him .
" it understands that we are a responsible organization , " he told journalists in jordan , " so it 's trying to make it as hard as possible for us to publish in the hope that it can get us not to publish anything at all . "

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere will meet with tech ceos on december 7 to talk about the next steps web services that assemble personal profiles would only be allowed if the people being profiled gave their consent or a there was a compelling reason for making such information public .
the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 01.12.2010 germany unveils plan to tighten internet privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tech industry wants to self-regulate when it comes to privacy germany has unveiled plans to tighten internet privacy , including opt-out rights on geo-location services and a ban on services that build profiles .
the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .

the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .
a number of nigerians were arrested in connection with the shipment . experts divided over whether armed conflict is possible while the alleged gambian connection suggests that the weapons caches may not have been intended for use in any military actions within nigeria , such scenarios can not be entirely ruled out .
nigeria will hold a presidential election on april 9 , 2011 .
parliamentary elections will be held a week earlier and voters will elect governors in the country 's 36 states to round off the process on april 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms may have been for rebels in the niger delta " there are worrying signs that some factions in nigeria are preparing to use force before , during or after the polls , " richard gowan , an africa expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" that 's not a surprise , as previous nigerian elections have seen episodes of violence and fraud . " the 2007 polls were marred by rigging and intimidation , leading observers to declare them not credible . " the nightmare scenario is that nigeria will follow a pattern similar to kenya 's in 2007 , with disorder escalating in sensitive parts of the country like the oil-rich niger delta , " gowan said .
" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections . " the whole issue of gun running in nigeria is rather over-exaggerated and in fact is to some extent only relevant to the niger delta , " bergstresser told deutsche welle .
" even this is an issue of the past because most relevant militias have made a peace deal with the federal government . " he said the violence evident in previous polls would not repeat itself . " as far as i am concerned , scenarios like the ones during the elections of 1999 , 2003 and 2007 , where powerful local godfathers in conjunction with militias of different factions decided the voting in their areas by the gun , will not happen again during the forthcoming elections , " bergstresser said . elections key to nigeria 's future after the chaos and conflict of the previous ballot , the pressure is on for nigeria to conduct peaceful and credible elections in april 2011 .
there are more than just seats of power at issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigeria has huge oil and natural gas reserves " this election is a fight between groups over the access to resources and money , as it always has been throughout nigerian history , " jocker said .
" it is also a fight between religions , again , like most of nigeria 's struggles . "
nigeria is divided between the mostly muslim north and largely christian south . " the current nigerian political system in general and the political class in particular are at stake in these elections , " bergstresser said .
" the elites want to stabilize the still fragile political system under a democratic dispensation to make sure that their unwritten consensus concerning the distribution of the country 's wealth among themselves can continue as friction-free as possible - at least for the forseeable future . " security and stability in nigeria is as much an international concern as it is a domestic one as the elections get nearer .
a number of global players are monitoring the situation ahead of the poll , with many harboring similar agendas to those factions vying for power in nigeria itself . " african and western diplomats are watching the run-up to nigeria 's elections very closely , " gowan said .
" nigeria is not only by far the strongest state in west africa and the key to stability throughout the region , but it 's a major energy producer . " as a nation with such abundant natural resources , nigeria is a country of interest for as many states as there are reasons for them to meddle .
the united states has stepped up its influence in recent years by increasing military support , training and cooperation in nigeria in an attempt to shore up the country 's us-friendly government . " the us , as the most important external interest party and nigeria 's biggest oil and gas importer , has a vested interest in having a stable and , on the surface at least , a democratic , legitimized government , " said bergstresser .
" nigeria is considered a major african player and seen as a prominent actor in the us-africa relationship . " china , russia , and india also had geopolitical , economic and strategic interests in west africa and the gulf of guinea , which belong to the biggest gas reserves in the world , he added . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 01.12.2010 struggle to find an aids vaccine continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for an aids vaccine continues there has been a lot of hopeful progress made in the area of hiv vaccine research over the years , but many a setback as well .
one reason for this is that there are many different strains of hiv . since hiv , the virus that causes aids , was discovered in 1982 , scientists around the world have been trying to create a vaccine against it .
but 28 years later after its discovery , and 22 years after the first world aids day on december 1 , 1988 , the world is still waiting for the big breakthrough .
nevertheless , scientists have n't given up yet .
they know that a well tolerated , effective vaccine could effectively stop the worldwide spread of aids .
developing an aids vaccine is an ambitious undertaking .
there have been signs of promise , but setbacks as well , largely due to the changing nature of the virus .
the fact is , there is no single strain of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- , but many viruses , all of them slightly different .
" the virus is constantly changing , altering its structure , its genetic composition .
that makes it harder for the immune system to fight , " said gerd faetkenheuer , a professor at the university clinic in cologne , in an interview with deutsche welle .
when a person is infected with hiv , his or her immune system develops antibodies that fight the virus , but he or she is unable to stop it from spreading .
simulated antibodies created in the lab " everyone who is infected , every patient , has antibodies .
but these antibodies do n't protect against the virus - as a rule , they just indicate it , " faetkenheuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoms are still one of the best methods in aids prevention researchers have been able to create simulated antibodies in the lab that are better than natural ones .
they can protect people from numerous hiv strains and can even stop the virus from entering and infecting cells .
but it 's not clear whether these molecules will be able to function outside of the lab .
a further approach to vaccine research aims to teach the immune system what hiv-infected cells look like , so that the body can recognize the cells and get rid of them .
according to faetkenheuer , this kind of vaccine would n't be able to prevent infection , but could at least teach the body how to control it .
" we need immune cells that can recognize and kill the virus , " he said .
" a major problem in hiv infection is that the virus attacks the immune cells as well .
you can even say that it attacks the most important cells of the immune system - the helper cells .
they control the immuno-response . "
the thai exception none of the possible vaccines that have been tested on people so far have proved effective - with one exception .
in thailand , a combined vaccine was effective to a certain level .
its double aim was to stimulate antibody production while teaching the immune system to recognize infected cells .
in a test group , those vaccinated showed 31 percent fewer incidents of infection .
this is the first small success after a series of setbacks .
yet there is one major problem : to this day , researchers can not explain how the vaccine worked , and they are n't sure whether or not the results can be trusted .
" -lsb- 31 percent -rsb- is a very slight difference , which also can be affected by external factors , " faetkenheuer said .
" so we ca n't be sure if it was a real result , or if external factors that we have n't yet identified played a role . "
looking for answers in healthy populations researchers hope that a new , detailed analysis of the thai experiment - already underway - will bring an answer to this question .
results are expected in around two years .
so what does a vaccine need to be able to do in order to protect someone from contracting hiv ?
dr. bruce walker , an aids expert at boston university , is looking for the answer .
he is testing carriers of the hiv virus who have the unusual ability to control the virus to the point where it almost does n't replicate at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine tested in thailand has shown promise ; further studies are being done walker has discovered genetic material in these subjects that does n't exist in other hiv patients .
" the challenge is now for us to reach the point that we understand the mechanism and find out how to really control the virus , " he said .
but there is likely to be a long road before that point is reached .
there may never be a 100 percent reliable vaccine against hiv - but even a vaccine with a 50 or 60 percent protective effect could help to slow the spread of the virus , experts say .
multifaceted strategy for fighting the disease a complete disease-fighting strategy would n't rely entirely on the vaccine .
other techniques include : condoms , male circumcision , and medication .
because as it turns out , hiv-infected patients who are medically treated are less infectious , faetkenheuer said . " at present , the most successful tool we have is n't vaccination , it is treatment , " faetkenheuer said .
" when people are treated , it means that fewer people will be infected . "
the problem with that , however , is that even in wealthy europe , about half of the people who are hiv positive do n't know it .
" if they do n't do an aids test , they can infect other people without even wanting to , " said jens lundgren , a professor at the university of copenhagen . " they do n't know that they are a risk for their partner , and a risk for society . "
as ever , taking a simple aids test is one method for proving an existing infection - and for getting early treatment .
and it is still the surest way to know whether or not you could spread the virus to other people .

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out .

he was trying to plug an information leak .
his bosses were let off the hook for lack of evidence . a former deutsche telekom security manager has been given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for his role in using telephone records to scrutinize executives , journalists and trade unionists from 2005 to 2006 .
identified as klaus t. , the 60-year-old admitted to having collected telephone data on 40 people .
he was trying to identify a leak in the company 's organizational structure after media reports surfaced about substantial layoff plans .
prosecutor ulrich kleuser described his actions as " an extreme attack on the freedom of the press and of information . "
klaus t. , who spent most of his life working for deutsche telekom , was accused of seven counts of illegal data use under the federal privacy act , along with fraud and embezzlement .
he had charged a third-party security company with the task of searching for patterns in the secretly collected telephone data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zumwinkel beat the privacy violation charge , but was convicted of tax evasion similar cases against deutsche telekom 's former ceo , kai-uwe ricke , and supervisory board chief klaus zumwinkel were dropped in june for lack of evidence .
though zumwinkel denied wrongdoing , journalists called his innocence into question at the time .
individual punishment although klaus t. acted independently and said he " deeply regretted " the " very big mistake , which he certainly would n't do again , " he also said his superiors " never questioned " his actions .
the sentence " certainly sends a signal , which partially is surprising to me , " oliver goenner , a bonn-area lawyer specializing in data protection , told deutsche welle .
the sentence is fairly harsh when one takes into account that in germany violation of the data protection act carries a maximum two-year sentence and violation of the telecommunications act carries a maximum of five years , goenner said .
one likely reason for the harsh sentence was that klaus t. was also accused of fraud and embezzlement .
however , in february three google executives were held responsible in italy for violating the privacy of a disabled boy who could be seen on youtube receiving a beating .
the two sentences show that attitudes towards privacy violations are changing , goenner said .
" the significant signal of this sentence is that data protection is no longer a problem which can be solved financially - that one can be held personally responsible and do jail time for violations , " he said .

moreover , pakistani president asif ali zardari comes across as being paranoid about being assassinated . that pakistan 's nuclear weapons could get into the hands of terrorists is a known horror scenario . but according to the latest revelations by the controversial wikileaks website the us seems to be even more worried about pakistan 's nuclear arsenal than has been previously maintained . one cable apparently warned in 2008 that pakistan was " producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world . " last year , the then us ambassador to pakistan anne patterson is revealed to have said the main concern is not that islamist militants will get hold of an " entire weapon but that someone working in government of pakistan facilities could gradually smuggle enough material out to eventually make a weapon . " a statement issued by pakistani prime minister yousuf raza gilani 's office on wednesday condemned the leaks , saying they were " misleading " and " malicious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some disclosed documents suggest pakistan 's president asif ali zardari is worried about being assassinated a foreign ministry spokesman meanwhile said they were " condescending " .
he also pointed out that there had not been a " single incident " involving pakistan 's fissile material – a reflection of strong " controls and mechanisms " . drone strikes apparently tolerated another controversial matter brought up in the cables is us frustration that pakistan seems reluctant to cut off ties with extremists , such as lashkar-e-taiba , accused of being behind the november 2008 mumbai attacks . one of the reasons for this reluctance , the cables speculate , is that pakistan wants to maintain as much influence in afghanistan as possible . tied in with this is a secret cable sent by ambassador paterson suggesting that pakistani prime minister yusuf raza gilani said that us drone strikes on pakistan 's autonomous tribal regions would be unofficially tolerated but publicly condemned . this disclosure was also refuted by pakistan 's foreign ministry on wednesday .
the official line that un drone attacks breach pakistan 's sovereignty and are having long-term negative consequences was reiterated . zardari fears coup or assassination bildunterschrift : the leaks suggest that pakistan 's pm unofficially gave the green light for us drone attacks another story which has been given prominent attention regards president asif ali zardari who apparently has made preparations for his assassination or a coup . one of the documents talks about a conversation that took place in january 2009 between us vice president joe biden and britain 's prime minister gordon brown .
president zardari is said to have told biden that pakistani army chief general ashfaq kayani and the secret services were going to " take him out . " it is no secret in pakistan that there is tension between zardari and the army and rumors of possible coups are not rare . political analyst irfan siddiqi told deutsche welle that the wikileaks revelations could have a powerful impact in pakistan . " i feel that nothing is sacred in pakistan , " he said .
" institutions and renowned personalities have lost face .

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.12.2010 viral youth slogan celebrates raver lifestyle that made berlin famous großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's youth going to waste ?
a new trend sees the logo " wasted german youth " appearing on t-shirts , stickers , albums and at events around berlin .
while its message may seem fun and trivial , the business behind it has higher goals . the city of berlin - like most of the rest of us - invests in making a positive first impression on visitors , and the thousands of young berliners donning the viral slogan " wasted german youth " are n't helping paint a pretty image . it is a growing trend - and apart from t-shirts , the slogan can also be found on stickers and club posters all over the city and around the country . artist paul snowden , the designer behind " wasted german youth , " wanted his creation to reflect the rave-party lifestyle that gives the german capital its edgy reputation . " it 's an attitude and a lifestyle that a lot of people in the city live day-to-day , and the city has received international recognition for the lifestyle , " said snowden , a native of new zealand .
" and i think it 's a lifestyle that needs to be celebrated . " a spontaneous creation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least there 's lots of money to be made in the party business however , the idea for the slogan was not the result of a complicated creative process . " one sunday morning in 1999 , i thought ' these wasted german youth ' - it was just an observation , " explained snowden .
" five years later i got the logo together and started printing up t-shirts for friends of mine - they were also djs - so people just wanted the shirt .
i used to photocopy the stickers myself at a friend 's advertising agency and it just expanded from there . " berlin-based dj , recording artist and label boss alex ridha , known as boys noize , noticed the " wasted youth " stickers popping up all over the place , and he thinks that attitude has a lot to do with the slogan 's popularity . " -lsb- snowden -rsb- was always the guy with the understatement of being not part of the system - kind of a rebel , " said ridha .
" and i think a lot of people might not be like that , but they want to associate with this . " more than just fun considering this image , the latest development within the trend may be surprising for some .
titled " rave tut gut " -lrb- a play on words meaning both " rave does good things " and " rave is good for you " -rrb- , it involves the business donating proceeds to a children 's cancer foundation .
it has also set up a new method of hiring djs for dance parties . " we decided , ' why not ask the kids ? " ' said snowden .
" send us your mixes or upload the mixes to facebook and we 'll choose the best ones . " bildunterschrift : the slogan embodies a lifestyle " it 's really cool for an unknown dj to be associated with something like wasted german youth , " added ridha . so while snowden and boys noize travel the globe with the " rave tut gut " party , the djs of the future are coming into the spotlight . " it is not only a lifestyle - it 's a business , " said snowden .
" there are djs flying around the world and they 've become international names , you have designers and club owners and restaurant owners - and promote the parties .
it is an industry - it 's not just wasting away your life .
it is a business and there 's a lot of money involved . " while it may seem like just a party , or a silly logo with a few trivial words , perhaps being young , having a good time and doing what comes naturally is not such a waste of time after all .
plus , it makes berlin what it is . author : jonathan gifford / ew editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our readers shared their thoughts on the situation , with some happier than others . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .
why should it continue to be so important to keep people blind to the truth ? - nina , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

katharina weiss ' book " generation geil " -lrb- " generation cool " -rrb- aims to paint an accurate picture of what makes today 's young germans tick . " generation porno , " facebook-addicts , flatrate-drinkers - today 's young people in germany have garnered quite a few unflattering labels .
katharina weiss , a 16-year-old from a small village in bavaria , was fed up with being put in a box and went out to find out - and show the rest of germany - what her peers are really like . from sex , drugs and alcohol to religion , security and future plans , weiss proves that she and her generation ca n't be put in a box . deutsche welle : what was the concept of your new book " generation geil " ? katharina weiss : for the book i interviewed 20 young people from all over germany and asked them for their opinions about topics such as politics , love , religion , school , parents , sex , moral values and future opportunities .
there are really so few media platforms around today for young people to voice an opinion and for that reason an increasing number of adults are writing about young people .
i wanted to change that . the word " geil " can be translated into english as either " cool " or " horny . "
which meaning did you intend ? definitely cool .
i did n't mean horny at all ! from all the portraits of young people you featured in your book , do you have a favorite ? this guy called fabian was a real interview highlight for me .
he was a really charismatic personality and came out with the funniest stories with such an appealing streak of nihilism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still at school , katharina has no definite career plans yet but journalism could be an option the book has caused quite a splash for its frank opinions about school , sex and drugs .
did you set out to write something controversial ? i just wanted to present different lives and compose authentic portraits of people .
so far the feedback from people my age who have read the book has been very encouraging . was it easy to find a publisher ? actually , yes .
i really had a lot of luck there and everything happened insanely fast .
i saw an author on mtvhome.de and she had written a similar non-fiction portrait type book and i really liked this idea .
all i did was send the synopsis for my book to her publisher , shwartzkopf & schwartzkopf , and the rest was history . at 16 , you 're already a published author .
what are your career plans ? i still do n't have any definite ideas yet but obviously something like journalism interests me .
to be able to meet new people and have insight into their lives and stories is something which i find very appealing . what would be your advice for other young people who want to write a book ? i 'm not sure i am the right person to ask for advice to be honest .
i just had a lot of luck !
but in general , all i can say is : give it a try .
a year ago , i would never have imagined that i would publish a book . when you 're not making waves in the world of literature what do you like to get up to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out now from schwartzkopf & schwartzkopf i like photography a lot and especially like taking party pictures in clubs .
i 'm also a big film fan .
in addition i 'm responsible for putting together the youth page of our local newspaper . christmas is just around the corner : what would you like to find in your stocking on christmas morning ? well , here in bavaria we get a visit from the " christkind " -lsb- christ child -rsb- and i 'd be over the moon if he brought me tickets for next year 's rock am ring music festival ! interview : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

seoul has announced more exercises near the border with the north . the us and south korean navies ended a major show of strength on wednesday that was intended to deter north korea from repeating last week 's deadly artillery bombardment . it was the two allies ' biggest-ever joint maneuver , with jet fighters thundering through the sky above a us carrier battle group . but whether the exercises will have the intended impact is doubtful .
south korea 's national intelligence service head wen sei-hoon was quoted on wednesday as telling a closed session of parliament that " the danger of further attacks from north korea is high . " one reason is that the north korean dictatorship has an intrinsic need for tension , explained ruediger frank from the university of vienna .
" past experience tells us that the north korean system is not only designed to deal with outside pressure but that it actually needs outside pressure for survival , " he said . " it is a fairly simple mechanism - if a country feels threatened , the population is much more willing to forego civil liberties or to accept economic shortcomings . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has announced a new round of war games next week part of ongoing succession game he added that the inbuilt tendency to create tension might have gained momentum because of the current leadership succession . frank also explained that the chances were " high " that kim jong-un , the grandson of state founder kim il-sung and likely successor to the current " dear leader " , was trying to create an " image – not just among the general population , but among the elites as well .
they are asking themselves whether the new leadership is going to further their interests as they want . " so behaving like a " spoiled child " to gain attention , as chinese diplomats have been quoted by wikileaks as saying , could be a survival technique . china wants to help ' resolve ' dispute wikileaks ' disclosures regarding the apparent willingness of the chinese political establishment to ditch north korea were sensational .
beijing has refused to comment on the revelations . regarding the conflict on the korean peninsula meanwhile , china said on wednesday that it did not favor either side but wanted to help " resolve " the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean soldiers near the military demarcation line in south korea 's demilitarized zone so far , china has protected north korea from censure by the un security council for last week 's deadly artillery shelling of yeonpyeong and the chinese foreign ministry has called for all parties involved in the crisis to avoid any action that could inflame the situation . " china 's main interest is to preserve stability and security , " said frank .
" for economic reasons , too .
foreign investors don ’ t like to see firefights on the korean peninsula .
and the chinese know that they have time on their side .
in ten or 15 years ' time , the korean question will look totally different . " but for the time being , the tension is likely to remain high .

against the current – urban exodus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the country-city-flight empties rural areas in africa , big city slums are growing to the bursting point .
the protagonists in our radio drama bust the trend and decide to move back to their village . seeing no chances of earning a living in the country , many opt to try their luck in the next big city .
but it is not that easy to gain a foothold in the over-crowded urban centres of the african continent .
on their arrival a lot of migrants realize that it is not the promised land they had dreamt of , with a high living standard and jobs in abundance . in our new learning by ear series ben and his friends baki and zeina decide to strive against the stream .
appalled by the lack of prospects in the city , these three young university graduates plan to set up an agricultural cooperative in their home village . many challenges await them and will put their motivation to a tough test .
where will they get the financial means to get started ?
how will the villagers welcome their project ?
and what kind of crop is the best investment for the future and is at the same time profitable ?

seoul has announced more exercises near the border with the north . the us and south korean navies ended a major show of strength on wednesday that was intended to deter north korea from repeating last week 's deadly artillery bombardment . it was the two allies ' biggest-ever joint maneuver , with jet fighters thundering through the sky above a us carrier battle group . but whether the exercises will have the intended impact is doubtful .
south korea 's national intelligence service head wen sei-hoon was quoted on wednesday as telling a closed session of parliament that " the danger of further attacks from north korea is high . " one reason is that the north korean dictatorship has an intrinsic need for tension , explained ruediger frank from the university of vienna .
" past experience tells us that the north korean system is not only designed to deal with outside pressure but that it actually needs outside pressure for survival , " he said . " it is a fairly simple mechanism - if a country feels threatened , the population is much more willing to forego civil liberties or to accept economic shortcomings . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south korea has announced a new round of war games next week part of ongoing succession game he added that the inbuilt tendency to create tension might have gained momentum because of the current leadership succession . frank also explained that the chances were " high " that kim jong-un , the grandson of state founder kim il-sung and likely successor to the current " dear leader " , was trying to create an " image – not just among the general population , but among the elites as well .
they are asking themselves whether the new leadership is going to further their interests as they want . " so behaving like a " spoiled child " to gain attention , as chinese diplomats have been quoted by wikileaks as saying , could be a survival technique . china wants to help ' resolve ' dispute wikileaks ' disclosures regarding the apparent willingness of the chinese political establishment to ditch north korea were sensational .
beijing has refused to comment on the revelations . regarding the conflict on the korean peninsula meanwhile , china said on wednesday that it did not favor either side but wanted to help " resolve " the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean soldiers near the military demarcation line in south korea 's demilitarized zone so far , china has protected north korea from censure by the un security council for last week 's deadly artillery shelling of yeonpyeong and the chinese foreign ministry has called for all parties involved in the crisis to avoid any action that could inflame the situation . " china 's main interest is to preserve stability and security , " said frank .
" for economic reasons , too .
foreign investors don ’ t like to see firefights on the korean peninsula .
and the chinese know that they have time on their side .
in ten or 15 years ' time , the korean question will look totally different . " but for the time being , the tension is likely to remain high .
according to the south korean yonhap news agency , seoul is already planning another round of war games close to the disputed sea border .
they are set to start next monday . author : matthias von hein editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new trend sees the logo " wasted german youth " appearing on t-shirts , stickers , albums and at events around berlin .
while its message may seem fun and trivial , the business behind it has higher goals . the city of berlin - like most of the rest of us - invests in making a positive first impression on visitors , and the thousands of young berliners donning the viral slogan " wasted german youth " are n't helping paint a pretty image . it is a growing trend - and apart from t-shirts , the slogan can also be found on stickers and club posters all over the city and around the country . artist paul snowden , the designer behind " wasted german youth , " wanted his creation to reflect the rave-party lifestyle that gives the german capital its edgy reputation . " it 's an attitude and a lifestyle that a lot of people in the city live day-to-day , and the city has received international recognition for the lifestyle , " said snowden , a native of new zealand .
" and i think it 's a lifestyle that needs to be celebrated . " a spontaneous creation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least there 's lots of money to be made in the party business however , the idea for the slogan was not the result of a complicated creative process . " one sunday morning in 1999 , i thought ' these wasted german youth ' - it was just an observation , " explained snowden .
" five years later i got the logo together and started printing up t-shirts for friends of mine - they were also djs - so people just wanted the shirt .
i used to photocopy the stickers myself at a friend 's advertising agency and it just expanded from there . " berlin-based dj , recording artist and label boss alex ridha , known as boys noize , noticed the " wasted youth " stickers popping up all over the place , and he thinks that attitude has a lot to do with the slogan 's popularity . " -lsb- snowden -rsb- was always the guy with the understatement of being not part of the system - kind of a rebel , " said ridha .
" and i think a lot of people might not be like that , but they want to associate with this . " more than just fun considering this image , the latest development within the trend may be surprising for some .
titled " rave tut gut " -lrb- a play on words meaning both " rave does good things " and " rave is good for you " -rrb- , it involves the business donating proceeds to a children 's cancer foundation .
it has also set up a new method of hiring djs for dance parties . " we decided , ' why not ask the kids ? " ' said snowden .
" send us your mixes or upload the mixes to facebook and we 'll choose the best ones . " bildunterschrift : the slogan embodies a lifestyle " it 's really cool for an unknown dj to be associated with something like wasted german youth , " added ridha . so while snowden and boys noize travel the globe with the " rave tut gut " party , the djs of the future are coming into the spotlight . " it is not only a lifestyle - it 's a business , " said snowden .
" there are djs flying around the world and they 've become international names , you have designers and club owners and restaurant owners - and promote the parties .
it is an industry - it 's not just wasting away your life .
it is a business and there 's a lot of money involved . " while it may seem like just a party , or a silly logo with a few trivial words , perhaps being young , having a good time and doing what comes naturally is not such a waste of time after all .
plus , it makes berlin what it is . author : jonathan gifford / ew editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who is the man behind wikileaks ?
well , so far wiki has n't leaked a thing the world did n't already know anyway .
mostly we " discover " that those arrogant american politicians have no respect for foreign people including foreign politicians - as if that were news we did n't know all along already .
we " discover " that china is getting irritated with north korea which is nothing new .
we " discover " that the british royal family is arrogant as if we ever would have had any doubts about that .
we " discover " that the saudi royalty has no respect for human rights as if that were news .
what exactly is the hoopla about wikileaks all about ?
maybe it will teach american " diplomats " not to be so arrogant , judgmental , and rude but i doubt they can change their nature .
this entire hoopla must be a joke . - anne , us please tell me , what is new in these so-called " revelations ? "
all the comments made on european " personalities " seem to be , by and large , correct e.g. merkel , westerwelle , seehofer , etc .
the whole wikileaks thing is an overblown media circus .
and in any case , what have we said about the likes of bush and cheney ? - peter , germany i believe that wikileaks should not release those documents .
extreme care should be exercised when making any piece of information public - this is part of responsible reporting .
yes , it 's good to be able to exercise freedom of expression ... but it is better to exercise freedom of expression with care and utmost consideration of the consequences .
we want to preserve that freedom and put it to good use for the betterment of our lives .
if wikileaks releases those documents believing that it 's exercising its freedom of expression , it is missing something as far as responsible reporting is concerned .
therefore , in my opinion , it 's not contributing toward the solution of problems around us .
thank you for inviting the public to give their opinion . - malou , the netherlands it sounds like some of it is accurate .
and , some of it is calculated for the response elicited .
i suppose if we really wanted to prevent the information from being leaked , we could .
i mean , how hard is it to arrest the wikileaks leader ? - jane , us in the us we do adhere to our constitutional truth concerning free speech .
however , privacy is also something which is of great and equal importance .
recently , many citizens of germany and elsewhere were concerned about their privacy being invaded by google .
why is it so different concerning documents which were marked " top secret ? "
wikileaks is out of order in this matter , and the media should not fan the flames of disclosing any information its top executives would not want released concerning themselves which could cause further strife and confusion within our global community and harm our already weakened global economy . - darrell , us quote in article from wikileaks regarding angela merkel : " the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " err !
the americans , the british , the french , et al , do n't ?
is that a pink elephant i see floating over my local snowy landscape ? - alan , great britain the publication of confidential information can not make the world safer and more peaceful , but more transparent - yes !
if the leaks are blocked , society will never have a chance to get rid of dominances like endless political hypocrisy , infantilism and lack of respect by politicians towards the citizens of any country .
political arrogance , the sense of impunity and superiority , the petty grudges and personal bias will continue to keep billions of inhabitants of a planet starving .
due to negligence and incompetence , money rarely reaches the ones in need , but is used as a buffer against the opposing politicians , very much like in a childish pillow fight .
this fight , with blows below the belt and bluffing as the main manner of maneuver , once again proves that the world to this day remains a major battleground dominated by the belief that a country can only win at the expense of another , that we are all opponents .
hopefully someday a leak will be able to dig a hole large enough to destroy hypocrisy , for it is hardly the pillar that makes the world more peaceful and more secure .
i doubt it . - petkova , bulgaria wikileaks has done a service to humanity .
the only way for people to develop truly is to know what leaders do as their representatives .
but these leaders keep people in the dark so that they might remain unknowing about important issues that affect their understanding , their beliefs and their lives .

the find has sparked debate on what interests the islamic republic may have in africa 's most populous country of 150 million people . " i think the iranians see the destabilization of nigeria as a chance for the islamization of the whole country , " heinz jocker , a nigeria expert and a member of the eu 's election observation mission -lrb- eueom -rrb- to the country , told deutsche welle .
" they 'd like to see the introduction of a sharia high court across the whole nation . " nigeria 's secret service in october intercepted the shipment of 13 containers filled with rocket launchers , grenades and other explosives and ammunition .
the cargo was thought to be on its way to gambia and had begun its journey from a port in iran .
gambia reacted by severing all diplomatic ties with iran , a strong ally , and demanding all iranian diplomats leave the country within 48 hours . the nigerian government responded to the discovery by alerting the united nations security council under regulations included in un sanctions which bans iran from selling arms . only a few days after iranian businessman azim adhajani and his alleged accomplices faced charges of conspiring to supply illegal weapons , another shipment - this time originating in belgium and travelling through germany - was intercepted in lagos .
this consignment included pistols , ammunition , bulletproof jackets , military boots and eight heavy duty trucks painted in military camouflage and carrying uk insignia .

" but there are n't conclusive signs that this is on the way .
the nigerian authorities can still make this election a success . " however , heinrich bergstresser , a nigeria expert at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- in hamburg , said he believed that the discovery of weapons shipments in nigeria was no cause for alarm in the context of the upcoming elections .

yet glaciers there are melting , irrespective of this year 's controversy over errors in a un climate panel report . during the night of august 6 last year , the small town of leh , the capital of india 's northernmost province ladakh , experienced freak weather conditions . " in that night the weather was unusual .
lightning lit up the sky , thunder shook the mountains , and then it started to rain heavily .
it was n't raining long , but it was the heaviest rainfall i have ever experienced , " karma jamyang a farmer in leh described the events . " suddenly the front door burst open , water and mud poured in .
we panicked .
we wanted to get away , but where ?
right and left , raging water , mud and stones . " he and his family escaped by the skin of their teeth , climbing to the roof of their home .
they lost most of their worldly possessions within a few hours , buried under meters of mud . others were still less fortunate .
the storm claimed almost 200 lives in leh and the surrounding area . climate change to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karma jamyang and his family were lucky to survive the flood the ladakh region is a high-desert , situated 3500 meters above sea level in the rain shadow of the himalayas . it is about as dry here as in the sahara desert .
the heavy rains last august were a freak weather event , which indian meteorologists have linked to global climate change . according to the international research institute for the himalayan hindukhush region in kathmandu , nepal 's climate in the mountain region is warming more than the global average .
last year the french development agency geres published a major study on climate change in the indian himalayas .
geres evaluated the past 35 years of data from the only weather station in ladakh and interviewed hundreds of villagers . " the minimum temperature in winter months in leh has increased by nearly one degree celsius .
the maximum temperature in leh has increased by nearly 0.5 degrees celsius for summer months over the past 35 years , " samten choephel , who works for geres , said . he added that the vast majority of the villagers confirmed these trends .
the survey also indicated that less snow has been falling in winter amid warmer conditions . many farmers observed that their fruit trees were flowering earlier , that migratory birds were staying longer , and that wheat could be harvested at elevations previously only suitable for barley . in the desert climate of ladakh agriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation .
if , however , less snow falls and at the same time the temperatures rise , the glaciers get less snow supply and begin to melt . the people of ladakh are already feeling the consequences . " most of the villagers , i would say about 80 percent , depend on the melt water from glaciers for drinking and cooking , and also to irrigate the fields , " said samten choephel .
" the rapid melting of glaciers has caused water shortages , and that means many farmers have lower yields . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers clear up in the aftermath of the storm in leh .
the glaciers are melting , but how fast ? yet the study and observation of the himalaya 's glaciers is still in its infancy , not least because of the region 's inaccessibility . the indian government only set up a glacier research center last year in the himalayan town of dehra dun . there dwarijka dhobal is kept busy observing climate change in motion . " the mouths of the glaciers through which the melt water flows out are receding by five to twenty meters every year .
the volume is also reducing , the ice gets on average 30 cm thinner each year . " earlier this year , the himalaya 's glaciers became the focus of a controversy surrounding the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
the panel 's fourth assessment report , published in 2007 , contained a paragraph with the false claim that the glaciers would melt by 2035 . although it later emerged that the true figure should have read 2350 , the fact that the glaciers on the highest mountains in the world are melting is not contested , according to dwarijka dhobal . " many millions of people depend on the melt water from the himalayan glaciers to survive , " dhobal added . " outside of the rainy season , especially , in the hot , dry summer months , the area gets up to 35 % of its water from melt water .
therefore , it 's predicted that large parts of south asia will suffer water shortages . " author : rainer hoerig , natalia dannenberg editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .
in translated interview excerpts posted on the website of american broadcaster cnn , putin said if western missile defense installations were located near its borders , russia would have to " ensure its own security . " he said missile threats to europe needed to be tackled jointly .
putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .
putin 's remarks echoed those made on tuesday by russian president dmitry medvedev in a state of the nation address .
medvedev said failure by russia and the west to come to an agreement over a new european missile shield could trigger an arms race .

the treaty is seen as a keystone of better relations between the two countries .
moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .
but russia and nato agreed in lisbon this month to look into ways in which they could cooperate on a new continental shield .
the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

his remarks echo earlier comments by prime minister dmitry medvedev . russian prime minister vladimir putin has warned that his country will deploy nuclear weapons if it is excluded from a western missile shield in europe .
in translated interview excerpts posted on the website of american broadcaster cnn , putin said if western missile defense installations were located near its borders , russia would have to " ensure its own security . " he said missile threats to europe needed to be tackled jointly .
putin said russia would " put in place new strike forces " and build up " new missile , new nuclear technologies . "
he denied , however , that russia was threatening the west .
putin 's remarks echoed those made on tuesday by russian president dmitry medvedev in a state of the nation address .
medvedev said failure by russia and the west to come to an agreement over a new european missile shield could trigger an arms race .
ratification uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia already has a considerable missile arsenal the warnings from the kremlin come amid uncertainty about whether the us senate will ratify start , a new strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty signed by us president barack obama and medvedev in april .
the treaty is seen as a keystone of better relations between the two countries .
moscow has resisted the idea of a missile shield for years , feeling it to be a threat .
but russia and nato agreed in lisbon this month to look into ways in which they could cooperate on a new continental shield .
the united states has always insisted that the shield is meant to ward off the missile threat from countries such as iran and north korea .
it denies that the system is or would be in any way directed at russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

in the kazakh capital , astana , chancellor angela merkel said all member states must do more to promote human rights . world leaders collectively called for a stronger organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- on wednesday , as the body 's first summit since 1999 got underway .
chancellor angela merkel said the 56-member group must first ensure peace and freedom within its borders .
" there 's still a lot of work to do .
conflicts in this region must be successfully solved , now , " merkel told delegates in the kazakh capital , astana .
merkel said the organization still had some way to go before becoming a " cooperative security forum on the basis of democracy and freedom . "
" human rights guarantees , such as democracy and freedom of expression and media , must be fully implemented in all -lrb- osce -rrb- member states , " merkel said , in what may have been a veiled reference to kazakhstan , the host country , among others .
the first ex-soviet republic to hold the chairmanship of the organization , kazakhstan itself does not meet the organization 's standards on freedom of press and assembly .
reporters without borders on wednesday said kazakhstan was an unsuitable choice to host the osce 's first summit of the 21st century .
" we have created a democracy in a part of the world where it never existed before , " kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev said in his opening address , seeking to answer his critics .
" stability in kazakhstan , first and foremost , means economic growth .
we developed the economy first in order that poverty did not humiliate our young democracy . "
afghanistan , regional conflicts on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- said confidence in the osce was gradually being restored thirty-eight heads of state and other top leaders from around the world have traveled to astana for the two-day meeting , amid tight security .
they are seeking to strengthen the osce 's chairmanship and to consider taking on a greater role in afghanistan , as fellow international organizations call for help .
" the united nations would welcome greater osce involvement in supporting afghan national programs and priorities , " said un secretary general ban ki-moon .
conflicts left over from the soviet era , including the nagorno-karabakh dispute between armenia and azerbaijan , moldova 's rebel region of transdniestria and georgia 's separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , were also set to feature in the discussions .
need for modernization earlier on wednesday , us secretary of state hillary clinton urged world leaders to agree on a " forward-looking framework for action " to prevent conflicts , calling on them to back the osce 's institutions and missions " with political will . "
" regional crises and transnational dangers threaten our people .
democracies are under pressure , and protracted conflicts remain dangerously unresolved , " clinton said .
she was echoed by russian president dimitry medvedev , who said the organization had begun to " lose its potential , " and called for modernization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce posters are everywhere in astana however , clinton and medvedev had their differences over the osce 's role in georgia .
clinton implicitly criticized moscow by calling for the reestablishment of an osce mission in georgia .
in 2009 , russia vetoed the continuation of the mission after the 2008 war with georgia over its breakaway region of south ossetia .
in his remarks , medvedev laid the blame on georgia for the conflict over south ossetia , accusing it of improper use of force .
reduced flexibility as world leaders seek to find common ground at the summit , osce secretary general marc perrin de brichambaut called for a strong final statement .
he , too , criticized the organization 's lack of real clout , saying that a lack of confidence between member states had reduced its flexibility in responding to crises and new threats .
the organization was set up during the cold war as a forum for dialogue between communist states and the west .
it 's made up of european and central asian countries as well as the us and canada .
the last osce summit took place in istanbul in 1999 .

he was trying to plug an information leak .
his bosses were let off the hook for lack of evidence . a former deutsche telekom security manager has been given a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for his role in using telephone records to scrutinize executives , journalists and trade unionists from 2005 to 2006 .
identified as klaus t. , the 60-year-old admitted to having collected telephone data on 40 people .
he was trying to identify a leak in the company 's organizational structure after media reports surfaced about substantial layoff plans .
prosecutor ulrich kleuser described his actions as " an extreme attack on the freedom of the press and of information . "
klaus t. , who spent most of his life working for deutsche telekom , was accused of seven counts of illegal data use under the federal privacy act , along with fraud and embezzlement .
he had charged a third-party security company with the task of searching for patterns in the secretly collected telephone data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus zumwinkel beat the privacy violation charge , but was convicted of tax evasion similar cases against deutsche telekom 's former ceo , kai-uwe ricke , and supervisory board chief klaus zumwinkel were dropped in june for lack of evidence .
though zumwinkel denied wrongdoing , journalists called his innocence into question at the time .
individual punishment although klaus t. acted independently and said he " deeply regretted " the " very big mistake , which he certainly would n't do again , " he also said his superiors " never questioned " his actions .
the sentence " certainly sends a signal , which partially is surprising to me , " oliver goenner , a bonn-area lawyer specializing in data protection , told deutsche welle .
the sentence is fairly harsh when one takes into account that in germany violation of the data protection act carries a maximum two-year sentence and violation of the telecommunications act carries a maximum of five years , goenner said .
one likely reason for the harsh sentence was that klaus t. was also accused of fraud and embezzlement .
however , in february three google executives were held responsible in italy for violating the privacy of a disabled boy who could be seen on youtube receiving a beating .
the two sentences show that attitudes towards privacy violations are changing , goenner said .
" the significant signal of this sentence is that data protection is no longer a problem which can be solved financially - that one can be held personally responsible and do jail time for violations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 01.12.2010 india proposes compromise on climate stumbling block großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates say china should be more accountable for its co2 emissions rich and poor countries are divided over several issues in cancun , including how to disburse climate finances and how to account for actions taken .
however , india appears to be making some concessions . as the un climate talks in cancun enter their third day , climate negotiators have struggled to reach agreement over proposals that would abolish a two-decade divide between rich and poor on scrutiny of greenhouse gas emissions .
a main point of controversy in cancun is how far rich and poor countries report their pledges and whether these should be subject to international scrutiny .
developed countries say fast-growing emerging economies like china , which has become the world 's top carbon emitter , have to do far more to prove their emissions reductions .
" for china , there needs to be much tighter rules for measurement , reporting and verification compared to a small poor country , " artur runge-metzger , a senior european union negotiator , said .
india is proposing that all major economies , developed and developing , would report their emissions , while the rich would also detail climate aid .
" it 's an offer which could solve a lot , " said greenpeace 's siddharth pathak of the indian proposal .
major concession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladesh is constantly threatened by the effects of climate change india 's proposal marks a big concession by a major emerging economy and would dilute differences between rich and poor .
according to current rules , only 40 developed nations are required to report their emissions annually .
many poor nations oppose changing a 1992 un convention that obliges the rich , who are mostly responsible for climate change , to take the lead in dealing with the problem .
cancun will also try to seek agreement on a " green fund " to channel aid to the poor .
the so-called copenhagen accord promised immediate financial aid to the tune of 30 billion dollars for countries most affected by climate change in the years 2010 to 2012 .
on wednesday , the government in bangladesh called on this funding to be made available quickly .
" it must be disbursed quickly among vulnerable nations by 2012 , " environment minister hasan mahmud said .
" the number of storms , floods , tidal surges and droughts hitting bangladesh has gone up in the past 100 years .
it has worsened poverty . "
the low-lying country is vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of global warming with natural disasters killing nearly 200,000 people in the last 30 years , mahmud told reporters in dhaka .
what 's stalling the release of funds is a lack of agreement and transparency .
it remains unclear how much of the money is new , and how much is to be recycled out of existing development aid budgets .
if the negotiations in cancun do n't bring transparency to this area , there 's less chance that the parties will agree on climate funds for the period after 2020 .
from then on , 100 billion us dollars will be spent each year on climate action in developing countries - both on adaptation and co2-reduction measures .
middlemen bildunterschrift : ngos like oxfam are desperate to reach an agreement in cancun it is also unclear who will manage the money .
many industrial countries - notably the us - want the world bank and the international monetary fund to administer it .
but many developing countries do n't have a very good experience of theses two un institutions .
" it is the small developing countries , which have indeed felt the consequences of climate change most strongly , are of course against financial institutions like the world bank also funding climate aid , because they have no say there , " said greenpeace climate expert martin kaiser .
another sticking point is whether the climate funds should be loans or grants .
the european union said on tuesday that it would honor it 's copenhagen pledge by mobilizing 2.2 billion euros -lrb- 2.9 billion dollars -rrb- out of the eu 's 7.2-billion-euro promise of " fast-start " financing , aid for climate projects in poor countries by 2012 .
but half of the eu 's funding would involve loans instead of grants to the poor , a move quickly criticized by environmentalists , who say loans were the wrong tool for industrialized societies to help poorer countries that have not caused global warming but are feeling its effects .
" that would be the same as if i take my car and i drive it into your car , and then i offer you a loan to repair the damage , " said tove ryding of greenpeace .
the eu 's chief negotiator in cancun , artur runge-metzger , defended the use of loans as helpful for many clean energy projects that had high start-up costs but would actually save money over time .
runge-metzger said the loans would only go to countries that were not highly indebted already , thereby making sure that borrowers could pay the money back , without pushing debt-ridden governments further into trouble .
while some of the repaid loans would go back into other climate projects , he acknowledged some of the money could also flow back to cash-strapped eu budgets .
if representatives of the 194 countries do not succeed , at least to agree on key points , there 's a risk that the negotiations may fail completely , and so the credibility of the whole un process is at stake .
time is also running out for the kyoto protocol , whose first commitment period expires at the end of 2012 .
it is still the only binding agreement that regulates co2 emissions in the industrial nations which signed it .
neither the us nor china is bound by the kyoto protocol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 01.12.2010 eu pushes for lower phone , internet costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes warned national telecom regulators neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , warns the industry of increased pressure in 2011 .
national telecom regulators , as in italy , have not kept up the pressure on former state monopolies . in a speech in brussels on tuesday , the european union 's telecom commissioner warned of new eu-level pressure on member states that continue to allow former state telephone monopolies to charge high fees for phone and internet costs .
the european commission has said that these additional charges range from five euros -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- extra per month , as is the case in poland , to as much as 18 euros a month in ireland .
the move , known in the industry as local-loop unbundling , requires local telephone providers to be able to buy phone and internet access from former state monopolies , like france telecom or deutsche telekom , at cost .
this then creates more competition at the retail level .
a new eu law gives neelie kroes , the eu 's telecom commissioner , the power to open high-level investigations into national telecom regulators who themselves are not cracking down within their own country .
" equal access to information is another key principle of non-discrimination , " she said in the speech .
" where the dominant operator shares between its wholesale and retail arms commercially sensitive information about the network , but withholds it from access seekers , this could grant the retail arm of the dominant operator an anti-competitive advantage . "
the speech was given just a month after the european commission said that it supported plans by the italian telecom industry regulator , known as autorita per le garanzie nelle comunicazioni , or agcom , to let telecom italia raise its wholesale rates by 24 percent over the next two years .
agcom later revised that figure in november to a maximum of 9.4 percent following an october 21 letter from kroes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a former monopoly , france telecom may face increased pressure from brussels industry will not act on its own , expert says telecom observers say that kroes ' pressure is long overdue .
" the fact that this is necessary shows the profound weakness and ineffectiveness of numerous european national telecoms regulatory authorities , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights agency , a non-profit advocacy group in brussels , in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" in the same speech , the commissioner urged ' national regulators not to hesitate to take action against any company ' that was engaged in discriminatory behavior .
the regulators do hesitate and this is one of the weakest links in the chain of defense of an open , democratic neutral internet . "
in a related speech last thursday in paris , kroes also called for greater cloud computing security and consumer protection , including the right to permanently remove personal data from the internet - a measure that is also being championed by her predecessor , viviane reding , who is now the eu 's justice commissioner .
" having clear and ' cloud-friendly ' rules can only help ict -lsb- … -rsb- to know exactly what is allowed and what is not , " kroes said , adding that this could lead to simplification , for example in registration forms .
kroes emphasized that the eu commission encourages " self-regulatory initiatives , such as codes of conduct or codes of practice like the ' binding corporate rules ' for international data transfers .
that is how they can effectively both protect and serve their customers . "

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said it was " a particularly serious invasion of privacy rights " when sites " publish data that has been aggregated with commercial interests in mind " and which " yield a comprehensive personality of travel profile . "
" there are limits , and that limit is the protection of personal information and human dignity , " he said .
but he added that he was not interested in restricting the opportunities the internet made possible .

the new law , if passed , would amend the current federal privacy act and create a central online repository for geo-spatial and geo-location information .
self-regulation also on wednesday , german tech trade group bitkom submitted its proposal on industry self-regulation with the group 's president , august-wilhelm scheer , formally presenting a codex on data protection to de maiziere in berlin . the move comes just two months after de maiziere called on tech companies doing business in germany to draw up such a code .
bitkom represents more than 1,350 companies in germany , including major players like google , microsoft , nokia , deutsche telekom , deutsche post and others .
among its suggestions , bitkom offered to set up a single website where german residents could access what geo-data is made available about them , and what rights they have to correct or request its deletion .
users could also submit similar requests by postal mail , or call a government-run hotline to get questions answered .
" with this kind of self-regulation , the sector will offer consumers maximum transparency and make it easy to opt out , " scheer said .
" the codex goes far beyond the current legal regulations . "
bildunterschrift : street view caused an uproar in germany , a country sensitive about privacy issues in addition , companies would be required to give at least one month 's notice before photographing locations by listing their plans on their own websites as well as on the centralized one .
that would require sites like google street view to provide much more advance notification than they do now .
sites complying with the rules would feature a logo on their pages .
the bill also indicates that there will be checks and penalties , although it does not yet specify what those would be .
not tough enough but data protection commissioners harshly criticized the draft law , especially the self-regulation aspect .
they said the rules did not go far enough , nor did they have teeth .
" companies that do n't sign up to self-regulate wo n't be bound , and there wo n't be any independent privacy watchdog to police it , " said johannes caspar , a commissioner from the federal state of hamburg .
while the impetus for the new data protection discussion was google street view 's launch in germany , de maiziere said on wednesday he though facial recognition software , for example on mobile phone cameras , that could identify people by name was a more serious threat to privacy than the google 's service offering detailed photographs of city streets .

the new rules were drafted after an outcry over google street view . germany 's interior minister on wednesday unveiled a draft law to tighten rules on internet privacy , sparked by the uproar this summer over the google street view mapping service .
the draft is a combination of self-regulation by google and other companies , and new rules that would make it illegal to gather certain kinds of personal information .

ethnic tensions have run high in central asia , and there 's also the small issue of wikileaks . the gathering of the 56 member states has been overshadowed by the release of confidential cables by american diplomats , many of which characterize foreign leaders in decidedly unflattering terms .
they were made public by the website wikileaks late last week .
" obviously this is a matter of great concern because we do n't want anyone in any of the countries that could be affected by these alleged leaks to have any doubts about our intentions and about our commitments , " us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters before leaving for astana on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton may have to soothe some hurt feelings in astana among those who were criticized by us diplomats were kazakh elites , who were described as leading overly lavish lifestyles and , in at least one case , having an excessive fondness for alcoholic beverages .
and that 's not been the only criticism of leaders from the host country , as many of the world 's most powerful nations sit down to discuss issues ranging from terrorism , drug trafficking and the drawn-out conflicts in central asia and afghanistan .
controversial hosts along with criticism of kazakhstan 's less-than-stellar human-rights record , experts are divided as to whether the oil-rich nation plays a positive role in a region ridden with ethnic and economic conflict .
in june of this year , for example , clashes between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan left around 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has not been a good year for peace in central asia " we have conflicts here between uzbeks and kyrgyz , between kyrgyz and tajiks and between tajiks and uzbeks , " regional expert natalia kharitonova , from the russian state university for the humanities , told deutsche welle .
" ethnic tensions in kazakhstan are less grave because of the higher standard of living . "
but others say kazakhstan 's relative affluence is in itself a source of regional instability " social inequalities between the nations of central asia bring with them great potential for conflict among the ethnic peoples of central asia , " said michael laubsch , the director of the eurasian transition group .
the very fact that the summit is being held in astana is designed to underscore the claims of kazakhstan and its president , nursultan nazarbayev , to major-player status .
" first and foremost , the osce summit is a foreign policy advertisement project and president nazarbayev 's personal public relations project , " kazakh political analyst dosym satpayev told the reuters news agency .
" he is very ambitious and is keen to position himself not as a regional but , rather , a world leader . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazarbayev -lrb- center -rrb- hopes to lift his international profile if nazarbayev could broker a breakthrough on one of the major issues under discussion , for instance the conflict between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagorny-karabakh region , it would certainly be a publicity coup .
but that wo n't be easy , especially as the usefulness of the osce itself is coming under scrutiny .
past its prime ?
the organization that became the osce was founded in 1975 as a non-binding pact intended to further stability throughout the northern hemisphere and to serve as a forum for dialogue between east and west during the cold war .
its high point came in the mid- and late-1990s , when it played a major role in bringing the balkan wars to an end .
but the osce 's budget and influence has declined in the new millennium , and critics say the organization 's structure is too cumbersome to prevent and resolve conflicts like those in central asia this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce oversaw the elections that brought a measure of peace to the balkans " during and immediately following the violent uprising in kyrgyzstan , it was unable to react quickly , stop the massacre and bring the situation under control , " said laubsch .
but the osce has also received some important public backing .
russia , which has often criticized what it sees as a pro-western bias within the organization , has indicated it thinks the osce does indeed have a future .
" the osce 's potential has not been exhausted , " kremlin foreign policy advisor sergei prikhodko told reporters in advance of the summit .
at an informal osce summit this summer , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov took much the same line .
" our organization is capable of responding to crises , " lavrov told reporters last july .
russia was characterized in one of the leaked cables as " an oligarchy run by the security services . "
lavrov played down the importance of the embarrassing memos ahead of the summit , calling them an " amusing read . "
it remains to be seen , however , how many of the leaders can put hurt feelings behind them as they strive to define a new role for the osce in the 21st century - and perhaps make progress on the odd political crisis or two .

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .

katharina weiss ' book " generation geil " -lrb- " generation cool " -rrb- aims to paint an accurate picture of what makes today 's young germans tick . " generation porno , " facebook-addicts , flatrate-drinkers - today 's young people in germany have garnered quite a few unflattering labels .
katharina weiss , a 16-year-old from a small village in bavaria , was fed up with being put in a box and went out to find out - and show the rest of germany - what her peers are really like . from sex , drugs and alcohol to religion , security and future plans , weiss proves that she and her generation ca n't be put in a box . deutsche welle : what was the concept of your new book " generation geil " ? katharina weiss : for the book i interviewed 20 young people from all over germany and asked them for their opinions about topics such as politics , love , religion , school , parents , sex , moral values and future opportunities .
there are really so few media platforms around today for young people to voice an opinion and for that reason an increasing number of adults are writing about young people .
i wanted to change that . the word " geil " can be translated into english as either " cool " or " horny . "
which meaning did you intend ? definitely cool .
i did n't mean horny at all ! from all the portraits of young people you featured in your book , do you have a favorite ? this guy called fabian was a real interview highlight for me .
he was a really charismatic personality and came out with the funniest stories with such an appealing streak of nihilism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still at school , katharina has no definite career plans yet but journalism could be an option the book has caused quite a splash for its frank opinions about school , sex and drugs .
did you set out to write something controversial ? i just wanted to present different lives and compose authentic portraits of people .
so far the feedback from people my age who have read the book has been very encouraging . was it easy to find a publisher ? actually , yes .
i really had a lot of luck there and everything happened insanely fast .
i saw an author on mtvhome.de and she had written a similar non-fiction portrait type book and i really liked this idea .
all i did was send the synopsis for my book to her publisher , shwartzkopf & schwartzkopf , and the rest was history . at 16 , you 're already a published author .
what are your career plans ? i still do n't have any definite ideas yet but obviously something like journalism interests me .
to be able to meet new people and have insight into their lives and stories is something which i find very appealing . what would be your advice for other young people who want to write a book ? i 'm not sure i am the right person to ask for advice to be honest .
i just had a lot of luck !
but in general , all i can say is : give it a try .
a year ago , i would never have imagined that i would publish a book . when you 're not making waves in the world of literature what do you like to get up to ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out now from schwartzkopf & schwartzkopf i like photography a lot and especially like taking party pictures in clubs .
i 'm also a big film fan .
in addition i 'm responsible for putting together the youth page of our local newspaper . christmas is just around the corner : what would you like to find in your stocking on christmas morning ? well , here in bavaria we get a visit from the " christkind " -lsb- christ child -rsb- and i 'd be over the moon if he brought me tickets for next year 's rock am ring music festival ! interview : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cold conditions have already claimed at least nine lives and caused considerable disruption to travel . freezing temperatures and snow have affected much of europe , claiming several lives and disrupting travel .
for much of germany it has been the coldest december 1 in decades .
thermometers in berlin clocked minus 10.9 degrees celsius -lrb- 12.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- overnight , marking the coldest start to december in almost 80 years , while the most populous - and usually one of the most temperate - of germany 's states , north-rhine westphalia , experienced its chilliest december 1 since 1973 .
germany 's largest airport , in frankfurt , reported that very few flights were disrupted by the weather , after the icy temperatures had forced the major hub to cancel almost 300 take-offs and landings on tuesday .
roughly 60 flights were cancelled wednesday , but a spokesman for the airport said this was largely a spillover from the previous day 's chaos .
munich airport , however , was forced to cancel some 250 flights on wednesday afternoon .
the roads in germany remained largely clear , considering the conditions , although shops and markets around the country were beginning to complain of missing or late stock deliveries as truck drivers battled against the elements .
deadly cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without shelter , the weather is a life-threatening matter polish police said at least eight men had frozen to death since monday in poland , where temperatures had fallen to around minus 20 degrees celsius in many places .
they said the men were aged between 33 and 72 and had been drinking alcohol .
a pensioner in austria also died overnight in the northern town of freistadt .
public broadcaster orf reported that the man fell over while walking home from a funeral , lost consciousness and was not found for several hours , by which time he had frozen to death .
officials in vienna were also forced to close the motorway ring road after several trucks ground to a halt .
snow forced airports to close at gatwick airport near london , edinburgh airport in scotland and geneva airport in switzerland .
in southern england , motor traffic was disrupted , with 400 trucks stranded on one iced-over motorway .
rail links were cut , forcing many commuters to remain home .
hundreds of schools were also closed .
meanwhile eurostar , which operates passenger rail service between england and mainland europe , announced that close to half of its trains would be cancelled on thursday and advised passengers to postpone nonessential trips .
only the southern extremes of mainland europe escaped the frost , with spain and southern italy enjoying milder temperatures ; but both those countries were still struggling with unseasonably heavy rainfall .
rome 's river tiber , swelled by days of heavy rains , was close to overflowing in some areas on wednesday afternoon .
predominantly sub-zero temperatures and widespread snowfall are predicted to persist across much of mainland europe until at least the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 01.12.2010 struggle to find an aids vaccine continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for an aids vaccine continues there has been a lot of hopeful progress made in the area of hiv vaccine research over the years , but many a setback as well .
one reason for this is that there are many different strains of hiv . since hiv , the virus that causes aids , was discovered in 1982 , scientists around the world have been trying to create a vaccine against it .
but 28 years later after its discovery , and 22 years after the first world aids day on december 1 , 1988 , the world is still waiting for the big breakthrough .
nevertheless , scientists have n't given up yet .
they know that a well tolerated , effective vaccine could effectively stop the worldwide spread of aids .
developing an aids vaccine is an ambitious undertaking .
there have been signs of promise , but setbacks as well , largely due to the changing nature of the virus .
the fact is , there is no single strain of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- , but many viruses , all of them slightly different .
" the virus is constantly changing , altering its structure , its genetic composition .
that makes it harder for the immune system to fight , " said gerd faetkenheuer , a professor at the university clinic in cologne , in an interview with deutsche welle .
when a person is infected with hiv , his or her immune system develops antibodies that fight the virus , but he or she is unable to stop it from spreading .
simulated antibodies created in the lab " everyone who is infected , every patient , has antibodies .
but these antibodies do n't protect against the virus - as a rule , they just indicate it , " faetkenheuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoms are still one of the best methods in aids prevention researchers have been able to create simulated antibodies in the lab that are better than natural ones .
they can protect people from numerous hiv strains and can even stop the virus from entering and infecting cells .
but it 's not clear whether these molecules will be able to function outside of the lab .
a further approach to vaccine research aims to teach the immune system what hiv-infected cells look like , so that the body can recognize the cells and get rid of them .
according to faetkenheuer , this kind of vaccine would n't be able to prevent infection , but could at least teach the body how to control it .
" we need immune cells that can recognize and kill the virus , " he said .
" a major problem in hiv infection is that the virus attacks the immune cells as well .
you can even say that it attacks the most important cells of the immune system - the helper cells .
they control the immuno-response . "
the thai exception none of the possible vaccines that have been tested on people so far have proved effective - with one exception .
in thailand , a combined vaccine was effective to a certain level .
its double aim was to stimulate antibody production while teaching the immune system to recognize infected cells .
in a test group , those vaccinated showed 31 percent fewer incidents of infection .
this is the first small success after a series of setbacks .
yet there is one major problem : to this day , researchers can not explain how the vaccine worked , and they are n't sure whether or not the results can be trusted .
" -lsb- 31 percent -rsb- is a very slight difference , which also can be affected by external factors , " faetkenheuer said .
" so we ca n't be sure if it was a real result , or if external factors that we have n't yet identified played a role . "
looking for answers in healthy populations researchers hope that a new , detailed analysis of the thai experiment - already underway - will bring an answer to this question .
results are expected in around two years .
so what does a vaccine need to be able to do in order to protect someone from contracting hiv ?
dr. bruce walker , an aids expert at boston university , is looking for the answer .
he is testing carriers of the hiv virus who have the unusual ability to control the virus to the point where it almost does n't replicate at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine tested in thailand has shown promise ; further studies are being done walker has discovered genetic material in these subjects that does n't exist in other hiv patients .
" the challenge is now for us to reach the point that we understand the mechanism and find out how to really control the virus , " he said .
but there is likely to be a long road before that point is reached .
there may never be a 100 percent reliable vaccine against hiv - but even a vaccine with a 50 or 60 percent protective effect could help to slow the spread of the virus , experts say .
multifaceted strategy for fighting the disease a complete disease-fighting strategy would n't rely entirely on the vaccine .
other techniques include : condoms , male circumcision , and medication .
because as it turns out , hiv-infected patients who are medically treated are less infectious , faetkenheuer said . " at present , the most successful tool we have is n't vaccination , it is treatment , " faetkenheuer said .
" when people are treated , it means that fewer people will be infected . "
the problem with that , however , is that even in wealthy europe , about half of the people who are hiv positive do n't know it .
" if they do n't do an aids test , they can infect other people without even wanting to , " said jens lundgren , a professor at the university of copenhagen . " they do n't know that they are a risk for their partner , and a risk for society . "
as ever , taking a simple aids test is one method for proving an existing infection - and for getting early treatment .
and it is still the surest way to know whether or not you could spread the virus to other people .
