they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .

he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .

" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.03.2010 e-learning 's potential is hampered by misuse , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you can even " drink " beer with mobile apps , but they 're not just for entertainment the world of ' e-learning ' is growing more pervasive every day .
but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

dw-world.de critics are wary of britain 's move to close digital gap britain is taking drastic action to help close the digital divide between rich and poor in the country , giving free laptops and internet access to people who qualify .
but the scheme has also come under fire .

but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .
the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces acts as an advocate for the armed forces and reports to the parliament on the situation within the military. hf / afp / epd / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ali charaf damache , a 44-year-old from algeria , was charged with sending a threatening text message .
abdul salam monsour khalil al-jahani , 32 , from libya , was charged with failing to show correct identity papers .
the charges , handed down by courts in dublin and waterford on monday , follow the release of five others arrested at the same time as damache and al-jahani .
two were algerian , one palestinian , one croatian and one american .
us news reports identified the american as 31-year-old islam convert jamie paulin ramirez .
ramirez 's mother and stepfather told reuters that damache and their daughter had recently married .
they also said they believe she was recruited to join the plot by colleen larose , another american convert who has been charged with recruiting people to carry out terrorist plots over the internet .
us prosecutors said larose , who used the online alias " jihad jane , " had pledged to carry out the murder of an unnamed swedish resident .
larose was arrested last fall .
artist lars vilks ' drawing appeared in a swedish newspaper in 2007 to illustrate an editorial about freedom of expression .
but the depiction attracted controversy and threats that mirrored those which followed a danish newspaper 's publication of several cartoons of muhammad , including one drawn so that the prophet 's turban resembled a bomb .
an iraqi group linked to al qaeda had offered a $ 100,000 reward for vilks ' murder .
vilks told reuters last wednesday that he had received further death threats in internet messages since the arrests were announced last week. svs / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.03.2010 e-learning 's potential is hampered by misuse , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you can even " drink " beer with mobile apps , but they 're not just for entertainment the world of ' e-learning ' is growing more pervasive every day .
but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : middle east peace process israel , palestinians lack alternatives to faltering two-state solution israel 's reputation in tatters as eu , world powers review relations israel eases blockade of gaza strip amid diplomatic flap with germany us envoy pushes for progress as israel and palestinians stall on peace middle east -pipe- 16.03.2010 united in disagreement : the peace process is dead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't agree on much but both fatah and hamas say the peace process with israel is dead on its feet a senior palestinian negotiator from fatah has given the clearest indication yet that peace negotiations are doomed to fail with the current israeli government .
it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .
on tuesday , the german bishops ' conference announced that a telephone hotline , for both victims and perpetrators , would be launched at the end of march. gb / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .
on tuesday , the german bishops ' conference announced that a telephone hotline , for both victims and perpetrators , would be launched at the end of march. gb / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.03.2010 e-learning 's potential is hampered by misuse , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you can even " drink " beer with mobile apps , but they 're not just for entertainment the world of ' e-learning ' is growing more pervasive every day .
but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

dw-world.de critics are wary of britain 's move to close digital gap britain is taking drastic action to help close the digital divide between rich and poor in the country , giving free laptops and internet access to people who qualify .
but the scheme has also come under fire .
-lrb- 19.02.2010 -rrb- berlin students are selling old chairs to finance projects desperate for more financial resources , student activists at berlin 's humboldt university are currently turning old auditorium chairs into money by selling individual seats to alumni .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .
the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces acts as an advocate for the armed forces and reports to the parliament on the situation within the military. hf / afp / epd / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

he is the first german bank manager to face trial in connection with the banking crisis . " i have reached the conclusion that i am not to blame in a legal sense , " stefan ortseifen , 59 , told the duesseldorf court at the outset of the trial on tuesday . more than two and a half years after the ikb -lrb- deutsche industrie bank -rrb- bank stood at the brink of collapse , ortseifen is charged with breach of trust and manipulating share prices in a trial expected to run until the end of may . at the center of the charges is an ikb press release dated july 20th , 2007 , which portrayed the economic impact the financial crisis had on the bank in an overly positive way , the prosecution said .
" in the press release , mr. ortseifen is believed to have made misleading allegations , " prosecutor nils bussee said .
" we believe that his statements led to a temporary increase of ikb 's share prices . " but ortseifen told the court that the contents of the press release wre correct at the time it was issued .
the former ikb head said that deutsche bank triggered the crisis a week later when it froze its line of credit for the lender .
risk was foreseeable bussee said the press statement did not mention a $ 171 million -lrb- 124 million euros -rrb- risk that was already foreseeable , but gave the impression that the impact the us subprime crisis had on the bank was much less severe .
ulrich hartmann , a former head of ikb 's board of directors , said the crisis for the bank was not foreseeable .
" we did not stand a chance to recognize the risks and avert the threat to the bank , " he said .
" risk management systems all over the world failed , and supervisory boards did not notice . "
just days later , the real extent of the bank 's exposure to the crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the us became evident . a ten-billion euro cash injection from the german government and private banks saved the bank from insolvency . a year later , ikb was sold to lone star , a us-based investment fund .
ortseifen is also charged with an unauthorized lavish renovation of the bank-owned villa he lives in .
the bank has taken action for repossession , but ortseifen has so far refused to move out. db / ap / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is the first german bank manager to face trial in connection with the banking crisis . " i have reached the conclusion that i am not to blame in a legal sense , " stefan ortseifen , 59 , told the duesseldorf court at the outset of the trial on tuesday . more than two and a half years after the ikb -lrb- deutsche industrie bank -rrb- bank stood at the brink of collapse , ortseifen is charged with breach of trust and manipulating share prices in a trial expected to run until the end of may . at the center of the charges is an ikb press release dated july 20th , 2007 , which portrayed the economic impact the financial crisis had on the bank in an overly positive way , the prosecution said .
" in the press release , mr. ortseifen is believed to have made misleading allegations , " prosecutor nils bussee said .
" we believe that his statements led to a temporary increase of ikb 's share prices . " but ortseifen told the court that the contents of the press release wre correct at the time it was issued .
the former ikb head said that deutsche bank triggered the crisis a week later when it froze its line of credit for the lender .
risk was foreseeable bussee said the press statement did not mention a $ 171 million -lrb- 124 million euros -rrb- risk that was already foreseeable , but gave the impression that the impact the us subprime crisis had on the bank was much less severe .
ulrich hartmann , a former head of ikb 's board of directors , said the crisis for the bank was not foreseeable .
" we did not stand a chance to recognize the risks and avert the threat to the bank , " he said .
" risk management systems all over the world failed , and supervisory boards did not notice . "
just days later , the real extent of the bank 's exposure to the crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the us became evident . a ten-billion euro cash injection from the german government and private banks saved the bank from insolvency . a year later , ikb was sold to lone star , a us-based investment fund .
ortseifen is also charged with an unauthorized lavish renovation of the bank-owned villa he lives in .
the bank has taken action for repossession , but ortseifen has so far refused to move out. db / ap / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”

german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .

dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .

peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .

robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .

the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "

" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

he is the first german bank manager to face trial in connection with the banking crisis . " i have reached the conclusion that i am not to blame in a legal sense , " stefan ortseifen , 59 , told the duesseldorf court at the outset of the trial on tuesday . more than two and a half years after the ikb -lrb- deutsche industrie bank -rrb- bank stood at the brink of collapse , ortseifen is charged with breach of trust and manipulating share prices in a trial expected to run until the end of may . at the center of the charges is an ikb press release dated july 20th , 2007 , which portrayed the economic impact the financial crisis had on the bank in an overly positive way , the prosecution said .
" in the press release , mr. ortseifen is believed to have made misleading allegations , " prosecutor nils bussee said .
" we believe that his statements led to a temporary increase of ikb 's share prices . " but ortseifen told the court that the contents of the press release wre correct at the time it was issued .
the former ikb head said that deutsche bank triggered the crisis a week later when it froze its line of credit for the lender .
risk was foreseeable bussee said the press statement did not mention a $ 171 million -lrb- 124 million euros -rrb- risk that was already foreseeable , but gave the impression that the impact the us subprime crisis had on the bank was much less severe .
ulrich hartmann , a former head of ikb 's board of directors , said the crisis for the bank was not foreseeable .
" we did not stand a chance to recognize the risks and avert the threat to the bank , " he said .
" risk management systems all over the world failed , and supervisory boards did not notice . "

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .

" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .

" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

he is the first german bank manager to face trial in connection with the banking crisis . " i have reached the conclusion that i am not to blame in a legal sense , " stefan ortseifen , 59 , told the duesseldorf court at the outset of the trial on tuesday . more than two and a half years after the ikb -lrb- deutsche industrie bank -rrb- bank stood at the brink of collapse , ortseifen is charged with breach of trust and manipulating share prices in a trial expected to run until the end of may . at the center of the charges is an ikb press release dated july 20th , 2007 , which portrayed the economic impact the financial crisis had on the bank in an overly positive way , the prosecution said .

he is the first german bank manager to face trial in connection with the banking crisis . " i have reached the conclusion that i am not to blame in a legal sense , " stefan ortseifen , 59 , told the duesseldorf court at the outset of the trial on tuesday . more than two and a half years after the ikb -lrb- deutsche industrie bank -rrb- bank stood at the brink of collapse , ortseifen is charged with breach of trust and manipulating share prices in a trial expected to run until the end of may . at the center of the charges is an ikb press release dated july 20th , 2007 , which portrayed the economic impact the financial crisis had on the bank in an overly positive way , the prosecution said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.03.2010 e-learning 's potential is hampered by misuse , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you can even " drink " beer with mobile apps , but they 're not just for entertainment the world of ' e-learning ' is growing more pervasive every day .
but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : middle east peace process israel , palestinians lack alternatives to faltering two-state solution israel 's reputation in tatters as eu , world powers review relations israel eases blockade of gaza strip amid diplomatic flap with germany us envoy pushes for progress as israel and palestinians stall on peace middle east -pipe- 16.03.2010 united in disagreement : the peace process is dead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do n't agree on much but both fatah and hamas say the peace process with israel is dead on its feet a senior palestinian negotiator from fatah has given the clearest indication yet that peace negotiations are doomed to fail with the current israeli government .
it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .

when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 16.03.2010 german bishops call for end to celibacy mandate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some catholics say priests should be allowed to marry too catholic officials deny a direct connection between child sexual abuse by priests and the church 's strict celibacy policy .
but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

ali charaf damache , a 44-year-old from algeria , was charged with sending a threatening text message .
abdul salam monsour khalil al-jahani , 32 , from libya , was charged with failing to show correct identity papers .
the charges , handed down by courts in dublin and waterford on monday , follow the release of five others arrested at the same time as damache and al-jahani .
two were algerian , one palestinian , one croatian and one american .
us news reports identified the american as 31-year-old islam convert jamie paulin ramirez .
ramirez 's mother and stepfather told reuters that damache and their daughter had recently married .
they also said they believe she was recruited to join the plot by colleen larose , another american convert who has been charged with recruiting people to carry out terrorist plots over the internet .
us prosecutors said larose , who used the online alias " jihad jane , " had pledged to carry out the murder of an unnamed swedish resident .
larose was arrested last fall .
artist lars vilks ' drawing appeared in a swedish newspaper in 2007 to illustrate an editorial about freedom of expression .
but the depiction attracted controversy and threats that mirrored those which followed a danish newspaper 's publication of several cartoons of muhammad , including one drawn so that the prophet 's turban resembled a bomb .
an iraqi group linked to al qaeda had offered a $ 100,000 reward for vilks ' murder .
vilks told reuters last wednesday that he had received further death threats in internet messages since the arrests were announced last week. svs / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ali charaf damache , a 44-year-old from algeria , was charged with sending a threatening text message .
abdul salam monsour khalil al-jahani , 32 , from libya , was charged with failing to show correct identity papers .
the charges , handed down by courts in dublin and waterford on monday , follow the release of five others arrested at the same time as damache and al-jahani .
two were algerian , one palestinian , one croatian and one american .
us news reports identified the american as 31-year-old islam convert jamie paulin ramirez .
ramirez 's mother and stepfather told reuters that damache and their daughter had recently married .
they also said they believe she was recruited to join the plot by colleen larose , another american convert who has been charged with recruiting people to carry out terrorist plots over the internet .
us prosecutors said larose , who used the online alias " jihad jane , " had pledged to carry out the murder of an unnamed swedish resident .
larose was arrested last fall .
artist lars vilks ' drawing appeared in a swedish newspaper in 2007 to illustrate an editorial about freedom of expression .
but the depiction attracted controversy and threats that mirrored those which followed a danish newspaper 's publication of several cartoons of muhammad , including one drawn so that the prophet 's turban resembled a bomb .
an iraqi group linked to al qaeda had offered a $ 100,000 reward for vilks ' murder .
vilks told reuters last wednesday that he had received further death threats in internet messages since the arrests were announced last week. svs / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .
on tuesday , the german bishops ' conference announced that a telephone hotline , for both victims and perpetrators , would be launched at the end of march. gb / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .
the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces acts as an advocate for the armed forces and reports to the parliament on the situation within the military. hf / afp / epd / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

he is the first german bank manager to face trial in connection with the banking crisis . " i have reached the conclusion that i am not to blame in a legal sense , " stefan ortseifen , 59 , told the duesseldorf court at the outset of the trial on tuesday . more than two and a half years after the ikb -lrb- deutsche industrie bank -rrb- bank stood at the brink of collapse , ortseifen is charged with breach of trust and manipulating share prices in a trial expected to run until the end of may . at the center of the charges is an ikb press release dated july 20th , 2007 , which portrayed the economic impact the financial crisis had on the bank in an overly positive way , the prosecution said .
" in the press release , mr. ortseifen is believed to have made misleading allegations , " prosecutor nils bussee said .
" we believe that his statements led to a temporary increase of ikb 's share prices . " but ortseifen told the court that the contents of the press release wre correct at the time it was issued .
the former ikb head said that deutsche bank triggered the crisis a week later when it froze its line of credit for the lender .
risk was foreseeable bussee said the press statement did not mention a $ 171 million -lrb- 124 million euros -rrb- risk that was already foreseeable , but gave the impression that the impact the us subprime crisis had on the bank was much less severe .
ulrich hartmann , a former head of ikb 's board of directors , said the crisis for the bank was not foreseeable .
" we did not stand a chance to recognize the risks and avert the threat to the bank , " he said .
" risk management systems all over the world failed , and supervisory boards did not notice . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "

he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .

those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .
on tuesday , the german bishops ' conference announced that a telephone hotline , for both victims and perpetrators , would be launched at the end of march. gb / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .

" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .

robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .

transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .

he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .

obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .

" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.03.2010 e-learning 's potential is hampered by misuse , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you can even " drink " beer with mobile apps , but they 're not just for entertainment the world of ' e-learning ' is growing more pervasive every day .
but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .
on tuesday , the german bishops ' conference announced that a telephone hotline , for both victims and perpetrators , would be launched at the end of march. gb / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .
the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces acts as an advocate for the armed forces and reports to the parliament on the situation within the military. hf / afp / epd / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .

berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 16.03.2010 berlusconi is said to be under investigation for trying to gag critical media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlusconi has a history of silencing criticism italian prime minister silvio berlusconi is reportedly under investigation for trying to axe a critical tv show .
prosecutors have allegedly recorded him pressuring the country 's media watchdog to block the show . italy 's prime minister is reportedly under investigation for corruption , misappropriation and abuse of office .
silvio berlusconi is accused of trying to pressure the country 's broadcasting commission agcom into keeping talk shows off the air that are critical of him .
the allegations against the prime minister are reportedly based on phone taps by prosecutors investigating political corruption .
transcripts of one alleged call show that berlusconi told a member of the agcom commission to " make a concerted effort to push rai tv to say : ' enough , we 're shutting everything down . " '
the thorn in the prime minister 's side is the talk show annozero on the traditionally pro-opposition rai tri channel , which is frequently critical of berlusconi 's politics and ridicules the sex scandals in his private life . italian media quote sources close to the investigation which suggest that berlusconi is formally under investigation for suspected abuse of office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister went on the offensive and said he was shocked that he had been tapped the prime minister 's lawyers , however , have not yet confirmed any such probe and have demanded that prosecutors should inform them about whether or not their famous client was in fact being investigated .
berlusconi himself said he was " shocked " by reports that his phone line had been tapped .
the allegations were " ridiculous and grotesque , " he said , adding that as prime minister he should have " the right to speak on the telephone without being overheard , especially without knowing it . "
censorship ?
critics of the prime minster see the incident as yet another example of how billionaire and media tycoon berlusconi is trying to keep the lid on any criticism directed at him from the media .
furio colombo is a long-time political commentator and founder of the italian daily newspaper the daily fact .
he said the current case was " a perfect equivalent to censorship . "
colombo said berlusconi has a long history of using his position in government to promote his business interests and to prevent any debate about his political leadership from reaching the airwaves or the front pages .
" he wants to suppress , to block any reports that stir the attention , the interest or the judgement of the citizens .
he wants to make sure that nothing will be published that will damage the power of the prime minister . "
bildunterschrift : rome frequently sees demonstrations against berlusconi .
last weekend tens of thousands of protestors took to the streets in rome controversy over phone tapping the investigation has also triggered another bitter debate in italy over the use of phone tapping .
berlusconi 's center-right coalition has drafted a law to limit its use by magistrates investigating crimes .
the country 's leading magistrates say the reforms are designed to protect those in power .
" the italian justice system and political power have been in conflict for some time now , " said milan investigative magistrate armando spataro .
" criticism and proposed reforms , therefore , have n't been made in the public interest , but often to protect the interests of politicians who are accused of crimes . "
spataro warned that berlusconi 's continued attack on wiretapping will mean fewer checks on power abuses and eliminate the most effective weapon against crime .
" we risk no longer being able to make any more progress against crime .
not just against terrorism and the mafia , but also political corruption . "
berlusconi insisted in a national radio broadcast that he was not worried about the content of the phone taps of his conversations with the media watchdog member .
he said , as prime minister , he had the right to speak on the phone with anybody without being recorded .
the controversy is the latest to hit berlusconi ahead of regional elections on march 28-29 .
only last weekend , tens of thousands marched in rome to protest against their prime minister .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .
the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces acts as an advocate for the armed forces and reports to the parliament on the situation within the military. hf / afp / epd / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

he broke this restriction , " the diocese of munich and freising in southern germany said in a statement after suspending the cleric .
peter h. had been permitted to switch to a different diocese in 1980 , after being accused of sexually abusing children .
he was transferred from the western german city of essen to southern germany where the archbishop of munich and freising at the time , joseph ratzinger , now the pontiff , approved giving church housing to the priest for " therapy " , the diocese said .
two years later , by which time archbishop ratzinger had moved to the vatican , peter h. was given pastoral duties in a bavarian town .
in 1986 , he was given a suspended jail term for sexually abusing children , but he remained in the church .
when the man 's past surfaced recently , it became impossible for the church to keep him in his post .
prelate joseph obermeier , a senior priest charged with overseeing peter h. , also handed in his resignation .
in further revelations , a monastery in st. ottilien in southern germany has acknowledged that several monks , now deceased , had admitted to acts of abuse in the 1960s .
it has appealed to victims to come forward .
five new cases of pedophilia have also been reported in the diocese of muenster in northwestern germany .
on tuesday , the german bishops ' conference announced that a telephone hotline , for both victims and perpetrators , would be launched at the end of march. gb / dpa / afp / kna / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "
an advocate for soldiers robbe is a member of the social democrats , a party no longer part of the government since elections last fall .
he is set to be replaced by helmut koenigshaus from the free democratic party .
the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces acts as an advocate for the armed forces and reports to the parliament on the situation within the military. hf / afp / epd / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.03.2010 government and economists defend germany 's roaring export machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has stacked up a trade surplus with some eurozone members german politicians and industry leaders are n't buying into french criticism that germany 's powerful export machine has come at the expense of its neighbors in the eurozone . it 's not the first time that germany and france have clashed over economic policy , nor will it be the last .
but this time , germany does n't appear willing to budge on what it has gained with considerable pain : a globally competitive export industry .
in an interview published monday in the financial times , french finance minister christine lagarde highlighted the trade imbalances that germany has created with several eurozone members , such as financially troubled greece and spain , by pushing for low labor costs and focusing heavily on exports .
the minister also suggested that germany boost long-stagnant domestic consumption to help these and other weaker eurozone nations increase exports and shore up their finances .
swift responses , mostly critical germany ships around 43 percent of its exports to countries within the 16-member eurozone , with about 12 percent of the total to southern european members , such as greece , italy , spain and portugal .
in 2009 , germany had a trade surplus of 12.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.6 billion -rrb- with spain at the high end , and 2.6 billion euros with portugal at the low end , according to eurostat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french finance minister lagarde wants german consumer spending to go up lagarde 's remarks drew swift responses , mostly critical , from german government officials and other economic experts inside and outside the country .
a german government spokesman said the idea of blocking an export economy went “ against the concept of competition in europe . ” economic policy , he added , should encourage companies to grow rather than forcing them “ to hold back artificially . ”
" we live in a global economy " while agreeing that there were german trade imbalances in the eurozone and that there was a need to boost consumer spending in the country , klaus schrader from the kiel institute for world economy said germany should n't be criticized for its highly export-driven economy .
“ we live in a global economy and have world markets , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ german companies , both big and small , have done their homework .
they are very competitive when it comes to quality and price .
i ca n't say the same of greek companies , for instance . ”
schrader also questioned whether a boost in german consumption would help greece directly .
no one , he said , can force german consumers to buy greek products if they are n't competitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer spending has stagnated for years to save german manufacturing from losing markets to lower-cost asian and eastern european rivals , the country 's companies over the past several years pushed through moderate wage deals to increase productivity .
but as wages stagnated or even dropped , consumers began to reduce spending – to make ends meet or save for a rainy day or both .
as a result , germany 's trade surplus grew and has n't stopped growing .
german consumer spending has been low “ i do n't want to say that greater german consumption would solve all the problems , ” said howard archer , chief european economist at his global insight in london .
“ but consumer spending has been low for a long period , partly because of lower wages and worries about job losses and retirement plans .
clearly , germans have had a reason to be cautious but maybe they 've been too cautious . ”
dirk schumacher , an economist with goldman sachs in frankfurt , said that planned tax cuts this year “ should support disposable income growth . ”
but , in the same breath , he warned eurozone partners not to over-estimate the effect on their trade balances if the german government policy brought about a surge in domestic spending .
nearly all economists agree that greece , spain and other struggling economies in the eurozone need to improve their competitiveness through tough reforms and wage policies founded on productivity .
“ they basically have to do what germany did , ” economist archer said .

the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robbe says his report is based on complaints from soldiers and visits to afghanistan the armed forces need more training , and more vehicles and weapons , he said in his report for 2009 , adding that there was a shortage of 600 military doctors .
due to a lack of armored vehicles , most training takes place onsite abroad , he said , meaning troops arrive unprepared .
" the military leadership has n't yet arrived at the realities of an army in combat , " he told the politicians , " and continues to fail the troops in providing everything that 's needed for them to fulfill their missions . "
in 2009 the military treated 466 cases of post-traumatic stress syndrome , double the number in 2008 .
almost 90 percent of those treated had served in nato 's international security assistance force mission in afghanistan , where robbe said soldiers faced war-like conditions .
despite the challenges facing them , robbe said the individual soldiers were doing an excellent job .
hazing abuse ' unacceptable ' robbe also touched on the recent accounts of hazing rituals within the bundeswehr .
robbe said he did not believe the problem was widespread .
however , he said such incidents as the forced eating of liver and drinking of alcohol to the point of vomiting that , according to soldier complaints , took place at a mountain infantry troop camp in bavaria , were not acceptable .
he also said the bundeswehr had an image problem that needed to be addressed .
" those who risk their health and lives for the good of germany expect the same degree of solidarity and respect from society that is common in other countries , " he said .
" we have n't been able to achieve this so it 's about time that official politics starts actively promoting this goal . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .

this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .

e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 16.03.2010 turkish activists want minister tried for derogatory comments on gays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's gay community is growing more vocal a political controversy has erupted in turkey after a minister described homosexuality as a " disease " that can and should be cured .
the comment provoked a strong reaction from the country 's gay and lesbian movement . turkey 's islamic-rooted government has frequently been criticized in the past by human rights groups over its treatment of the country 's gay community .
but now a turkish gay rights group has asked prosecutors to charge family affairs minister , aliye selma kavaf , for what they called her derogatory comments about homosexuality .
the complaint , by the lambda association , charges that kavaf 's remarks in a newspaper interview were " an insult , incitement to crime and incitement to enmity and hate " - crimes which , in turkey , are punishable by up to five years in jail .
kavaf had said that she believed homosexuality was a " biological disorder , a disease . " " i think it should be treated , " she was quoted as saying .
kavaf " should apologize to lesbians , gays , bisexuals , transvestites and transsexuals in this country for her discriminatory statements that turn homosexuals into a target , " said ruzgar gokce , a lambda member , outside the istanbul courthouse where the group filed its complaint .
" the only person who is sick , is the minister , " chanted dozens of gays and lesbians in front of the courthouse .
firat soyle , a lawyer for lambda , said the complaint was only symbolic since the minister enjoyed parliamentary immunity and would not face prosecution .
turkish society is changing however , the protest is an indication of how quickly turkish society is changing .
until recently , the gay and lesbian community was largely invisible .
but , in the last decade or so , it has become increasingly assertive .
one of the organizers of the demonstration , aykan safaoglu , told deutsche welle that , while he was angered by the minister 's comments , some good had come out of the controversy .
" i got really angry , but afterwards i was quite happy .
many ngos , parties and unions made supportive statements , so it was a very good sign .
many people just do n't think homosexuals are sick , " safaoglu said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prime minister 's ak party is socially conservative so far , the minister for women and family affairs has remained unmoved and refused to apologize .
kavaf 's tough stance may be due to prime minister recep tayyip erdogan refusing to reprimand her .
he has avoided commenting on the controversy , perhaps because many of his supporters in his islamic-rooted ak party are religious conservatives and sympathetic to minister kavaf 's views .
the controversy will raise eyebrows in brussels , where observers say there are growing questions about the sincerity of the islamic government 's commitment to implementing european union membership requirements .

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.03.2010 e-learning 's potential is hampered by misuse , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you can even " drink " beer with mobile apps , but they 're not just for entertainment the world of ' e-learning ' is growing more pervasive every day .
but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .

they can both be managed in an environmentally friendly way , while raising awareness among young people about responsible energy use . in september 2008 , the first eco-disco opened its doors .
not to worry : in rotterdam 's club watt , there 's no requirement to wear birkenstocks or eat muesli .
it 's all about partying , drinking , and dancing - even more so than in any other club .
beneath the dancers ' feet , the electromechanical dance floor is able to give a few millimeters , thanks to some very strong springs .
the pressure-sensitive floor is able to turn the energy from the movement into electricity .
thanks to its sustainable concept , club watt consumes 30 percent less external energy than a conventional disco , and has cut its co2 emissions by about a third .
bildunterschrift : in club watt , guests create much more than a hangover : each dancer generates up to 10 watts in order for people to be able to see what they 're doing , light bulbs light up the panels that make up the dance floor .
the faster people dance , the brighter it becomes .
it has an educational effect , say those behind the club 's concept : people who see themselves generating energy are more likely to reconsider how they use it .
" climate protection should be fun " in berlin , the techno club tresor has also jumped on the carbon-neutral bandwagon .
last january , it held its third sustainable " high voltage party . "
the organizers calculated that the entire amount of co2 emissions produced in the evening , and donated that value to a climate protection project that will save the same amount of emissions generated by the party .
" climate protection should be fun , " said jaap van den braak of the dutch company sustainable dance club -lrb- sdc -rrb- .
his company was involved in creating the concept for club watt .
but the approach of berlin 's tresor club - climate protection through emissions trading - would n't meet sdc 's sustainability criteria .
" as far as i know , club watt is still the only discotheque in all of europe that truly qualifies as sustainable , " said van den braak .
first carbon neutral university bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this end up : young greenpeace members install a panel of solar cells sdc developed its plan for environmentally-friendly clubbing together with the technical colleges in eindhoven and delft .
in addition to clubs , where students go to have fun on weekends , colleges and universities are other places that feature greatly in the lives of young people .
there too , people are discovering that when it comes to climate change , it 's best to act locally .
germany 's leuphana university in lueneburg is aiming to be the world 's first carbon neutral university by 2012 .
photovoltaic panels have already been installed on the roofs of the campus buildings to produce power , and a natural gas power plant helps heat the campus , as well as the nearby village .
courses in environmental studies have been offered at the university since 1996 .
but climate protection is also a topic in between lectures .
" we 've installed projectors in the cafeteria that show how much energy is currently being consumed in various buildings , " said wolfgang ruck , professor of environmental chemistry at leuphana university .
africa 's first eco-university valley view university in accra , ghana , has set itself an equally ambitious goal : it wants to become the first ecological university in africa .
solar panels are already providing energy to the entire campus , and a rain water collection system for flushing toilets is in the planning stages .
some of the toilets even work without any water at all .
" firstly , that solves the problem of water shortages , and secondly , fecal material can be composted and used as soil conditioner on farms , " explained emmanuel kwandahor of valley view .
" awareness has increased " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' we hope you can ' : kenyan students send an e-mail request to barack obama , asking him to do more for the climate " in the third world , climate protection is often linked to practical development aid , " said richard brand .
he coordinates the german department of solar generation , an international youth project run by greenpeace .
in kogelo , kenya , solar generation has installed solar cells on the roof of a school , thus providing power for the school 's laptops .
the computers allowed the students , who are from the same village as barack obama 's grandmother , to send an e-mail to the us president a few days before the start of the climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
in their mail , they asked him to do more to protect the climate .
solar generation does n't just aim to communicate its disapproval of how people in power deal with the environment to politicians ; it also wants other young people to be more conscious of how they consume energy .
" the awareness that something has to be done to stop climate change has increased greatly among young people in the last few years , " said brand .
maybe in part , because on the weekends , they dance until the lights come on .

but the recent wave of abuse claims across germany has revived the discussion . few , if any , catholic priests or bishops are likely to say their church 's vow of celibacy for priests is a direct cause of child sexual abuse .
yet the most recent wave of abuse allegations across germany and europe has reignited an ongoing debate in the church over whether priests should be allowed to marry .
hamburg bishop hans-jochen jaschke told the daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday that coexistence between celibate and married priests should be possible .
he added that while he saw no direct connection between the large number of abuse cases and priest celibacy , " the celibate lifestyle can attract people who have an abnormal sexuality . "
the president of the central committee of german catholics , alois glueck , also spoke out for dialogue on reforming the celibacy requirement .
" in other areas of society where celibacy plays no role , the problems -lsb- of sexual abuse -rsb- are ultimately not any less , " glueck told the regional daily passauer neue presse .
" but the issue of celibacy will come up in our debate for other reasons .
we have to think of solutions to the lack of priests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaschke says priests should be able to choose between celibacy or marriage ursula enders , founder and head of the sexual abuse victims outreach center zartbitter , was more inclined to draw a link , however small , between celibacy and sexual abuse .
" celibacy is not the cause of sexual abuse in the church , " she said in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" it 's something that makes the church more vulnerable . "
movement for reform the debate among german catholics over celibacy is certainly not a new one .
shortly after taking office as the head of the german catholic church , robert zollitsch made controversial public statements calling celibacy a " gift " but not " theologically necessary . "
controversy also arose in the case of michael sell , a former priest in the bavarian town of hammelburg who was dismissed from his job late last year after he revealed that he planned to marry his partner , with whom he had recently fathered a baby .
sell 's removal led to the founding of the action committee " church in movement " to support him .
early last month the group submitted more than 7,000 signatures to sell 's diocese urging his reinstatement and that priests be allowed to choose between marriage and celibacy .
indeed , about 80 percent of german catholics say they are in favor of allowing priests to marry , according to christian weisner , head of the reform-oriented catholic group wir sind kirche -lrb- we are church -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi strongly supports the vow of celibacy " if the pope would like to change the law of celibacy , he could do that with one signature , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i still hope that the holy spirit would bring the idea to the next pope . "
long road to change pope benedict xvi has long supported mandatory celibacy for priests and shows no signs of changing his mind .
still , weisner says the church must make sweeping reforms if it hopes to address the growing shortage of priests across the world .
" only to discuss celibacy - that 's not enough , " he said .
" we really need a new approach to sexuality , a new relationship between man and woman in our church . "
weisner denied that there was biblical justification for mandatory celibacy , and said the catholic church did not even have the policy during its first millennium of existence .
" the roman catholic church is only arguing with the tradition of the last 800 or 900 years , " he said .
" but we have to remember - traditions can be changed . "

but the number of deaths remains unclear , as well as the number of displaced people and people who have lost their homes . moshtarak means together in dari and the operation was supposed to launch a new tactic : a joint effort between afghan troops and nato forces against the taliban in the southern stronghold of helmand .
thousands of civilians fled the area of marjah .
those that stayed or have come back can not say that " operation moshtarak " has been a great success . abdul rahman is very critical but relieved at least that his family still has a roof over its head .
he explains that the americans used the doors of his house as firewood , whereas the taliban used the windows to shoot from . bildunterschrift : us soldiers exchange fire with taliban insurgents although the fiercest battles have subsided , he says the situation is far from calm : " many people and the media say that the operation is over but the government and isaf have still not managed to secure the territory .
the taliban still haunt the streets with their weapons and go unchallenged . " troops clear mines , taliban plant new ones abdullah can confirm this point of view .
his home was destroyed by the foreign troops and he now lives with his wife and small daughter at their neighbor 's . he says that such operations are bound to fail , considering the way they are conducted .
" the americans clear the taliban 's mines in the day and go back to their military bases at night , " explains .
" then the taliban come back and plant new ones .
and that ’ s how it goes – on and on . " " operation moshtarak " is not the first such offensive that the journalist mushtabar has witnessed in helmand province .
he says that there is little evidence left there of a previous operation in july 2009 . taliban destroy reconstruction work immediately he explains that the schools , which were built by foreign organizations after the operation , have since been burnt down by the taliban . " the problem is that the foreign troops withdraw straight after the operation and the reconstruction begins straightaway .
but the taliban come and destroy everything that is built .
this time , the operation did not bring much because the soldiers didn ’ t stay . "
mushtabar 's opinion is that the troops should stay put after such bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us marines patrol the deserted market of marjah in feb .
2010 - locals would like them to stay put after an operation offensives and this is also how those people he has spoken to in marjah reason .
" they all say that anyone who starts an operation here has to stay here and support them , whether it ’ s the government or the americans .
as it is , they say , they ’ re so scared that the taliban will come back and kill them if they help the americans . "
the inhabitants of the area argue that the fight against the taliban will only be successful if there is a long-term police and military presence in the area .
this would be a sign that the afghan government , foreign troops and the police are really working " together " towards peace and stability in the taliban stronghold of helmand .

but critics are asking whether the medium is being used to its best advantage - and some warn of a growing digital divide . learning vocabulary by cell phone ?
teaching a classroom of kids on the internet ?
exams via videoconference ?
all these methods are already in practice , part of the growing field of e-learning .
increasingly , schools and colleges are experimenting with ways to use modern technology to improve virtual education .
some students are meeting their teachers in chat rooms instead of classrooms .
others get vocabulary lists sent automatically to their cell phones once a week .
and archaeology students at britain 's university of leicester are studying antiquity by using a virtual-world game - second life - to reconstruct ancient societies . critical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online learning is popular among students who also work colleges and universities seem especially motivated to make use of the new possibilities that modern technology has to offer .
this goes particularly for universities that want to accommodate working students who are short on time .
but some critics wonder whether online educators are doing enough to use all the possibilities for extending the classroom .
e-learning often lacks creativity , they argue , saying it mostly consists of taped lectures being posted online .
ulrike tipp , a professor of commercial information technology at the wildau polytechnic university near berlin , argues that in order for digital educators to be successful , they need to think outside the box .
for too long , she said , the focus has been purely on technology .
" that means that we 've gotten to the point where we think that when the technology is working then everything is fine , " tipp said .
" but technology alone does n't do it .
and that 's what we 've seen .
many teaching platforms were empty platforms .
meaning that no one was really moved to use them .
you have to ask why that is . "
teaching social skills , remotely one could question whether or not students really want to have vocabulary lists sent to their cell phones - after all , mobile phones are associated more with fun and entertainment than with learning .
what 's more , a boring professor ca n't be rendered interesting just by virtue of watching him give a lecture online instead of live .
but another thing that has been largely missing up to now in the e-learning world is a social component , tipp argues .
certain skills , such as how to communicate and how to present oneself , are n't currently being taught in the virtual world .
so digital learning has been geared towards information exchange rather than cooperative learning .
it seems like that is soon to change , however .
" we are moving more and more toward instituting collaborative learning , where students exchange ideas , " tipp said .
" it 's the same principle as in the web 2.0 communities , and it is leading to some interesting collaborations . "
some experts , disappointed by the unfulfilled potential of the media , are now shifting the focus away from e-learning and on to a concept they call " blended learning ; " that 's where technology is used as a supplement to traditional classroom teaching .
what remains to be seen is whether students will actually take to some of the methods that are being offered .
digital haves vs. have-nots another issue that worries critics when it comes to e-learning is the apparent " digital divide " that is opening up between those who have access to high-speed connections and pricy technology , and those who do not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is web 2.0 the next wave in digital learning ?
granted , digital media is no longer only available to web designers and computer technicians .
but even for those who do , or could , have access , there is still often a gap between people who are comfortable using new technologies and those who are not .
" there is a problem of digital exclusion , " said e-learning expert graham attwell , who currently teaches at the university of bremen .
" and there is the problem of digital illiteracy , which continues to grow . "
indeed , the european union has set itself a goal of becoming a " digital single market " -lrb- i.e. , having universal broadband access -rrb- by 2013 .
some member states , like sweden and the netherlands , have all but reached that goal .
others , like britain , have further to go .
the problem is worse for those in developing countries who do n't have access to the needed hardware , software or electricity , attwell argued .
for them , a dangerous education gap could be opening .
he proposes some solutions to these problems , including making mobile technology less expensive ; and installing free high-speed wlan connections in educational institutions and public administration buildings .

it comes in the wake of israel 's latest expansion plans . speaking to deutsche welle ahead of a rare public meeting with rivals from hamas , nabil shaath , a palestinian chief negotiator and former foreign minister , said that in the two-decade peace process he had never faced an israeli government so opposed to making concessions .
" things have changed , " he said .
" we 've never had an israeli government like this one , publically saying i will continue to colonize and settle because this is my right .
i will keep the whole of the jordan valley , which is 40 percent of the west bank , israeli and i will not withdraw from one inch of jerusalem . "
shaath said the moderate palestinian authority , nominally authorised to lead negotiations with israel , had given america a chance to " restrain " the israeli government of benjamin netanyahu , but it had failed and that any chance of negotiations , even indirectly , were finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us vice president joseph biden , left , was left embarrassed by israel 's announcement to build new settlements .
israel 's ambassador in washington , michael oren , has called the situation " a crisis of historic proportions . " he said that relations between the two countries were the worst in 35 years , referring to the stand off between henry kissinger and prime minister yitzhak rabin over the israeli withdrawal from the sinai in the aftermath of the 1973 arab-israeli war . no land and no peace the rift was sparked during us vice president joe biden 's visit to israel and the palestinian territories last week during which israel 's interior ministry announced plans for 1,600 new jewish homes to be built in palestinian east jerusalem , despite president barack obama 's demand for a freeze on such illegal settlements .
the israeli plan to build new units in east jerusalem in the mainly ultra-orthodox ramat shlomo settlement , an area taken by israel in 1967 , but regarded by palestinians as part of their future capital , sparked outrage among palestinians and the obama administration alike .
" the speed at which jerusalem is being judaised and de-arabised has surpassed any period in the history of the peace process and is so alarming that we can not possibly continue giving cover to mr netanyahu that we are still negotiating while he is doing this , " said shaath .
" we came in to this thing on the basis of land for peace .
there is no land and there is no real peace .
but the land is being eaten piece by piece .
how do you keep negotiating that ?
there is a time you decide you can not continue this way .
you learn , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians say the ramat sholmo settlement is an integral part of their future capital us secretary of state hillary clinton has called the announcement " an insult " and warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that his government sent a " deeply negative signal " by undermining months of us diplomacy aimed at starting so-called proximity peace talks between the palestinians and israelis .
clinton demanded the israeli decision be reversed and called on israel to make a public declaration stating talks with the palestinians will deal with the conflict 's core issues : final status agreement on the borders of a palestinian state ; the right of palestinian refugees to return ; east jerusalem as a palestinian capital ; security arrangements ; water resources and settlement issues .
right to armed struggle fatah 's position on negotiations with israel was echoed by osama hamdan , a member of the hamas ' political bureau : " the peace process is dead . "
the last round of talks broke down in december as a result of israel 's devastating war on gaza , but had been revived by the us , despite the massive political and geographical division between the palestinian leadership .
fatah and hamas have long had a cantankerous relationship which came to a head after hamas won the 2006 palestinian elections .
heavy fighting in may 2007 between the two parties ended with hamas taking control of the gaza strip whilst fatah remained in control of the west bank .
the victory of hamas , an islamist movement sworn to the destruction of israel and listed as a terrorist organisation by the us and eu countries , led to sanctions and the suspending of foreign aid on which the palestinians depend .
aid to gaza has been promised to resume if hamas fulfils three core demands by the international community : recognise israel ; accept agreements made by the previous fatah-led administration ; and renounce violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in doha between hamas and fatah was the first public encounter since 2007 the two sides came together in doha this week for their first public meeting since the 2007 split for a special session of the so-called doha debates hosted by the qatar foundation .
although the two sides have tried to reconcile their differences , most recently in egyptian-brokered talks , no deal has so far been signed .
according to hamas ' hamdan one of the major stumbling blocks to reconciliation is their differing positions on the palestinian armed struggle .
" abu mazen totally opposes armed struggle against israel , whereas we believe resistance is a major tool in the struggle , " he told deutsche welle . " the question is not rockets , " said hamdan .
" the question is whether we have the right to resistance . "
to underline hamas ' position , hamdan cites future israeli plans for jewish settlements .
" when mitchell -lsb- us peace envoy to the middle east -rsb- came they announced the construction of 112 units in the west bank .
when biden came they announced 1,600 new units in jerusalem , and to hillary clinton they have announced plans of 50,000 new units , " said hamdan , referring to israel 's plans to build 50,000 more housing units in east jerusalem .
as for the proposed peace talks hamdan asked : " what 's the point ? "
obama 's priorities this may be the worst period in relations between traditionally strong allies us and israel , but neither hamas nor fatah appear to have any solutions to the divisions in the palestinian leadership .
what they can agree on is that president obama ´ s administration seems unable to extract from netanyahu any concessions that would help restart the peace process .
" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

" mr obama has too many things on his plate , " said fatah 's nabil shaath .
" number one is his domestic programme of health care reform , the financial situation and unemployment .
he 's already threatened with the loss of his majority in november 's elections and is therefore not willing to risk losing jewish votes . "
" number two is iran , then it 's getting us soldiers out of iraq and afghanistan , then protecting pakistan which has a nuclear arsenal .
we come number five or six . "

details of the plan , to be enacted only if athens can not solve its own problems , remain vague . euro-zone finance ministers sealed agreement on a strategy to mobilize aid to financially beleaguered greece - but only if absolutely necessary .
officials did not give full details of the deal , which would only be put into effect if european union auditors determined that greece was fighting a losing battle to resolve its economic woes .
luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , who chaired the talks , said ministers had clarified details " that will allow us to take a decision on a coordinated action , which could be activated swiftly in the case of need . "
but he remained vague about how a rescue package would operate , only ruling out granting loan guarantees - which would involve the rest of europe taking some liability for debt , which greece might fail to repay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker said that the details would allow coordinated action to be taken " the instrument would not consist of loan guarantees from euro-area countries to greece but probably of a coordinated action at european level , which would make bilateral aid available , " he said .
" all members of the euro zone will participate in this collective effort . "
the " technical details " would still have to be worked out , juncker said .
all 27 eu countries would have to take a final decision , although only the 16 euro-zone countries would provide any aid .
a statement from the eurogroup meeting said the " objective would not be to provide financing at average euro area interest rates , but to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole . "
struggle to finance debts greece is struggling with a 300-billion-euro -lrb- $ 410 billion -rrb- budget deficit and needs to raise 54 billion euros this year purely to finance its debts . the country has sold government bonds to refinance its debt , and analysts have said aid would only be necessary if athens were unable to sell more .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package will be provided by the countries that use the euro dutch finance minister jan kees de jager said that aid for greece would " follow the same methodology " as that provided by global crisis lender the international monetary fund .
such conditions would mean the imposition of drastic reforms and budget cuts .
as europe 's biggest economy , germany is reluctant to bail out greece and is demanding to see an effort from the country to repair its own finances .
athens this month unveiled extra austerity measures , including cuts in public sector pay and tax increases , with an aim to reduce deficit from 12.7 to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc - birdwatchers ' help needed for house sparrow survey british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help hampshire bbc radio solent listen live to bbc radio solent on iplayer listen again to bbc radio solent on iplayer bbc local hampshire things to do people & places tv & radio local bbc sites news sport weather travel neighbouring sites dorset surrey sussex wiltshire related bbc sites england page last updated at 08:52 gmt , tuesday , 16 march 2010 e-mail this to a friend printable version birdwatchers ' help needed for house sparrow survey numbers of house sparrows have fallen a new survey has been launched to chart the numbers of house sparrows in hampshire .
once common in urban gardens , the numbers of the small bird have dropped dramatically over the past 25 years .
rspb estimates put the drop in the population of sparrows at over 62 % .
hampshire county council is asking people to help experts find out the cause of the dramatic decline by counting sparrows they see around houses and open spaces .
chris packham , wildlife expert , television presenter and president of the hampshire ornithological society , said : " the house sparrow is a great british bird , it would be terrible if we did nothing to stop its disappearance . "
house sparrows house sparrows have a wingspan of 14-16cm and weigh 27-39g .
they have a body length of 15cm house sparrows breed in spring and summer and the untidy nest of grass and straw is generally built inside buildings or other holes , and sometimes free-standing in bushes .
they feed mainly on seeds , but will also eat other vegetable matter and insects .
it is thought that changing farming practices and modern house-building methods resulting in fewer nesting and feeding sites may be at the root of the decline .
other familiar uk birds , including the starling and swift are also experiencing a downward trend in numbers .
every hampshire resident is being asked to look and listen for signs of house sparrows and take part in the hampshire house sparrow survey which runs until 30 june .
any outdoor area can be a survey site - including gardens , balconies , allotments , parks , offices , farm buildings or school grounds .
sparrow watchers can to enter their sightings online at house sparrow survey website where there is also plenty of advice and tips on taking part , as well as information on how to encourage sparrows and other birds to visit your outdoor space .
it is also possible to report not seeing any sparrows - information which bird experts need as much as positive sightings .
hampshire county council libraries , country parks and information points will be supplying and collecting survey forms for anyone without access to the internet .
everyone who submits a record stands the chance to receive a house sparrow hotel - a specially designed bird box that houses several sparrow families , which reflects their communal nesting patterns in the wild .
