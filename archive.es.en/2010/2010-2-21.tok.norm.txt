only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.02.2010 new book depicts gordon brown as a bully as poll looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book could n't have come at a worse time for brown as he trails in the polls he screams , throws tantrums and physically intimidates his staff .
that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .
a difficult time for labour britain must hold elections before june , and although the labour party has been in power since 1997 , brown himself is untested at the ballot box .
he took the top job in 2007 when former prime minister tony blair stepped down .
opinion polls indicate a loss for the labour party , with voters unhappy about the struggling economy and the number of troops being killed in the unpopular war in afghanistan. hf / ap / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 21.02.2010 berlin film festival reaches climax with awards ceremony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semih kaplanoglu wins golden bear award for turkish film " bal " the berlin international film festival 's top accolade has gone to a touching tale of a young boy and his father , a beekeeper , whose existence is threatened by the sudden disappearance of the bees . the 2010 berlinale kept with its tradition and once again successfully mixed star power with a global perspective for its 60 anniversary festival .
this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .

" the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o .

" if nothing else takes its place , then it -lrb- the mission -rrb- ends , " balkenende said . but the prime minister said he was worried about the impact of the withdrawal on the netherlands ' international standing . " the moment the netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " he said . his comments came a day after he told reporters that the center-left labor party was quitting the coalition government over a dispute on whether to extend the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan .
balkende telephoned queen beatrix tendering the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the labour party pvda .
nato urges dutch to reconsider in a first reaction to the collapse of the ruling coalition , nato saturday renewed its call for dutch troops to remain in afghanistan for an additional 12 months in a more reduced capacity in its military mission . 2,000 dutch troops are currently stationed in the uruzgan province .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen wants the dutch to focus on training afghan forces after 2010 this new military mission would focus on the provincial reconstruction team in uruzgan , with greater emphasis on training , he said . " whatever happens after that date the afghan people can be sure that nato will continue to support them for as long as necessary , " appathurai added .
no middle ground on saturday , balkenende said the government 's collapse after 16 hours of tough negotiations was a defeat for both parties .
“ we ’ ve experienced this failure both individually and collectively as a defeat .
this doesn ’ t change anything about the facts or the conclusions we have reached , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wouter bos promised dutch troops they 'd be coming home prime minister balkenende 's christian democrat cda party , the senior coalition partner , had floated the idea of keeping a smaller force in afghanistan beyond this year 's deadline .
deputy prime minister wouter bos , whose labor party wants the afghan mission to end as soon as possible , had earlier promised " the last dutch soldier gone from uruzgan by the end of the year . "
prime minister balkenende said that he and his rival bos simply could n't reach a compromise .
" as the leader of the cabinet , i came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the cda -lsb- balkenende 's party -rsb- , the pvda -lsb- bos ' party -rsb- , and the christian union -lsb- junior partners -rsb- to take into the future . "
without bos ' labor party , balkenende 's coalition does not have the outright majority required to rule in holland .
the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan began in august 2006 , and has already been extended by two years .
21 dutch soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan .
german demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrate against german afghan deployment meanwhile , protests were held in berlin on saturday in opposition to germany ’ s ongoing troop presence in afghanistan .
german news agency dpa reported that between 600 and 2,000 demonstrators turned out to call for a recall of the country ’ s roughly 4,400 bundeswehr troops stationed in the north of the country . german foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- responded to the peaceful protests , organized by a number of left-wing political groups , warning that a withdrawal from afghanistan would be a " significant threat " to european security . on friday , the lower german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , will vote on whether to increase the number of german bundeswehr troops serving in nato-led isaf mission to more than 5,300 .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

" if nothing else takes its place , then it -lrb- the mission -rrb- ends , " balkenende said . but the prime minister said he was worried about the impact of the withdrawal on the netherlands ' international standing . " the moment the netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " he said . his comments came a day after he told reporters that the center-left labor party was quitting the coalition government over a dispute on whether to extend the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan .
balkende telephoned queen beatrix tendering the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the labour party pvda .
nato urges dutch to reconsider in a first reaction to the collapse of the ruling coalition , nato saturday renewed its call for dutch troops to remain in afghanistan for an additional 12 months in a more reduced capacity in its military mission . 2,000 dutch troops are currently stationed in the uruzgan province .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen wants the dutch to focus on training afghan forces after 2010 this new military mission would focus on the provincial reconstruction team in uruzgan , with greater emphasis on training , he said . " whatever happens after that date the afghan people can be sure that nato will continue to support them for as long as necessary , " appathurai added .
no middle ground on saturday , balkenende said the government 's collapse after 16 hours of tough negotiations was a defeat for both parties .
“ we ’ ve experienced this failure both individually and collectively as a defeat .
this doesn ’ t change anything about the facts or the conclusions we have reached , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wouter bos promised dutch troops they 'd be coming home prime minister balkenende 's christian democrat cda party , the senior coalition partner , had floated the idea of keeping a smaller force in afghanistan beyond this year 's deadline .
deputy prime minister wouter bos , whose labor party wants the afghan mission to end as soon as possible , had earlier promised " the last dutch soldier gone from uruzgan by the end of the year . "
prime minister balkenende said that he and his rival bos simply could n't reach a compromise .
" as the leader of the cabinet , i came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the cda -lsb- balkenende 's party -rsb- , the pvda -lsb- bos ' party -rsb- , and the christian union -lsb- junior partners -rsb- to take into the future . "
without bos ' labor party , balkenende 's coalition does not have the outright majority required to rule in holland .
the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan began in august 2006 , and has already been extended by two years .
21 dutch soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan .
german demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrate against german afghan deployment meanwhile , protests were held in berlin on saturday in opposition to germany ’ s ongoing troop presence in afghanistan .
german news agency dpa reported that between 600 and 2,000 demonstrators turned out to call for a recall of the country ’ s roughly 4,400 bundeswehr troops stationed in the north of the country . german foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- responded to the peaceful protests , organized by a number of left-wing political groups , warning that a withdrawal from afghanistan would be a " significant threat " to european security . on friday , the lower german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , will vote on whether to increase the number of german bundeswehr troops serving in nato-led isaf mission to more than 5,300 .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .
a difficult time for labour britain must hold elections before june , and although the labour party has been in power since 1997 , brown himself is untested at the ballot box .
he took the top job in 2007 when former prime minister tony blair stepped down .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 21.02.2010 berlin film festival reaches climax with awards ceremony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semih kaplanoglu wins golden bear award for turkish film " bal " the berlin international film festival 's top accolade has gone to a touching tale of a young boy and his father , a beekeeper , whose existence is threatened by the sudden disappearance of the bees . the 2010 berlinale kept with its tradition and once again successfully mixed star power with a global perspective for its 60 anniversary festival .
this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .

but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .

" if nothing else takes its place , then it -lrb- the mission -rrb- ends , " balkenende said . but the prime minister said he was worried about the impact of the withdrawal on the netherlands ' international standing . " the moment the netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " he said . his comments came a day after he told reporters that the center-left labor party was quitting the coalition government over a dispute on whether to extend the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan .
balkende telephoned queen beatrix tendering the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the labour party pvda .
nato urges dutch to reconsider in a first reaction to the collapse of the ruling coalition , nato saturday renewed its call for dutch troops to remain in afghanistan for an additional 12 months in a more reduced capacity in its military mission . 2,000 dutch troops are currently stationed in the uruzgan province .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen wants the dutch to focus on training afghan forces after 2010 this new military mission would focus on the provincial reconstruction team in uruzgan , with greater emphasis on training , he said . " whatever happens after that date the afghan people can be sure that nato will continue to support them for as long as necessary , " appathurai added .
no middle ground on saturday , balkenende said the government 's collapse after 16 hours of tough negotiations was a defeat for both parties .
“ we ’ ve experienced this failure both individually and collectively as a defeat .
this doesn ’ t change anything about the facts or the conclusions we have reached , ” he said .

deputy prime minister wouter bos , whose labor party wants the afghan mission to end as soon as possible , had earlier promised " the last dutch soldier gone from uruzgan by the end of the year . "
prime minister balkenende said that he and his rival bos simply could n't reach a compromise .
" as the leader of the cabinet , i came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the cda -lsb- balkenende 's party -rsb- , the pvda -lsb- bos ' party -rsb- , and the christian union -lsb- junior partners -rsb- to take into the future . "
without bos ' labor party , balkenende 's coalition does not have the outright majority required to rule in holland .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .

also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .
a difficult time for labour britain must hold elections before june , and although the labour party has been in power since 1997 , brown himself is untested at the ballot box .

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

he finished behind swede marcus hellner . angerer finished 2.1 seconds behind hellner , with another swede , johan olsson , receiving the bronze after leading for much of the closing freestyle stage of the race .
the swedes used team tactics commonly seen in the tour de france , such as attempting to disrupt the tempo of the race and blocking rivals from challenging for the lead .

of angerer 's german compatriots , jens filbrich finished in sixth place , 13.6 seconds behind the pace , while rene sommerfeldt came in 21st , and tom reichelt rounded off the german team 's performance by ranking 35th .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if nothing else takes its place , then it -lrb- the mission -rrb- ends , " balkenende said . but the prime minister said he was worried about the impact of the withdrawal on the netherlands ' international standing . " the moment the netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " he said . his comments came a day after he told reporters that the center-left labor party was quitting the coalition government over a dispute on whether to extend the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan .
balkende telephoned queen beatrix tendering the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the labour party pvda .
nato urges dutch to reconsider in a first reaction to the collapse of the ruling coalition , nato saturday renewed its call for dutch troops to remain in afghanistan for an additional 12 months in a more reduced capacity in its military mission . 2,000 dutch troops are currently stationed in the uruzgan province .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen wants the dutch to focus on training afghan forces after 2010 this new military mission would focus on the provincial reconstruction team in uruzgan , with greater emphasis on training , he said . " whatever happens after that date the afghan people can be sure that nato will continue to support them for as long as necessary , " appathurai added .
no middle ground on saturday , balkenende said the government 's collapse after 16 hours of tough negotiations was a defeat for both parties .
“ we ’ ve experienced this failure both individually and collectively as a defeat .
this doesn ’ t change anything about the facts or the conclusions we have reached , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wouter bos promised dutch troops they 'd be coming home prime minister balkenende 's christian democrat cda party , the senior coalition partner , had floated the idea of keeping a smaller force in afghanistan beyond this year 's deadline .
deputy prime minister wouter bos , whose labor party wants the afghan mission to end as soon as possible , had earlier promised " the last dutch soldier gone from uruzgan by the end of the year . "
prime minister balkenende said that he and his rival bos simply could n't reach a compromise .
" as the leader of the cabinet , i came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the cda -lsb- balkenende 's party -rsb- , the pvda -lsb- bos ' party -rsb- , and the christian union -lsb- junior partners -rsb- to take into the future . "
without bos ' labor party , balkenende 's coalition does not have the outright majority required to rule in holland .
the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan began in august 2006 , and has already been extended by two years .
21 dutch soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan .
german demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrate against german afghan deployment meanwhile , protests were held in berlin on saturday in opposition to germany ’ s ongoing troop presence in afghanistan .
german news agency dpa reported that between 600 and 2,000 demonstrators turned out to call for a recall of the country ’ s roughly 4,400 bundeswehr troops stationed in the north of the country . german foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- responded to the peaceful protests , organized by a number of left-wing political groups , warning that a withdrawal from afghanistan would be a " significant threat " to european security . on friday , the lower german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , will vote on whether to increase the number of german bundeswehr troops serving in nato-led isaf mission to more than 5,300 .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if nothing else takes its place , then it -lrb- the mission -rrb- ends , " balkenende said . but the prime minister said he was worried about the impact of the withdrawal on the netherlands ' international standing . " the moment the netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " he said . his comments came a day after he told reporters that the center-left labor party was quitting the coalition government over a dispute on whether to extend the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan .
balkende telephoned queen beatrix tendering the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the labour party pvda .
nato urges dutch to reconsider in a first reaction to the collapse of the ruling coalition , nato saturday renewed its call for dutch troops to remain in afghanistan for an additional 12 months in a more reduced capacity in its military mission . 2,000 dutch troops are currently stationed in the uruzgan province .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen wants the dutch to focus on training afghan forces after 2010 this new military mission would focus on the provincial reconstruction team in uruzgan , with greater emphasis on training , he said . " whatever happens after that date the afghan people can be sure that nato will continue to support them for as long as necessary , " appathurai added .
no middle ground on saturday , balkenende said the government 's collapse after 16 hours of tough negotiations was a defeat for both parties .
“ we ’ ve experienced this failure both individually and collectively as a defeat .
this doesn ’ t change anything about the facts or the conclusions we have reached , ” he said .

deputy prime minister wouter bos , whose labor party wants the afghan mission to end as soon as possible , had earlier promised " the last dutch soldier gone from uruzgan by the end of the year . "
prime minister balkenende said that he and his rival bos simply could n't reach a compromise .
" as the leader of the cabinet , i came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the cda -lsb- balkenende 's party -rsb- , the pvda -lsb- bos ' party -rsb- , and the christian union -lsb- junior partners -rsb- to take into the future . "
without bos ' labor party , balkenende 's coalition does not have the outright majority required to rule in holland .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 21.02.2010 germany urges catholic church to come clean on child abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports of sexual abuse by priests have caused outrage in germany the german government has called on the catholic church to play a proactive role in clarifying the widening allegations of clerical sex abuse at catholic schools throughout the country . " i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

" on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .

but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .
a difficult time for labour britain must hold elections before june , and although the labour party has been in power since 1997 , brown himself is untested at the ballot box .
he took the top job in 2007 when former prime minister tony blair stepped down .
opinion polls indicate a loss for the labour party , with voters unhappy about the struggling economy and the number of troops being killed in the unpopular war in afghanistan. hf / ap / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .

the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .

included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .

thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .

nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .

families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 21.02.2010 berlin film festival reaches climax with awards ceremony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semih kaplanoglu wins golden bear award for turkish film " bal " the berlin international film festival 's top accolade has gone to a touching tale of a young boy and his father , a beekeeper , whose existence is threatened by the sudden disappearance of the bees . the 2010 berlinale kept with its tradition and once again successfully mixed star power with a global perspective for its 60 anniversary festival .
this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de environment minister stands firm on nuclear power plant closure germany 's embattled environment minister has thrown his weight behind shutting down the country 's nuclear reactors .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .
a difficult time for labour britain must hold elections before june , and although the labour party has been in power since 1997 , brown himself is untested at the ballot box .
he took the top job in 2007 when former prime minister tony blair stepped down .
opinion polls indicate a loss for the labour party , with voters unhappy about the struggling economy and the number of troops being killed in the unpopular war in afghanistan. hf / ap / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .

" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

" i expect concrete information from the catholic church on measures taken for a complete clarification -lrb- of this matter -rrb- , " german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told newsmagazine der spiegel in an interview which will be published on monday , february 22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded more from the church the minister called for an ombudsman to investigate the case , and proposed a meeting between representatives from germany 's 16 states , the church and victims of clerical sexual abuse .
such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
the german politician leveled criticism at the bishop of augsburg , walter mixa , who she said was " hiding behind polemic excuses instead of contributing to clearing up " the matter .
the controversial bishop had previously told a local newspaper that the media and the " so-called sexual revolution " were partly to blame for the problem of child abuse in society .
damaging allegations the minister 's comments come to a backdrop of a widening scandal involving allegations of sexual molestation at catholic schools throughout germany dating back to the 1960s .
according to media reports , at least six schools were implicated in the claim .
included are two former children 's homes of the catholic order the salesians of don bosco in berlin and the bavarian town of augsburg , as well as institutions run by marists , vincentians and franciscans .
the most prominent of these involves as many as 115 alleged cases of child abuse at a berlin jesuit school .
the matter is currently under investigation .
hamburg archbishop werner thissen said the scandal was the result of " structural problems " in the church .
thissen added it was in the church 's interests to do everything it could to help clear up the abuse allegations .
an association of catholic lay people , " we are the church " , has also called on bishops to come clean , and admit that cases that have come to light are not isolated . association spokeswoman sigrid grabmeier said german pope benedict xvi should make a statement urgently . dfm / afpd / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if nothing else takes its place , then it -lrb- the mission -rrb- ends , " balkenende said . but the prime minister said he was worried about the impact of the withdrawal on the netherlands ' international standing . " the moment the netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " he said . his comments came a day after he told reporters that the center-left labor party was quitting the coalition government over a dispute on whether to extend the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan .
balkende telephoned queen beatrix tendering the resignations of the ministers and deputy ministers of the labour party pvda .
nato urges dutch to reconsider in a first reaction to the collapse of the ruling coalition , nato saturday renewed its call for dutch troops to remain in afghanistan for an additional 12 months in a more reduced capacity in its military mission . 2,000 dutch troops are currently stationed in the uruzgan province .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen formally requested the netherlands to assume a new training role earlier this month and postpone withdrawing its 2,000 troops this year when its current mandate expires . but alliance spokesman james appathurai acknowledged that it was a decision the dutch government had to reach . " this is a dutch discussion which nato respects , " appathurai told afp news agency . but he added that nato secretary-general rasmussen " continues to believe that the best way forward for the overall mission could be a new smaller dutch operation after august 201o . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen wants the dutch to focus on training afghan forces after 2010 this new military mission would focus on the provincial reconstruction team in uruzgan , with greater emphasis on training , he said . " whatever happens after that date the afghan people can be sure that nato will continue to support them for as long as necessary , " appathurai added .
no middle ground on saturday , balkenende said the government 's collapse after 16 hours of tough negotiations was a defeat for both parties .
“ we ’ ve experienced this failure both individually and collectively as a defeat .
this doesn ’ t change anything about the facts or the conclusions we have reached , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wouter bos promised dutch troops they 'd be coming home prime minister balkenende 's christian democrat cda party , the senior coalition partner , had floated the idea of keeping a smaller force in afghanistan beyond this year 's deadline .
deputy prime minister wouter bos , whose labor party wants the afghan mission to end as soon as possible , had earlier promised " the last dutch soldier gone from uruzgan by the end of the year . "
prime minister balkenende said that he and his rival bos simply could n't reach a compromise .
" as the leader of the cabinet , i came to the conclusion that there is no common road for the cda -lsb- balkenende 's party -rsb- , the pvda -lsb- bos ' party -rsb- , and the christian union -lsb- junior partners -rsb- to take into the future . "
without bos ' labor party , balkenende 's coalition does not have the outright majority required to rule in holland .
the netherlands ' military mission in afghanistan began in august 2006 , and has already been extended by two years .
21 dutch soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan .
german demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters demonstrate against german afghan deployment meanwhile , protests were held in berlin on saturday in opposition to germany ’ s ongoing troop presence in afghanistan .
german news agency dpa reported that between 600 and 2,000 demonstrators turned out to call for a recall of the country ’ s roughly 4,400 bundeswehr troops stationed in the north of the country . german foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- responded to the peaceful protests , organized by a number of left-wing political groups , warning that a withdrawal from afghanistan would be a " significant threat " to european security . on friday , the lower german lower house of parliament , the bundestag , will vote on whether to increase the number of german bundeswehr troops serving in nato-led isaf mission to more than 5,300 .

" on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.02.2010 new book depicts gordon brown as a bully as poll looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book could n't have come at a worse time for brown as he trails in the polls he screams , throws tantrums and physically intimidates his staff .
that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .

home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .
" i do n't think he has really been cut out for it . "
however , " the main reason we should decide to have a change in government is because of the bigger issues , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits do n't want a " shrinking violet , " mandelson said in defense of brown but labour allies lined up to defend their prime minister .
home secretary alan johnson told the bbc he had known brown for 17 years and had " never " heard him swear or raise his voice .
also speaking to the bbc , business secretary peter mandelson admitted that brown was demanding , both of his staff and of himself , but said he did not abuse his staff .
" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .
a difficult time for labour britain must hold elections before june , and although the labour party has been in power since 1997 , brown himself is untested at the ballot box .

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .

" he knows what he wants to do … he will go on and on until he 's got a policy or an idea in the best possible form which he can then roll out , " he said .
" on the way , yes , there is a degree of impatience about the man , but what would you like , some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government when we 're going through such storm waters ? " he said .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .
it is based on the life of the actor who saw his career ruined by starring in the original film . comedies still scarce despite festival director dieter kosslick 's desire to feature more comedies at the berlinale , only two of the 20 films in the main competition offered comic relief .
french veteran gerard depardieu charmed audiences in his latest film " mammuth " while the norwegian entry " a somewhat gentle man " , directed by hans petter moland , warms into a dark comedy .
with the serious nature of most of the films presented this year - you ca n't but hope that dieter kosslick 's wish might be granted in 2011 - and a few more film directors decide it is time the world had a bit of a laugh .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .
it stars ewan mcgregor as the nameless writer and pierce brosnan as a former british prime minister , reminiscent of tony blair . china well represented chinese director wang quan 'an 's story of the bittersweet reunion of a couple divided for decades across the taiwan strait , won the silver bear for the best screen play .
" what is important to me is the life of the common people and their emotions , " wang quan 'an said , " it 's a tragedy our country is divided .
of course it 's a tragedy for any country that is divided . "
this was the chinese director 's second major accolade from the festival after winning the golden bear in 2007 . bildunterschrift : scene from ' tuan yuan ' -lrb- apart together -rrb- - best screenplay multiple awards for russia russia 's " how i ended this summer " was a multiple winner , with grigori dobrygin and sergei puskepalis sharing the best actor award and director alexei popogrebsky picking up an outstanding artistic contribution prize .
best actress went to shinobu terajima for the harrowing japanese war drama " caterpillar . "
families on the big screen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for us actress julianne moore families too were a leitmotif of this year 's festival .
while the danish film " a family " follows the trials and tribulations of a renowned family of bakers , actresses julianne moore and annette bening teamed up for the film " the kids are all right " in which they play a long-term lesbian couple whose lives are turned upside down when their two teenaged children contact their biological father .
moore said " for me the portrait is very much the portrait of a marriage and a family and about what it 's like to be married for a long time and to have children .
i do n't think it matters what your sexuality is . ”
disappointment perhaps the big disappointment of this year 's berlinale was german director oskar roehler 's much anticipated film " jew suss : rise and fall . "
the big-budget film was germany 's contender in the competition but was booed throughout the premiere screening .
the wartime drama tells the tale of a 1940 anti-semitic propaganda movie .

such a gathering would be " a good way to clear up the numerous abuse cases and to offer the opportunity to the catholic church to discuss voluntary compensation with victims , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .

this year 's contenders for the golden bear ranged from chinese tales of reunification through to entries from bosnia and iran and even included star director roman polanski 's latest thriller .
but also true to its reputation , the winning films tell stories that go far beyond the silver screen . the surprise winner of the much-coveted golden bear was the turkish drama " bal " -lrb- honey -rrb- .
it tells the story of a young boy who ventures into the woods to find his missing father , a beekeeper .
one day the bees suddenly disappear , throwing into question the family 's means of earning a living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first golden bear for a turkish film since 1964 " bal " is the final installment of director semih kaplanoglu 's trilogy which began with " milk " and " egg . "
filmed in turkey 's mountainous forests , " bal " utilizes little music and sparse dialogue to tell its tale .
memorable is the acclaimed performance by the young bora altas as six-year-old yusuf , whose character must come to terms with momentous changes at a tender age .
" if i want to whistle , i whistle " - a prison drama about a teenager 's desperate bid to escape , won the runner-up jury prize and the alfred-bauer award for cinematic innovation .
with this film , director florin şerban ’ s hopes to throw the spotlight on the plight of young offenders in romania .
the drama tells the tale of silviu , a young delinquent , about to be released from reform school , who in desperation to keep his family together , kidnaps a young social worker and holds the school under siege .
best director award causes controversy the decision to award the berlinale silver bear for best director to roman polanski , caused some controversy .
the 76-year-old polish director is under house arrest in switzerland , facing possible extradition to the united states over a sex offence dating back to 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conspicious by his absence , roman polanksi in a statement read out by the film 's producer alain sarde , polanski said : " even if i could i would n't go , because the last time i went to a festival to get a prize i ended up in jail . "
polanski 's " the ghost writer " is a political thriller based on a novel by robert harris .

chancellor merkel has distanced herself from comments by the environment minister that germany could phase out its nuclear plants by 2030 . a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel on sunday pointed to an agreement by the ruling coalition that envisioned the environment and economic ministries together developing strategies for germany 's energy supply over the next decades . " on this basis , we 'll decide in fall how long nuclear energy will be used as a ' bridging technology ' , " ulrich wilhelm told newspaper welt am sonntag . any other commitments made before that would be too " premature , " he said . wilhelm was referring to comments by german environment minister norbert roettgen , a member of merkel 's conservative party , that nuclear energy could be replaced by renewable energy by 2030 . " the proportion of renewable energy must increase from today 's 16 percent to 40 percent . "
roettegen said in an interview with newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday .
even based on the most sceptical assumptions , he said , nuclear power will no longer be needed by 2030 .
the aim must be " to almost completely switch to renewable energy , " roettgen said .
roettgen breaks with government line earlier this year , roettgen caused a rift in the ruling coalition by breaking with the government 's line by suggesting that it should consider scrapping plans to extend the life spans of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : roettgen , left , has ruffled feathers in the ruling coalition chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition of conservatives and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- plans to extend the lives of 17 nuclear plants , which were originally to have been shut down by the mid-2020s under a decision taken by a previous center-left government in 2002 .
but guenther oettinger , another member of merkel 's party and the new eu energy commissioner , said on saturday that there was " no end in sight " for the use of nuclear energy in europe .
in an interview with newspaper hamburger abendblatt , oettinger pointed to sweden , which has reversed its planned nuclear phase-out .
he said eastern european nations in particular wanted to continue to use nuclear energy " in the long run . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .

that 's how excerpts published sunday from a new book on britain 's labour party , describe prime minister gordon brown .
brown has denied the allegations . published in the observer on sunday , excerpts from ' the end of the party , ' by political journalist andrew rawnsley depict brown as a verbally abusive bully to his staff .
the book could further damage prime minister gordon brown 's chances of election this year .
brown is already trailing in opinion polls and his defeat could end labour 's 13-year stint in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rawnsley 's book could further dent brown 's sliding popularity author rawnsley claims that sir gus o 'donnell , the cabinet secretary , " felt compelled to directly confront the prime minister and give him a stern ' pep ' talk about his conduct towards the staff . "
according to rawnsley , the conduct that led to that pep talk included screaming and swearing at staff , grabbing an aide by the collar of his shirt , pushing aside a secretary who he felt was n't typing fast enough and taking over the keyboard .
rawnsley wrote that brown 's staff was " afraid of him because he was always shouting at people , being unpleasant , constantly blaming people for things going wrong . "
on saturday , ahead of the publication , brown defended himself in a television interview , saying he had never hit anybody .
" if i get angry , i get angry with myself , " he said .
" i do n't do these sorts of things .
his official spokesman released a statement on sunday rejecting the portrayal .
" these malicious allegations are totally without foundation , " it said .
book divides politicians prominent conservative william hague told sky news on sunday that the descriptions of brown in the book raised doubts about his ability to lead the country .
" i do n't think he has ever shown that he can lead a happy team and a successful team , " he said .

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only one-goal difference puts leverkusen ahead of bayern munich , who drew 1-1 against nuremberg on saturday .
ironically , the old record of consecurtive games unbeaten had been set during the 1988-1989 season by bayern - then coached by none other than heynckes .
it was only a late goal by bremen 's per mertesacker in injury time that kept leverkusen from a win , which would have given them a two-point lead over bayern .
also on sunday , third-placed schalke slipped further behind the table toppers with a 2-1 loss to last season 's champions wolfsburg .
while schalke dominated for most of the game , grafite scored two goals within six minutes in the second half to secure victory .
schalke now sit four points behind leverkusen and bayern .
wolfsburg should have had the lead from the beginning , but a goal by edin dzeko in the 12th minutes was wrongly called offside by the referee .
at the other end of the table , hertha berlin beat freiburg 3-0 in sunday 's early fixture .
both teams are fighting to avoid relegation .
while berlin remains at the bottom with just 15 points , it 's now four points away from the safety of 15th place - where freiburg currently sits. hf / afp / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
