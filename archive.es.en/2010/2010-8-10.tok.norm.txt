program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 10.08.2010 carers outnumber autoworkers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for care is rising , but despite job increases , germany lacks carers the provision of care for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany employs more people than the country 's automotive industry , a study by an economic research institute has found . the provision of care has become one of the most in-demand services in the german economy , according to a study by wifor , an institute for financial and economic research at the technical university in darmstadt .
the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .

this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

"
the comments follow a stern defense of the raid by israel 's prime minister . israeli defense minister ehud barak has told a special israeli commission that a gaza-bound aid flotilla seized in a bloody commando raid in may was a " planned provocation " and that israel had expected a violent dispute weeks in advance .
barak said during discussions going back to april " the image that emerged ... was that the organizations -lsb- behind the flotilla -rsb- were preparing for armed conflict to embarrass israel . "
the former prime minister was the second of three top officials to give sworn testimony before an israeli investigative panel established to examine the legality of the raid that left nine turkish activists dead .
" we regret any loss of life , " barak told the panel .
" but we would have lost more lives if we had behaved differently . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak essentially blamed the deaths on the convoy 's organizers skirmished erupted on the flotilla vessels on may 31 after israeli commandos rappelled aboard in an attempt to stop the ships from breaking a naval blockade of the gaza strip .
activists on board the ships say the troops began firing immediately , whereas military personnel say they were retaliating after being attacked after boarding .
in ' accordance with the law ' on monday , prime minister benjamin netanyhu testified that israel had done nothing wrong .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lsb- israeli defense forces -rsb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid on monday .
the bloodshed was a huge blow to diplomatic relations with turkey and drew sharp rebukes from the international community over the severity of the response to the flotilla by israeli forces .
the un has launched a separate probe into the matter , but israel has made it clear it will not allow the troops involved to be questioned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.08.2010 germany shorn of world cup stars for friendly match against denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew has used his head and left his stars at home germany 's first match since the world cup has the potential to cause a ruckus between the country 's leading clubs and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over its timing .
luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.08.2010 germany shorn of world cup stars for friendly match against denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew has used his head and left his stars at home germany 's first match since the world cup has the potential to cause a ruckus between the country 's leading clubs and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over its timing .
luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .
olsen rings the changes after disappointing world cup coach morten olsen has also left out a number of bundesliga players - daniel jensen of werder bremen , vfl wolfsburg 's thomas kahlenberg , as well as msv duisburg forward soren larsen - but these and other omissions are said to be part of a squad shake-up and not prompted by any pressure from the players ' german clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark ended the world cup without even one win olsen is also leaving out arsenal 's nicklas bendtner and feyenoord 's jon dahl tomasson , while christian poulsen has been allowed to stay behind in italy to continue negotiations on his expected transfer from juventus to liverpool .
with september 's euro 2012 qualifier against iceland in mind , olsen is including world cup players thomas sorensen , lars jacobsen , simon kjaer , daniel agger , per kroldrup , and simon poulsen in his squad to support a host of fringe players and new faces he hopes will give denmark a fighting chance at the euros .
fc utrecht 's michael silberbauer , mads junker of roda jc and nec nijmegen 's lasse schone could gain more experience , while sonderjyske 's johnny thomsen and fc groningen 's nicklas pedersen could make their debuts against germany .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 10.08.2010 massive ice sheet breaks away from greenland glacier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say this is the largest ice sheet to calve in almost 50 years researchers say a floating ice sheet more than four times the size of new york 's manhattan island could eventually enter shipping lanes or run into oil platforms while drifting south . a giant sheet of ice totaling 260 square kilometers -lrb- 100 square miles -rrb- has broken off an ice shelf in greenland .
while the country has experienced massive glacial loss due to melting in recent decades , experts say it is unclear if this particular glacial event is connected to climate change .
trudy wohlleben , a researcher with the canadian ice service , got quite a surprise when she discovered the gigantic iceberg .
while reviewing nasa satellite images , she noticed that a massive ice island had torn away from petermann 's glacier , on greenland 's northwest coast .
it 's common for glaciers to shed ice - a process called calving - but this size of ice island is rare .
" what 's special about this one is that it is just so much bigger than anything that 's calved recently .
the sheer size .
everyone 's so excited , " wohlleben said in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs can cause problems for shipping routes the enormous sheet of ice is said to be four times the size of manhattan .
" if you are on a ship it would look like a big wall of ice rising out of the ocean .
it is up about five or 10 meters above the water , " wohlleben explained .
the ice sheet is now headed towards the nares strait , a waterway between northern canada and greenland .
scientists are concerned that it may eventually flow right out into the north atlantic .
that would be a big headache for the shipping and oil industries which are based off canada 's east coast .
" there 's a chance larger chunks will come down into shipping lanes and towards the oil platforms , " wohlleben said .
" if they are too big , then towing and waterbomber techniques to break up the iceberg will be much more difficult to apply . "
ice sheet movement unpredictable dr. martin melles , a professor of geology at the university of cologne , explained that 90 percent of the massive ice island is beneath the water .
if it drifts into the ocean , it will be difficult to see and will require monitoring .
he 's confident that modern technology will help avoid serious accidents at sea .
" this is not the time of the titantic .
nowadays , icebergs can be observed by satellites .
or even positioned with a censor so that they can always can be found , even if the weather is bad , " melles said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but melles is concerned that the ice island will run aground .
" according to its geological location and marine currents , it 's expected this iceberg will go southwards to newfoundland and labrador and ultimately end up in the north atlantic , " said melles .
if it strays into shallow water , the geologist said its huge base will likely be lodged for decades before it breaks free again .
" we can not know where this might happen .
it could happen in the shipping lanes , " melles said .
economic deep freeze now shipping and oil industries are keeping close watch on the ice island as it travels through the nares strait .
alexander yusfin works for the shipping company poseidon freighting and believes this glacier could be bad news for his shippers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers track glacial movements in greenland and the arctic " we can not go through if there is big ice .
that 's going to be a big delay .
but it depends on climate and we ca n't control the weather .
these ships carry 6,000 containers .
and if they are stuck , they 're stuck . "
global warming scientists have said global temperatures in the first half of 2010 were the highest on record .
temperatures in large parts of the arctic have risen faster than the global average in recent decades .
but melles says it remains unclear if this particular ice event is actually a result of climate change .
" most of greenland is lost as a result of melting .
with respect to petermann , experts estimate 80 percent is lost by melting and less than 20 percent by calving , " said the geologist .
he added that it is possible that the increased melting may have caused increased calving .
but that is hard to prove , since scientists can not easily access the underside of icebergs .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .

" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .

frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .

during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 10.08.2010 carers outnumber autoworkers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for care is rising , but despite job increases , germany lacks carers the provision of care for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany employs more people than the country 's automotive industry , a study by an economic research institute has found . the provision of care has become one of the most in-demand services in the german economy , according to a study by wifor , an institute for financial and economic research at the technical university in darmstadt .
the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.08.2010 germany shorn of world cup stars for friendly match against denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew has used his head and left his stars at home germany 's first match since the world cup has the potential to cause a ruckus between the country 's leading clubs and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over its timing .
luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .
olsen rings the changes after disappointing world cup coach morten olsen has also left out a number of bundesliga players - daniel jensen of werder bremen , vfl wolfsburg 's thomas kahlenberg , as well as msv duisburg forward soren larsen - but these and other omissions are said to be part of a squad shake-up and not prompted by any pressure from the players ' german clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark ended the world cup without even one win olsen is also leaving out arsenal 's nicklas bendtner and feyenoord 's jon dahl tomasson , while christian poulsen has been allowed to stay behind in italy to continue negotiations on his expected transfer from juventus to liverpool .
with september 's euro 2012 qualifier against iceland in mind , olsen is including world cup players thomas sorensen , lars jacobsen , simon kjaer , daniel agger , per kroldrup , and simon poulsen in his squad to support a host of fringe players and new faces he hopes will give denmark a fighting chance at the euros .
fc utrecht 's michael silberbauer , mads junker of roda jc and nec nijmegen 's lasse schone could gain more experience , while sonderjyske 's johnny thomsen and fc groningen 's nicklas pedersen could make their debuts against germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 10.08.2010 carers outnumber autoworkers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for care is rising , but despite job increases , germany lacks carers the provision of care for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany employs more people than the country 's automotive industry , a study by an economic research institute has found . the provision of care has become one of the most in-demand services in the german economy , according to a study by wifor , an institute for financial and economic research at the technical university in darmstadt .
the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.08.2010 germany shorn of world cup stars for friendly match against denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew has used his head and left his stars at home germany 's first match since the world cup has the potential to cause a ruckus between the country 's leading clubs and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over its timing .
luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .
olsen rings the changes after disappointing world cup coach morten olsen has also left out a number of bundesliga players - daniel jensen of werder bremen , vfl wolfsburg 's thomas kahlenberg , as well as msv duisburg forward soren larsen - but these and other omissions are said to be part of a squad shake-up and not prompted by any pressure from the players ' german clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark ended the world cup without even one win olsen is also leaving out arsenal 's nicklas bendtner and feyenoord 's jon dahl tomasson , while christian poulsen has been allowed to stay behind in italy to continue negotiations on his expected transfer from juventus to liverpool .
with september 's euro 2012 qualifier against iceland in mind , olsen is including world cup players thomas sorensen , lars jacobsen , simon kjaer , daniel agger , per kroldrup , and simon poulsen in his squad to support a host of fringe players and new faces he hopes will give denmark a fighting chance at the euros .
fc utrecht 's michael silberbauer , mads junker of roda jc and nec nijmegen 's lasse schone could gain more experience , while sonderjyske 's johnny thomsen and fc groningen 's nicklas pedersen could make their debuts against germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : germans work to retain control of online personal information generational gap divides opinion on internet privacy merkel 's home to appear on google street view facebook , google use in germany stays high despite privacy inquiries german foreign minister joins criticism of google 's mapping program privacy -pipe- 10.08.2010 google plans to launch street view in germany by end of year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google hopes germany 's 20 largest cities will go on street view in november germany has been particularly critical of google 's street view image capture program .
the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .

"
the comments follow a stern defense of the raid by israel 's prime minister . israeli defense minister ehud barak has told a special israeli commission that a gaza-bound aid flotilla seized in a bloody commando raid in may was a " planned provocation " and that israel had expected a violent dispute weeks in advance .
barak said during discussions going back to april " the image that emerged ... was that the organizations -lsb- behind the flotilla -rsb- were preparing for armed conflict to embarrass israel . "
the former prime minister was the second of three top officials to give sworn testimony before an israeli investigative panel established to examine the legality of the raid that left nine turkish activists dead .
" we regret any loss of life , " barak told the panel .
" but we would have lost more lives if we had behaved differently . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak essentially blamed the deaths on the convoy 's organizers skirmished erupted on the flotilla vessels on may 31 after israeli commandos rappelled aboard in an attempt to stop the ships from breaking a naval blockade of the gaza strip .
activists on board the ships say the troops began firing immediately , whereas military personnel say they were retaliating after being attacked after boarding .
in ' accordance with the law ' on monday , prime minister benjamin netanyhu testified that israel had done nothing wrong .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lsb- israeli defense forces -rsb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid on monday .
the bloodshed was a huge blow to diplomatic relations with turkey and drew sharp rebukes from the international community over the severity of the response to the flotilla by israeli forces .
the un has launched a separate probe into the matter , but israel has made it clear it will not allow the troops involved to be questioned .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : germans work to retain control of online personal information generational gap divides opinion on internet privacy merkel 's home to appear on google street view facebook , google use in germany stays high despite privacy inquiries german foreign minister joins criticism of google 's mapping program privacy -pipe- 10.08.2010 google plans to launch street view in germany by end of year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google hopes germany 's 20 largest cities will go on street view in november germany has been particularly critical of google 's street view image capture program .
the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .

it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 10.08.2010 carers outnumber autoworkers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for care is rising , but despite job increases , germany lacks carers the provision of care for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany employs more people than the country 's automotive industry , a study by an economic research institute has found . the provision of care has become one of the most in-demand services in the german economy , according to a study by wifor , an institute for financial and economic research at the technical university in darmstadt .
the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 10.08.2010 massive ice sheet breaks away from greenland glacier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say this is the largest ice sheet to calve in almost 50 years researchers say a floating ice sheet more than four times the size of new york 's manhattan island could eventually enter shipping lanes or run into oil platforms while drifting south . a giant sheet of ice totaling 260 square kilometers -lrb- 100 square miles -rrb- has broken off an ice shelf in greenland .
while the country has experienced massive glacial loss due to melting in recent decades , experts say it is unclear if this particular glacial event is connected to climate change .
trudy wohlleben , a researcher with the canadian ice service , got quite a surprise when she discovered the gigantic iceberg .
while reviewing nasa satellite images , she noticed that a massive ice island had torn away from petermann 's glacier , on greenland 's northwest coast .
it 's common for glaciers to shed ice - a process called calving - but this size of ice island is rare .
" what 's special about this one is that it is just so much bigger than anything that 's calved recently .
the sheer size .
everyone 's so excited , " wohlleben said in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs can cause problems for shipping routes the enormous sheet of ice is said to be four times the size of manhattan .
" if you are on a ship it would look like a big wall of ice rising out of the ocean .
it is up about five or 10 meters above the water , " wohlleben explained .
the ice sheet is now headed towards the nares strait , a waterway between northern canada and greenland .
scientists are concerned that it may eventually flow right out into the north atlantic .
that would be a big headache for the shipping and oil industries which are based off canada 's east coast .
" there 's a chance larger chunks will come down into shipping lanes and towards the oil platforms , " wohlleben said .
" if they are too big , then towing and waterbomber techniques to break up the iceberg will be much more difficult to apply . "
ice sheet movement unpredictable dr. martin melles , a professor of geology at the university of cologne , explained that 90 percent of the massive ice island is beneath the water .
if it drifts into the ocean , it will be difficult to see and will require monitoring .
he 's confident that modern technology will help avoid serious accidents at sea .
" this is not the time of the titantic .
nowadays , icebergs can be observed by satellites .
or even positioned with a censor so that they can always can be found , even if the weather is bad , " melles said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but melles is concerned that the ice island will run aground .
" according to its geological location and marine currents , it 's expected this iceberg will go southwards to newfoundland and labrador and ultimately end up in the north atlantic , " said melles .
if it strays into shallow water , the geologist said its huge base will likely be lodged for decades before it breaks free again .
" we can not know where this might happen .
it could happen in the shipping lanes , " melles said .
economic deep freeze now shipping and oil industries are keeping close watch on the ice island as it travels through the nares strait .
alexander yusfin works for the shipping company poseidon freighting and believes this glacier could be bad news for his shippers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers track glacial movements in greenland and the arctic " we can not go through if there is big ice .
that 's going to be a big delay .
but it depends on climate and we ca n't control the weather .
these ships carry 6,000 containers .
and if they are stuck , they 're stuck . "
global warming scientists have said global temperatures in the first half of 2010 were the highest on record .
temperatures in large parts of the arctic have risen faster than the global average in recent decades .
but melles says it remains unclear if this particular ice event is actually a result of climate change .
" most of greenland is lost as a result of melting .
with respect to petermann , experts estimate 80 percent is lost by melting and less than 20 percent by calving , " said the geologist .
he added that it is possible that the increased melting may have caused increased calving .
but that is hard to prove , since scientists can not easily access the underside of icebergs .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 10.08.2010 carers outnumber autoworkers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for care is rising , but despite job increases , germany lacks carers the provision of care for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany employs more people than the country 's automotive industry , a study by an economic research institute has found . the provision of care has become one of the most in-demand services in the german economy , according to a study by wifor , an institute for financial and economic research at the technical university in darmstadt .
the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.08.2010 germany shorn of world cup stars for friendly match against denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi loew has used his head and left his stars at home germany 's first match since the world cup has the potential to cause a ruckus between the country 's leading clubs and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over its timing .
luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .
olsen rings the changes after disappointing world cup coach morten olsen has also left out a number of bundesliga players - daniel jensen of werder bremen , vfl wolfsburg 's thomas kahlenberg , as well as msv duisburg forward soren larsen - but these and other omissions are said to be part of a squad shake-up and not prompted by any pressure from the players ' german clubs .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .

" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .
olsen rings the changes after disappointing world cup coach morten olsen has also left out a number of bundesliga players - daniel jensen of werder bremen , vfl wolfsburg 's thomas kahlenberg , as well as msv duisburg forward soren larsen - but these and other omissions are said to be part of a squad shake-up and not prompted by any pressure from the players ' german clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark ended the world cup without even one win olsen is also leaving out arsenal 's nicklas bendtner and feyenoord 's jon dahl tomasson , while christian poulsen has been allowed to stay behind in italy to continue negotiations on his expected transfer from juventus to liverpool .
with september 's euro 2012 qualifier against iceland in mind , olsen is including world cup players thomas sorensen , lars jacobsen , simon kjaer , daniel agger , per kroldrup , and simon poulsen in his squad to support a host of fringe players and new faces he hopes will give denmark a fighting chance at the euros .
fc utrecht 's michael silberbauer , mads junker of roda jc and nec nijmegen 's lasse schone could gain more experience , while sonderjyske 's johnny thomsen and fc groningen 's nicklas pedersen could make their debuts against germany .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.08.2010 german nuclear plants lack protection , ngos say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smokescreen wo n't protect nuclear plants from all hazards germany 's nuclear power plants are surrounded by fences and guarded by security personnel .
but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 10.08.2010 german nuclear plants lack protection , ngos say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a smokescreen wo n't protect nuclear plants from all hazards germany 's nuclear power plants are surrounded by fences and guarded by security personnel .
but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .

however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "

germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .

in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .

"
the comments follow a stern defense of the raid by israel 's prime minister . israeli defense minister ehud barak has told a special israeli commission that a gaza-bound aid flotilla seized in a bloody commando raid in may was a " planned provocation " and that israel had expected a violent dispute weeks in advance .
barak said during discussions going back to april " the image that emerged ... was that the organizations -lsb- behind the flotilla -rsb- were preparing for armed conflict to embarrass israel . "
the former prime minister was the second of three top officials to give sworn testimony before an israeli investigative panel established to examine the legality of the raid that left nine turkish activists dead .
" we regret any loss of life , " barak told the panel .
" but we would have lost more lives if we had behaved differently . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak essentially blamed the deaths on the convoy 's organizers skirmished erupted on the flotilla vessels on may 31 after israeli commandos rappelled aboard in an attempt to stop the ships from breaking a naval blockade of the gaza strip .
activists on board the ships say the troops began firing immediately , whereas military personnel say they were retaliating after being attacked after boarding .
in ' accordance with the law ' on monday , prime minister benjamin netanyhu testified that israel had done nothing wrong .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lsb- israeli defense forces -rsb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid on monday .
the bloodshed was a huge blow to diplomatic relations with turkey and drew sharp rebukes from the international community over the severity of the response to the flotilla by israeli forces .
the un has launched a separate probe into the matter , but israel has made it clear it will not allow the troops involved to be questioned .

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .

although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 10.08.2010 carers outnumber autoworkers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demand for care is rising , but despite job increases , germany lacks carers the provision of care for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany employs more people than the country 's automotive industry , a study by an economic research institute has found . the provision of care has become one of the most in-demand services in the german economy , according to a study by wifor , an institute for financial and economic research at the technical university in darmstadt .
the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .

while the country has experienced massive glacial loss due to melting in recent decades , experts say it is unclear if this particular glacial event is connected to climate change .
trudy wohlleben , a researcher with the canadian ice service , got quite a surprise when she discovered the gigantic iceberg .
while reviewing nasa satellite images , she noticed that a massive ice island had torn away from petermann 's glacier , on greenland 's northwest coast .
it 's common for glaciers to shed ice - a process called calving - but this size of ice island is rare .
" what 's special about this one is that it is just so much bigger than anything that 's calved recently .
the sheer size .
everyone 's so excited , " wohlleben said in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icebergs can cause problems for shipping routes the enormous sheet of ice is said to be four times the size of manhattan .
" if you are on a ship it would look like a big wall of ice rising out of the ocean .
it is up about five or 10 meters above the water , " wohlleben explained .
the ice sheet is now headed towards the nares strait , a waterway between northern canada and greenland .
scientists are concerned that it may eventually flow right out into the north atlantic .
that would be a big headache for the shipping and oil industries which are based off canada 's east coast .
" there 's a chance larger chunks will come down into shipping lanes and towards the oil platforms , " wohlleben said .
" if they are too big , then towing and waterbomber techniques to break up the iceberg will be much more difficult to apply . "
ice sheet movement unpredictable dr. martin melles , a professor of geology at the university of cologne , explained that 90 percent of the massive ice island is beneath the water .
if it drifts into the ocean , it will be difficult to see and will require monitoring .
he 's confident that modern technology will help avoid serious accidents at sea .
" this is not the time of the titantic .
nowadays , icebergs can be observed by satellites .
or even positioned with a censor so that they can always can be found , even if the weather is bad , " melles said in an interview with deutsche welle .
but melles is concerned that the ice island will run aground .
" according to its geological location and marine currents , it 's expected this iceberg will go southwards to newfoundland and labrador and ultimately end up in the north atlantic , " said melles .
if it strays into shallow water , the geologist said its huge base will likely be lodged for decades before it breaks free again .
" we can not know where this might happen .
it could happen in the shipping lanes , " melles said .
economic deep freeze now shipping and oil industries are keeping close watch on the ice island as it travels through the nares strait .
alexander yusfin works for the shipping company poseidon freighting and believes this glacier could be bad news for his shippers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers track glacial movements in greenland and the arctic " we can not go through if there is big ice .
that 's going to be a big delay .
but it depends on climate and we ca n't control the weather .
these ships carry 6,000 containers .
and if they are stuck , they 're stuck . "
global warming scientists have said global temperatures in the first half of 2010 were the highest on record .
temperatures in large parts of the arctic have risen faster than the global average in recent decades .
but melles says it remains unclear if this particular ice event is actually a result of climate change .
" most of greenland is lost as a result of melting .
with respect to petermann , experts estimate 80 percent is lost by melting and less than 20 percent by calving , " said the geologist .
he added that it is possible that the increased melting may have caused increased calving .
but that is hard to prove , since scientists can not easily access the underside of icebergs .

he was in france when floods inundated much of the northwest of pakistan , in what has been called the nation 's worst natural disaster ever . zardari 's critics said he should be in the country in this hour of need and his government was criticized for its weak response to the flooding .

in a bid to do some damage control , the president 's office has indicated that he will visit the disaster-hit areas as soon as possible to get a first-hand understanding of the devastation . on tuesday , two key pakistani television channels claimed that their offices had been shut down by activists of the ruling pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- because they had telecast reports against the president . the managing director of one geo tv , which remained off air in karachi and other parts of sindh province on tuesday , told afp that this was the result of a report about the shoe-throwing incident in birmingham . the government has denied any involvement in the shutdown . massive response needed zardari 's return to pakistan comes as thousands have fled muzaffargarh , a major city in central pakistan , which is threatened by the swollen rivers .
thousands have taken refuge in the nearby city of multan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army hands out relief supplies to survivors of the floods a spokesman for the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in pakistan said that with the latest evacuations " an estimated 14 million people were affected , of which 1.8 million were homeless .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .

" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .
it is not clear , however , whether any of those measures were implemented .
top secret the nuclear power plant operators , major electric companies , the environment ministry 's supervisory bodies and the organization for reactor safety -lrb- grs -rrb- have all remained silent on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear reactors are vulnerable to flames , floods and earthquakes but ngos like international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- and greenpeace have not been as reticent .
both conducted research of their own .
" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites and gps can control airplanes but smokescreens are not very effective , riedl said .
" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

" not one of the german nuclear power plants is protected from a large aircraft crashing into it , " tobias riedl of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" the danger is even more pronounced at older plants , their walls are much thinner , so that even a smaller aircraft crashing could lead to great damage . "
with that in mind , the grs suggested installing a special device in passenger aircraft that would automatically reroute a plane should it drift from its course while approaching a nuclear power plant .
authorities have declined to comment on whether such devices have been installed .
worst-case scenario however , at the philippsburg plant , 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the city of karlsruhe , operators have begun to build a smokescreen that would make the area disappear from view behind thick plumes of smoke within 40 seconds .

" tests have shown that planes can be controlled via gps and satellites , but there is no way you can deactivate the gps coordinates , " he said .
" smokescreen concepts do n't take the problem seriously and would not increase safety . "
henrik paulitz of ippnw said that a plane crash was just one danger ; any kind of fire was a real threat .
" flames that approach a nuclear plant , a fire in a transformer that prompts the disconnection of the reactor from the national grid - all that can lead to the ultimate worst case scenario , " he said . the threat of natural disasters earthquakes can be a problem , too , paulitz said .
the biblis b plant in the state of hesse was not equipped for earthquakes of the magnitude that could occur in the region , he said .
flooding also posed a problem : " that 's a threat because the nuclear power plant might have to be disconnected from the power grid , and that can go wrong , " paulitz said .
the law obliges nuclear power plant operators to upgrade their security measures - but only in so far as the cost and effort are reasonable .
a 1989 grs study says that a major accident in german nuclear power plants can be expected once every 33,000 years .

but ngos say they 're inadequately protected from floods , earthquakes and fire - and possibly also from terrorist attacks by air . germany has 12 nuclear power plants with a total of 17 reactor blocks .
nineteen reactor blocks , many of them built in the early 1960s and 1970s , were shut down because they did not comply with current security standards .
shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the us , the german government pledged to safeguard local nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks , and commissioned a survey in the us on how to protect the plants against plane crashes and armor-piercing weapons .
proposals included fortifying the reactor blocks ' walls with extra thick two-to-three-meter concrete walls , laying out steel nets and installing smokescreens .

in a bid to do some damage control , the president 's office has indicated that he will visit the disaster-hit areas as soon as possible to get a first-hand understanding of the devastation . on tuesday , two key pakistani television channels claimed that their offices had been shut down by activists of the ruling pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- because they had telecast reports against the president . the managing director of one geo tv , which remained off air in karachi and other parts of sindh province on tuesday , told afp that this was the result of a report about the shoe-throwing incident in birmingham . the government has denied any involvement in the shutdown . massive response needed zardari 's return to pakistan comes as thousands have fled muzaffargarh , a major city in central pakistan , which is threatened by the swollen rivers .
thousands have taken refuge in the nearby city of multan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pakistani army hands out relief supplies to survivors of the floods a spokesman for the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in pakistan said that with the latest evacuations " an estimated 14 million people were affected , of which 1.8 million were homeless .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .

along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : germans work to retain control of online personal information generational gap divides opinion on internet privacy merkel 's home to appear on google street view facebook , google use in germany stays high despite privacy inquiries german foreign minister joins criticism of google 's mapping program privacy -pipe- 10.08.2010 google plans to launch street view in germany by end of year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google hopes germany 's 20 largest cities will go on street view in november germany has been particularly critical of google 's street view image capture program .
the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

luckily , joachim loew 's cool head has prevailed . with wednesday 's friendly against denmark in copenhagen coming less than three weeks after the end of the world cup and just over a week before the bundesliga begins , a number of the bundesliga 's most powerful club officials were up in arms about the dfb arranging an international match at the most crucial time in pre-season preparations .
fearing that their top players would be forced to take part in a meaningless game when many had only just returned to full training after their summer exertions in south africa , club bigwigs led by bayern munich 's executive president karl-heinz rummenigge were ready to kick up a stink .
" there is no sense in having international fixtures in august , " rummenigge said recently .
" i hope that as of next season , this fifa august date will no longer exist . "
in an attempt not only to protect the players ahead of the bundesliga start but also to prevent an already combustible argument over club and country loyalties from exploding again , loew has chosen to leave a host of top names out of his squad for the denmark match .
coach loew appeases bundesliga bigwigs bayern stars philipp lahm , bastian schweinsteiger , thomas mueller , miroslav klose , holger badstuber and joerg butt will stay behind with only teammates mario gomez and toni kroos included in the squad .
the werder bremen pair , mesut oezil and per mertesacker , also stay at home .
sami khedira will continue to train with his new club real madrid , while lukas podolski will be allowed to prepare for the new season with cologne , and arne friedrich to stay with wolfsburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerome boateng is one of the eight players selected who were in south africa only eight members of loew 's 18-man squad for the game in copenhagen were in south africa , most of them as unused substitutes .
of those included , only goalkeeper manuel neuer played consistently , while jerome boateng and marko marin saw sporadic action at the world cup .
along with the majority of fringe players , loew also calls up two uncapped players in wolfsburg defender sascha riether and borussia moenchengladbach midfielder marco reus .
" after the world cup and the lengthening of our contracts , it was always going to be the case that we would do without our most established players against denmark , " said loew , whose contract was extended for another two years after he led germany to a third-place finish in south africa .
" we are aware of our responsibility for the form and health of the international players .
so , after the great exertion of the world cup , it is important for them to concentrate on their clubs and preparing well for the new season . "
euro qualifiers scheduled for start of bundesliga season both germany and denmark have their eyes on the first euro 2012 qualifiers , which are scheduled for the first week of september , two weeks after the bundesliga begins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has sough to appease the ' club vs country ' row while bundesliga club officials may have been appeased by their top players being left out of a meaningless friendly , they will still be concerned that international games of consequence will take place so soon in the season .
it is unlikely loew will do without so many of his stars when germany play belgium on september 3 and azerbaijan four days later .
germany , the 2008 finalists , also face turkey , austria and kazakhstan in group a. denmark , who failed to get out of the group stage in south africa , will also be facing germany with a radically changed squad from that which failed to win a game at the world cup .

the study found that the care sector employs more people than germany 's automotive , electrical engineering or mechanical engineering industries .
statistics from 2008 show that some 1.2 million people work as caregivers for the sick , elderly and disabled in germany .
serious shortage looming but the sector is already warning of a serious lack of personnel in coming years , especially as the number of germans relying on either in-home or institutional care is expected to increase dramatically .
a national association of privately employed caregivers , bpa , is warning that by 2020 , the country will have a deficit of some 300,000 carers .
" germany needs a thorough qualification offensive for carers , and a green card scheme for foreign carers , " said bpa president bernd meurer .
he called for the country to gather social services representatives for a conference on the topic of care provision this year .
" continuing to defer this unresolved problem will have terrible consequences for millions of elderly people - something that , in the end , affects us all , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , people in need of care are encouraged to remain in their own homes demographic experts in germany are predicting that the number of people requiring care is set to double by 2050 to over 4 million , as fewer family members are able to care for their sick and elderly relatives and rely on professional caregivers instead .
this is related to several developments : the fact that more women in germany are employed outside the home ; that family members increasingly live further apart ; and that germany 's low birth rate has led to a situation where there are fewer children to care for their elderly parents .
government mulls scheme for immigrants germany 's minister for family affairs kristina schroeder says she 's aware of the pending social crisis due to a shortage of carers and has called for " a clear and practical framework " to bring more qualified caregivers from eastern europe into german households .
germany is not the only eu country facing the dilemma .
frank goodwin , secretary of eurocarers , a dublin-based association for organizations representing caregivers , says it 's a european problem .
" there 's a growing demand for family carers and for formal , paid carers , not only for older people but also people who have heavy dependency needs residing in their homes rather than in institutional care , and that process is happening across many countries in europe , " said goodwin .
he added that as hospitals and nursing homes focus their services on patients with acute treatment needs , more and more unpaid caregivers in private homes are providing quite advanced care - essentially performing a job they would n't be allowed to do in the public sector without proper training .
to this end , governments are also considering schemes to provide training to unpaid caregivers .
goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

the company now plans to let users block pictures of their property before the german site 's year-end launch , but criticism remains . after months of legal wrangling , google expects to make its controversial street view image captures available for germany 's 20 largest cities by the end of the year .
this will include berlin , hamburg , munich , cologne and bonn .
however , the california company is introducing privacy measures unique to germany .
" renters or owners can apply to have their building made unrecognisable before the pictures are published online " starting next week , the company said in a statement on its german website .
the objections can be issued not just by home-owners but also by renters , and even a single objection from a household with multiple members will suffice for image removal .
after the map goes online , users will still have the chance to ask that certain images be blocked , just like in other countries .
the proposal follows more than two years of negotiations and delays on the street view project in germany , including strong criticism from the government and citizens .
questions remain one of the primary critics has been johannes caspar , the hamburg commissioner for data protection .
" i was stunned to hear last thursday that the tool is to be launched from next week , " he said in a statement .
" my concerns about implementing these complex opt-out proceedings were unfortunately not respected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumer minister aigner has called for tough controls on street view however , other government officials , including ilse aigner , germany 's consumer affairs minister , who had previously also been a staunch google critic , applauded the company 's move .
" my demands and the public debate about google publishing information about homes and property on the internet have borne fruit , " her ministry said in a statement .
but caspar remained unconvinced , and also noted that google decided to implement this while many germans are still away on summer vacation , and that the company would not set up a hotline where citizens could ask questions directly of the company .
google spokesperson lena wagner told deutsche welle that caspar 's criticism misses the fact that google has allowed users to opt out of having their houses shown since may 2009 by getting in touch via mail , email or fax .
" the four week period is just for the online tool , which we will release next week , and it is just for the people in the 20 cities where we will launch this year , " wagner said .
regardless of the opt-out policy , other privacy experts agreed with german officials ' concerns .
" i think their concern is justified because there is simply no historical precedent for making this many images available and of providing the world with this much transparency , " said viktor mayer-schoenberger , an austrian professor and the director of the information and innovation policy research center at the national university of singapore .
crime as entertainment mayer-schoenberger also added that street view may have potential applications for thieves or terrorists , who could use the detailed street level maps to plan crimes .
google spokesperson wagner told deutsche welle that the company has yet to see an increase in crime in the regions where the street view function has already been introduced .
but there may be broader problems relating to crime , like what mayer-schoenberger terms the rise of " law enforcement entertainment , " where websites offer people prizes to spot and report crimes committed by others using google 's software .
" this could create a kind of army of citizen vigilantes who have a strong incentive to overreport crimes even though they do n't know the context like local law enforcement personnel , " he told deutsche welle .
thomas hoeren , a law professor at the university of muenster 's institute for information , telecommunication and media law , agrees that street view could lead to vigilantism .
he cited an incident where a california man falsely accused his neighbor of child molestation and publicized the issue using google 's image captures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses are not able to block their offices from street view maps about fear not privacy one way google has tried to limit privacy concerns is by automatically blurring faces and license plate numbers in the pictures it publishes .
users can then report any undisguised faces or numbers missed by the software .
" but the question is whether that goes far enough , " mayer-schoenberger said .
" i 'm still recognizable to those who know me even with a blurred face , but removing people from the images entirely , as some researchers in the us have made possible , creates a false reality . "
although questions related to privacy and data protection have plagued google since it began the street view project in germany , hoeren argues that the root of the controversy has little to do with the surface issues cited .
" behind all of these criticisms here in germany is the fear that google might be too powerful , while being too strange and intransparent , " hoeren told deutsche welle .
" it 's not really about data collection , telecommunications and privacy and such . "
historical precedent germany is famous for having some of the strictest privacy laws in europe , partly due to infringements committed both during the nazi era and by the former communist government in east germany .
today , when organizations and government bodies want to collect data from citizens , a law must be enacted allowing the specific data collection to take place .
data and privacy issues in germany are also complicated by the fact that no single agency is responsible for deciding them .
" instead , each state has its own data practitioner - all it takes is for one data commissioner to object , " said hoeren .
" and that 's a big problem for google . "
nevertheless , the software company expects to release a version of street view germany by november .
but even if german government officials have given google a tough time , the company also noted on its website that many germans are already using google street view .
google said tuesday that one million germans are already using its site daily to view streets in the united states , great britain , italy and france .

goodwin said that ireland , for example , is midway through a program that earmarked 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 790,630 -rrb- to provide training for 8,000-10,000 family caregivers up to mid-2011 .
" those people who complete the training would then be qualified to work as paid carers as well , should they choose , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister kristina schroeder is calling for a better framework for immigrant carers between 1996 and 2008 , germany saw the number of people employed as carers grow by about 50 percent , which translates into a yearly average rise in employment of 3.9 percent , according to information from the wifor institute .
during this same period , the entire german economy registered an average yearly growth of 0.6 percent .
" the sector is hiring six times the number of workers than the economy as a whole , " said the study 's author , dennis ostwald .
the health and social service sector was responsible for almost one in every five jobs created across the eu between 1995 and 2001 .
battling the low-pay image despite those increases , there are still too few trained caregivers .
a 2009 study completed for the european employment observatory noted that public action aimed at encouraging workers ' up-skilling and professionalization of the sector was on the rise everywhere .
" training is indeed necessary to ensure good-quality care and to provide the horizontal and vertical career mobility required to keep workers in the profession , " the paper noted .
however , it went on to say that training policies were not without problems - the most common being that the profession remains a low-pay , low-job quality sector all over europe .
while the flow of cheap , legal caregivers in the wake of eu enlargement is undoubtedly having an effect on care labor markets across europe , the paper 's authors predicted two possible outcomes for germany , a country which already has a sizeable informal market in private carers working without permits .
one is a greater integration of immigrant caregivers on a legal basis ; the other , however , could see the country slide " towards the mediterranean model with its reliance on irregular migrant carers . "

in what was seen as a rare show of unity , hundreds of thousands of colombians staged nationwide protests against kidnapping and the civil conflict in july 2007 , demanding the release of some 3,000 people still being held hostage by different groups .
hopes that an end to the decades-long conflict might be in sight were boosted in 2008 by a series of military successes against the farc rebels , as well as the dramatic freeing of several hostages , including former presidential candidate ingrid betancourt .
alongside politically-motivated blood-letting is drug-related crime , which has become the most common cause of death after cancer and has fuelled kidnapping .
