its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .
the latest incident occurred last saturday , when egyptian police shot dead one sudanese and injured two others attempting to cross the border .
seven more escaped into israel after their smugglers traded gunfire with the border guards .
but johannsen says that though israel 's concern about immigration may be real , the government has other priorities .
" it 's true that the african immigrants are another problem , and this is one of the many ways they try to get north , but i do n't think that is main problem , " she says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2010 new israeli-egyptian border barrier has more than one purpose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite security , the egypt- israel border is often breached the israeli government begins construction on a new security fence along its border with egypt this month .
its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .
the latest incident occurred last saturday , when egyptian police shot dead one sudanese and injured two others attempting to cross the border .
seven more escaped into israel after their smugglers traded gunfire with the border guards .
but johannsen says that though israel 's concern about immigration may be real , the government has other priorities .
" it 's true that the african immigrants are another problem , and this is one of the many ways they try to get north , but i do n't think that is main problem , " she says .
" i think the main problem is the smuggling , and when this border is finally made smuggle proof , that 'll squeeze hamas more and more .
that is really the aim . "
but given the huge cost of the new barrier and the technical and engineering challenge it presents , it could still take years to complete .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2010 new israeli-egyptian border barrier has more than one purpose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite security , the egypt- israel border is often breached the israeli government begins construction on a new security fence along its border with egypt this month .
its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .

but one provocative author came up with a racier way to block a nuclear power law . several hundred protestors have gathered near the gorleben nuclear waste storage facility in northern germany on sunday to demonstrate against plans to extend the period the site can be used as a storage site . hours after the shipment of nuclear waste arrived at gorleben on tuesday , the state government of lower saxony began exploring the possibility of using the former salt mine for longer-term nuclear waste storage . the renewed protests come after demonstrators successfully delayed the shipment of nuclear waste to gorleben from france last week by blocking road and rail routes on the way . french police under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french police engaging protestors is under scrutiny special forces of the french police have come under fire in germany for taking aggressive action against some protestors in germany .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2010 berlusconi agrees to seek confidence vote - after budget debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi could win elections despite a dip in popularity italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has yielded to calls for a no-confidence vote , but only after crucial budget plans have been agreed .
the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .

no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2010 new israeli-egyptian border barrier has more than one purpose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite security , the egypt- israel border is often breached the israeli government begins construction on a new security fence along its border with egypt this month .
its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .
the latest incident occurred last saturday , when egyptian police shot dead one sudanese and injured two others attempting to cross the border .
seven more escaped into israel after their smugglers traded gunfire with the border guards .
but johannsen says that though israel 's concern about immigration may be real , the government has other priorities .
" it 's true that the african immigrants are another problem , and this is one of the many ways they try to get north , but i do n't think that is main problem , " she says .
" i think the main problem is the smuggling , and when this border is finally made smuggle proof , that 'll squeeze hamas more and more .
that is really the aim . "
but given the huge cost of the new barrier and the technical and engineering challenge it presents , it could still take years to complete .

solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .

but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .

blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .

its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .

its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .
the latest incident occurred last saturday , when egyptian police shot dead one sudanese and injured two others attempting to cross the border .
seven more escaped into israel after their smugglers traded gunfire with the border guards .

its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .
the latest incident occurred last saturday , when egyptian police shot dead one sudanese and injured two others attempting to cross the border .
seven more escaped into israel after their smugglers traded gunfire with the border guards .
but johannsen says that though israel 's concern about immigration may be real , the government has other priorities .
" it 's true that the african immigrants are another problem , and this is one of the many ways they try to get north , but i do n't think that is main problem , " she says .
" i think the main problem is the smuggling , and when this border is finally made smuggle proof , that 'll squeeze hamas more and more .
that is really the aim . "
but given the huge cost of the new barrier and the technical and engineering challenge it presents , it could still take years to complete .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy . " she has a central role in the necessary path to national reconciliation and democracy , " westerwelle said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barriers were removed from outside suu kyi 's home on saturday the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino , called for " a democratic transition " to take place in myanmar . " we hope that this act ... is followed by other essential ones : freedom for all political prisoners , an end to all hostility towards ethnic minorities and the launch of a process for national reconciliation , ” fassino said from his website . " it 's now time for myanmar to launch a real democratic transition based on dialogue and the involvement of all parts of society . " french president nicolas sarkozy said that paris would pay close attention to the way suu kyi was treated in the future . " any obstacle to her freedom of movement or expression would constitute a new and unacceptable denial of her rights , " sarkozy said . us president barack obama called suu kyi " a hero of mine . " calls to free other political prisoners while welcoming the news , several world leaders , including un secretary general ban ki-moon , also called on myanmar to release some 2,100 other political prisoners being held by the government . meanwhile , human rights groups reacted cautiously to the release . amnesty international said suu kyi 's release " marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended , and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " new york-based group human rights watch called the junta 's move a " cynical ploy " to deflect criticism of its recent election . author : darren mara , richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

but one provocative author came up with a racier way to block a nuclear power law . several hundred protestors have gathered near the gorleben nuclear waste storage facility in northern germany on sunday to demonstrate against plans to extend the period the site can be used as a storage site . hours after the shipment of nuclear waste arrived at gorleben on tuesday , the state government of lower saxony began exploring the possibility of using the former salt mine for longer-term nuclear waste storage . the renewed protests come after demonstrators successfully delayed the shipment of nuclear waste to gorleben from france last week by blocking road and rail routes on the way . french police under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french police engaging protestors is under scrutiny special forces of the french police have come under fire in germany for taking aggressive action against some protestors in germany .
photos published by german media show uniformed officers of the french crs under direction of german federal police engaging protestors . the german interior ministry has admitted that the french police were involved in confrontations with protesters , but said they were merely helping german police contain an emergency situation . according to an agreement signed in 2008 by several european countries , including france and germany , police may not actively engage in law enforcement across an international border unless an emergency situation exists . racy offer meanwhile , provocative german author charlotte roche has made german president christian wulff a sexual offer should he refuse to sign a law that would extend the life of germany 's nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roche is an adamant critic of nuclear power roche told the german news magazine der spiegel , " i would offer to go to bed with him if he did n't sign it . " wulff has until the end of the year to decide whether to sign into law a proposal by chancellor angela merkel 's government to push back the closure of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
the proposed law has been sent to his office without being voted on by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament that represents the german states . roche added that she had her husband 's approval for the offer and that it was up for the first lady bettina wulff to give her consent . the author took part in last week 's antinuclear protests .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .

" france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .

" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

" center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy .

" calls to free other political prisoners while welcoming the news , several world leaders , including un secretary general ban ki-moon , also called on myanmar to release some 2,100 other political prisoners being held by the government . meanwhile , human rights groups reacted cautiously to the release . amnesty international said suu kyi 's release " marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended , and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy . " she has a central role in the necessary path to national reconciliation and democracy , " westerwelle said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barriers were removed from outside suu kyi 's home on saturday the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino , called for " a democratic transition " to take place in myanmar . " we hope that this act ... is followed by other essential ones : freedom for all political prisoners , an end to all hostility towards ethnic minorities and the launch of a process for national reconciliation , ” fassino said from his website . " it 's now time for myanmar to launch a real democratic transition based on dialogue and the involvement of all parts of society . " french president nicolas sarkozy said that paris would pay close attention to the way suu kyi was treated in the future . " any obstacle to her freedom of movement or expression would constitute a new and unacceptable denial of her rights , " sarkozy said . us president barack obama called suu kyi " a hero of mine . " calls to free other political prisoners while welcoming the news , several world leaders , including un secretary general ban ki-moon , also called on myanmar to release some 2,100 other political prisoners being held by the government . meanwhile , human rights groups reacted cautiously to the release . amnesty international said suu kyi 's release " marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended , and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " new york-based group human rights watch called the junta 's move a " cynical ploy " to deflect criticism of its recent election . author : darren mara , richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .

hunting down animals with packs of dogs was banned in german in 1934 .
but in order to keep the social occasion alive a fitting replacement has been found .
instead of a fox the dogs chase a scent trail through the forests and fields .
the hunters follow the pack on horseback .
the saint hubert 's day hunt at hubertushöhe palace south of berlin marks the highpoint of the hunting season .
it is traditional for ambassadors and emissaries from across the world to take part .
this year the ambassador of kosovo is the honorary field master .
some 80 riders and two packs of dogs take part in the event .
dw reporter georg keller follows the hunt throughout the day , and gets into the saddle himself . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team . germany 's sebastian vettel has become formula one racing 's youngest champion after a win from pole position at the abu dhabi grand prix pushed him to the top of the drivers ' standings . coming into the race , vettel was in third place in the standings behind his red bull teammate mark webber and ferarri 's fernando alonso , who was in first place coming into abu dhabi . but alonso finished seventh and webber finished eighth in abu dhabi , clearing the way for vettel to move to the top of the standings thanks to a flawless race .
alonso finished the season in second place , follow by webber in third and britain 's lewis hamilton in fourth . at 23 years and 134 days old , vettel becomes the youngest formula one champion in history , a distinction previously held by hamilton , who won in 2008 at the age of 23 years and 307 days . schumacher crashes out while vettel celebrated his first formula one world title , his german compatriot michael schumacher - a seven time winner - ended his comeback season on a disappointing note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , left , and liuzzi walked back to the pits together after the crash in the first lap of the race , schumacher spun out and narrowly escaped injury when force india driver vitantonio liuzzi then collided with schumacher and came to rest on top of schumacher 's cockpit . schumacher walked away from the crash and waved to fans after climbing out of the car . the return of schumacher after a three-year hiatus was largely disappointing , as the formula one veteran never finished higher than fourth place for mercedes . however , schumacher 's second half of the season was decidedly better than the first , and the 41-year-old insists he 'll be fighting for the championship next year . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy . " she has a central role in the necessary path to national reconciliation and democracy , " westerwelle said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barriers were removed from outside suu kyi 's home on saturday the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino , called for " a democratic transition " to take place in myanmar .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .

germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy . " she has a central role in the necessary path to national reconciliation and democracy , " westerwelle said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barriers were removed from outside suu kyi 's home on saturday the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino , called for " a democratic transition " to take place in myanmar . " we hope that this act ... is followed by other essential ones : freedom for all political prisoners , an end to all hostility towards ethnic minorities and the launch of a process for national reconciliation , ” fassino said from his website . " it 's now time for myanmar to launch a real democratic transition based on dialogue and the involvement of all parts of society . " french president nicolas sarkozy said that paris would pay close attention to the way suu kyi was treated in the future . " any obstacle to her freedom of movement or expression would constitute a new and unacceptable denial of her rights , " sarkozy said . us president barack obama called suu kyi " a hero of mine . " calls to free other political prisoners while welcoming the news , several world leaders , including un secretary general ban ki-moon , also called on myanmar to release some 2,100 other political prisoners being held by the government . meanwhile , human rights groups reacted cautiously to the release . amnesty international said suu kyi 's release " marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended , and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " new york-based group human rights watch called the junta 's move a " cynical ploy " to deflect criticism of its recent election . author : darren mara , richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

but one provocative author came up with a racier way to block a nuclear power law . several hundred protestors have gathered near the gorleben nuclear waste storage facility in northern germany on sunday to demonstrate against plans to extend the period the site can be used as a storage site . hours after the shipment of nuclear waste arrived at gorleben on tuesday , the state government of lower saxony began exploring the possibility of using the former salt mine for longer-term nuclear waste storage . the renewed protests come after demonstrators successfully delayed the shipment of nuclear waste to gorleben from france last week by blocking road and rail routes on the way . french police under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french police engaging protestors is under scrutiny special forces of the french police have come under fire in germany for taking aggressive action against some protestors in germany .
photos published by german media show uniformed officers of the french crs under direction of german federal police engaging protestors . the german interior ministry has admitted that the french police were involved in confrontations with protesters , but said they were merely helping german police contain an emergency situation . according to an agreement signed in 2008 by several european countries , including france and germany , police may not actively engage in law enforcement across an international border unless an emergency situation exists . racy offer meanwhile , provocative german author charlotte roche has made german president christian wulff a sexual offer should he refuse to sign a law that would extend the life of germany 's nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roche is an adamant critic of nuclear power roche told the german news magazine der spiegel , " i would offer to go to bed with him if he did n't sign it . " wulff has until the end of the year to decide whether to sign into law a proposal by chancellor angela merkel 's government to push back the closure of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
the proposed law has been sent to his office without being voted on by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament that represents the german states . roche added that she had her husband 's approval for the offer and that it was up for the first lady bettina wulff to give her consent . the author took part in last week 's antinuclear protests .

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy . " she has a central role in the necessary path to national reconciliation and democracy , " westerwelle said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barriers were removed from outside suu kyi 's home on saturday the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino , called for " a democratic transition " to take place in myanmar . " we hope that this act ... is followed by other essential ones : freedom for all political prisoners , an end to all hostility towards ethnic minorities and the launch of a process for national reconciliation , ” fassino said from his website . " it 's now time for myanmar to launch a real democratic transition based on dialogue and the involvement of all parts of society . " french president nicolas sarkozy said that paris would pay close attention to the way suu kyi was treated in the future . " any obstacle to her freedom of movement or expression would constitute a new and unacceptable denial of her rights , " sarkozy said . us president barack obama called suu kyi " a hero of mine . " calls to free other political prisoners while welcoming the news , several world leaders , including un secretary general ban ki-moon , also called on myanmar to release some 2,100 other political prisoners being held by the government . meanwhile , human rights groups reacted cautiously to the release . amnesty international said suu kyi 's release " marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended , and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " new york-based group human rights watch called the junta 's move a " cynical ploy " to deflect criticism of its recent election . author : darren mara , richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .

the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .

of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .

the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2010 berlusconi agrees to seek confidence vote - after budget debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi could win elections despite a dip in popularity italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has yielded to calls for a no-confidence vote , but only after crucial budget plans have been agreed .
the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team . germany 's sebastian vettel has become formula one racing 's youngest champion after a win from pole position at the abu dhabi grand prix pushed him to the top of the drivers ' standings . coming into the race , vettel was in third place in the standings behind his red bull teammate mark webber and ferarri 's fernando alonso , who was in first place coming into abu dhabi . but alonso finished seventh and webber finished eighth in abu dhabi , clearing the way for vettel to move to the top of the standings thanks to a flawless race .
alonso finished the season in second place , follow by webber in third and britain 's lewis hamilton in fourth . at 23 years and 134 days old , vettel becomes the youngest formula one champion in history , a distinction previously held by hamilton , who won in 2008 at the age of 23 years and 307 days . schumacher crashes out while vettel celebrated his first formula one world title , his german compatriot michael schumacher - a seven time winner - ended his comeback season on a disappointing note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , left , and liuzzi walked back to the pits together after the crash in the first lap of the race , schumacher spun out and narrowly escaped injury when force india driver vitantonio liuzzi then collided with schumacher and came to rest on top of schumacher 's cockpit . schumacher walked away from the crash and waved to fans after climbing out of the car . the return of schumacher after a three-year hiatus was largely disappointing , as the formula one veteran never finished higher than fourth place for mercedes . however , schumacher 's second half of the season was decidedly better than the first , and the 41-year-old insists he 'll be fighting for the championship next year . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team . germany 's sebastian vettel has become formula one racing 's youngest champion after a win from pole position at the abu dhabi grand prix pushed him to the top of the drivers ' standings . coming into the race , vettel was in third place in the standings behind his red bull teammate mark webber and ferarri 's fernando alonso , who was in first place coming into abu dhabi . but alonso finished seventh and webber finished eighth in abu dhabi , clearing the way for vettel to move to the top of the standings thanks to a flawless race .
alonso finished the season in second place , follow by webber in third and britain 's lewis hamilton in fourth . at 23 years and 134 days old , vettel becomes the youngest formula one champion in history , a distinction previously held by hamilton , who won in 2008 at the age of 23 years and 307 days . schumacher crashes out while vettel celebrated his first formula one world title , his german compatriot michael schumacher - a seven time winner - ended his comeback season on a disappointing note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , left , and liuzzi walked back to the pits together after the crash in the first lap of the race , schumacher spun out and narrowly escaped injury when force india driver vitantonio liuzzi then collided with schumacher and came to rest on top of schumacher 's cockpit . schumacher walked away from the crash and waved to fans after climbing out of the car . the return of schumacher after a three-year hiatus was largely disappointing , as the formula one veteran never finished higher than fourth place for mercedes . however , schumacher 's second half of the season was decidedly better than the first , and the 41-year-old insists he 'll be fighting for the championship next year . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

however , the future of democracy in the country still looks bleak , says dw ’ s sybille golte . the people of myanmar have been waiting years for this moment .
in the final hours before the release of aung san suu kyi was announced , supporters gathered in front of her modest house in the city of rangoon .
an entire people 's hopes for freedom , justice and democracy rest with the nobel peace prize winner .
suu kyi has dedicated her life to those values .
open and ready to talk - yet unyielding in her attitude - she defied the dictatorship for years and paid for it with her freedom .
now , she is finally free .
but does that mean that democracy in myanmar has now become a possibility ?
hardly .
if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .
also , the modifier " in the long term " was added to the sentence , " in demographic terms , the enormous fertility of muslim immigrants poses a threat to the equilibrium of culture and civilization in an ageing europe . "
the changes slightly soften some of the statements that had especially upset spokesmen for the islamic community .
in august , sarrazin said muslim culture posed a threat to european societies , telling reporters that germans were in danger of becoming " strangers in their own country . "
germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has begun proceedings to expel sarrazin , who came to prominence as a finance minister of the state of berlin .
sarrazin also previously served as a board member with germany 's central bank but was suspended over his remarks .
he has denied racism or right-wing views , but has admitted he is worried that the book might encourage those views .
the book , which urges german leaders to step up scrutiny of potential immigrants to the country , sparked a furious round of public debate centered on government integration policies .

the perfectly executed race caps a successful season for vettel and his red bull team . germany 's sebastian vettel has become formula one racing 's youngest champion after a win from pole position at the abu dhabi grand prix pushed him to the top of the drivers ' standings . coming into the race , vettel was in third place in the standings behind his red bull teammate mark webber and ferarri 's fernando alonso , who was in first place coming into abu dhabi . but alonso finished seventh and webber finished eighth in abu dhabi , clearing the way for vettel to move to the top of the standings thanks to a flawless race .
alonso finished the season in second place , follow by webber in third and britain 's lewis hamilton in fourth . at 23 years and 134 days old , vettel becomes the youngest formula one champion in history , a distinction previously held by hamilton , who won in 2008 at the age of 23 years and 307 days . schumacher crashes out while vettel celebrated his first formula one world title , his german compatriot michael schumacher - a seven time winner - ended his comeback season on a disappointing note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher , left , and liuzzi walked back to the pits together after the crash in the first lap of the race , schumacher spun out and narrowly escaped injury when force india driver vitantonio liuzzi then collided with schumacher and came to rest on top of schumacher 's cockpit . schumacher walked away from the crash and waved to fans after climbing out of the car . the return of schumacher after a three-year hiatus was largely disappointing , as the formula one veteran never finished higher than fourth place for mercedes . however , schumacher 's second half of the season was decidedly better than the first , and the 41-year-old insists he 'll be fighting for the championship next year . author : matt zuvela -lrb- reuters , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the ruling junta of generals had democracy in mind , then some sign of it would have been seen in last weekend 's elections .
the opposite was the case .
the ballot was a farce .
it was nothing more than a fig leaf for the continued dictatorial rule of the generals .
the dispute over this badly staged public-relations show remains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi 's release is a calculated risk on the part of the generals , says golte it is obvious that aung san suu kyi 's release is just an act meant to symbolize the regime 's supposed openness to the rest of the world .
the generals are entirely free to once again imprison the opposition leader under some pretext , if her presence becomes uncomfortable for them .
that is something that has happened many times in the past .
of course , the release of such a symbolic figure does pose a certain risk for the country 's rulers - but this is a calculated risk .
if it does come to a popular uprising , there are tried and tested methods of dealing with this .
the generals can always set the tanks in motion , as they did during the uprising started by buddhist monks three years ago .
natural disasters , famine and poverty still dominate the lives of its people , despite the country 's abundance of natural resources .
that is of little consequence to the generals , as are the repeated protests made by human rights organizations and the united nations .
numerous mediation attempts and diplomatic offensives have borne little fruit .
the power of the generals is based not only on their tanks but also on friends in high places , upon whom they have always been able to rely . for a start , there is myanmar 's neighbor china , which gives cover to the generals .
even india always puts its economic interests in myanmar 's natural resources ahead of a push for democratic values .
the asean organization of south east asian states , to which myanmar belongs , also holds back from criticism .
that would mean setting standards for the other members of the alliance .
aung san suu kyi is free , but democracy in myanmar remains captive to the military .
one has to fear that the unwavering nobel peace prize winner may soon share that fate once again .

13 .
myanmar 's newly freed pro-democracy icon , who had been incarcerated by the country ’ s regime for 15 of the past 21 years , gave her first speech in seven years just one day after being released , calling on a crowd of supporters in yangon to unite . myanmar 's opposition is in disarray , a situation highlighted by last week ’ s controversial election that consolidated the country ’ s junta 's decades-long grip on power . the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , suu kyi 's party , refused to take part in the election and was consequently outlawed by the regime .
this move apparently deepened the rifts within the party as some members ignored the boycott to stand in the vote that democracy activists and western leaders labelled as a sham . suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen condemnation of the elections . the last elections were in 1990 , when the military refused to relinquish power despite the nld winning 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . " i want to work with all democratic forces , " she told her supporters on sunday , saying she wanted to " hear the voice of the people " before deciding her course of action . she did reveal that she would be meeting with foreign diplomats in the near future and that western sanctions imposed on myanmar in relation to the junta 's repression and her own treatment would be on the agenda . in long-awaited remarks , suu kyi said that the " basis of democratic freedom is freedom of speech . " " democracy is when the people keep a government in check , " suu kyi told the crowd at the nld 's headquarters . the crowd , many of them waving " we love suu " placards , cheered the nobel peace laureate and called her " mother " or " sister . "
no security personnel were visible on the streets , but soldiers were seen in a building opposite nld headquarters .
" i don ’ t have any antagonism toward the people who kept me under house arrest … the security officials treated me well , " she added .
" i want to ask -lsb- the junta -rsb- to treat the people well also . " " please do not give up hope , there is no reason to lose heart , " she said . global focus shifts to myanmar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crowd of supporters gathered outside suu kyi 's home the international community has used suu kyi ’ s release as an opportunity to urge the country 's ruling military dictatorship to hold free elections and to warn against any new infringement of suu kyi 's liberties . german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister guido westerwelle expressed their hopes that suu kyi would be able to work for democracy .

one former french political heavyweight received a minister post . following the resignation of french prime minister francois fillon 's administration on saturday , fillon unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on sunday .
he was put back in his post as prime minister by president nicolas sarkozy earlier in the day . the new government is slightly more in line with sarkozy 's political direction and features appointees loyal to sarkozy and fellow members of the union for a popular movement party .
there are 31 ministers in the new team , compared with 37 before . the move had been expected after sarkozy announced in june that he would appoint a new cabinet once a controversial pension reform raising the country 's minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 was passed .
following weeks of strikes and protests , that reform was signed into law last week . sarkozy reappointed fillon to his post as prime minister earlier in the day on sunday .
while many of the resigned cabinet members were brought back in the shake-up , some new faces have shifted the cabinet slightly to the right . gathering allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has seen his approval rating drop finance minister christine lagarde and interior minister brice hortefeux remained in their former jobs , but foreign minister bernard kouchner was replaced by former justice minister michele alliot-marie . as the life partner of the new junior minister in charge of parliamentary relations , patrick ollier , alliot-marie made history for the fifth republic as half of the first couple to serve as ministers in the same government . meanwhile , speculation that former french prime minister and current mayor of bordeaux , alain juppe , would become defense minister replacing herve morin was also confirmed . " france needs pluralism , and democracy needs balance , " said morin , who is considering running against sarkozy in 2012 .
" since april 2010 the head of state has not agreed with this proposition , and so for my part i ca n't remain in government . " center-right environment minister jean-louis borloo - the number two figure in the outgoing government and until recently a frontrunner for the prime minister 's office - announced he was stepping down . observers consider the new cabinet a political maneuver to put sarkozy in a better position for re-election in 2012 , although he has not yet declared that he will be running . sarkozy 's ratings in france have taken a plunge due to the unpopular pension reforms . critics in the opposition opposition socialist party leader martine aubry criticized the new cabinet , saying sarkozy did not implement the political change the french people want . " the president has brought back the same prime minister to carry on the same politics , " aubry said in a statement .
" mr. sarkozy announced this reshuffle six months ago .
since then , the ministers have been more interested in the future of their posts than the future of the french people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2010 berlusconi agrees to seek confidence vote - after budget debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi could win elections despite a dip in popularity italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has yielded to calls for a no-confidence vote , but only after crucial budget plans have been agreed .
the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .
berlusconi said he would test his support in italy 's upper house , the senate , and the lower chamber of deputies only " after the definite approval of the budget . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini , left , was expelled from the party he co-founded with berlusconi the move is being seen as an effort by the 74-year-old to regain the political initiative after a difficult few months for his government .
berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .
members of government set to resign four members of the fragile government who are loyal to fini are expected to step down on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have taken to the street to call for berlusconi 's resignation fini , whose future and freedom for italy -lrb- fli -rrb- party voted against a berlusconi immigration bill last week , has now joined leaders of other political parties in calling for berlusconi to resign .
the demands follow the latest in a long-running series of sex-scandal allegations .
the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .
popular calls for berlusconi 's resignation have led to demonstrations in the streets , including two " no berlusconi " days , one in october and the other in december last year . richard connor -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mohamed aden tiicey , a senior official in adado , told reuters the chandlers were handed over early sunday after an undisclosed sum was paid as ransom .
" the chandlers are with me now .
they are free and safe , " he said .
pirates had kidnapped retirees paul and rachel chandler on october 23 last year after hijacking their 38-foot yacht in the indian ocean off the seychelles .
" i 'm fine , thank you , enjoying being free , but we are still in somalia , " rachel chandler told the reuters news agency by telephone after her release .
" we are with the good guys now .
we will be making our way to nairobi later in the day today . "
" no , we were not well treated , " she added .
abdi mohamed helmi hangul , a somali surgeon who was instrumental in the chandlers ' release , told the afp news agency that the couple looked " in relatively good health but they need to be checked . "
" security is huge here , inside and outside the compound , nothing can happen to them now , " he added .
the chandlers , who hail from kent in southeast england , were provided with cell phones to call relatives and loved ones , and will now make their way back home .
piracy in waters off somalia has spiked in recent years , with pirates usually targeting commercial shipping vessels in order to demand multi-million-dollar ransoms .
the british government has a strict policy of not paying any ransoms .
but a local elder in the region told afp on saturday that the pirates had agreed to free the chandlers following the payment of 320,000 dollars on top of 400,000 dollars already received during an aborted release attempt earlier this year .

" former central banker thilo sarrazin , who caused a storm in germany in august with a controversial book on immigrant integration , has toned down the rhetoric in his treatise .
german weekly newspaper welt am sonntag reported sunday that a key line in sarrazin 's book , titled " germany is doing away with itself , " has been removed from the 14th edition .
the sentence claimed that migrants from the middle east were a " genetic minus " for germany .

the move is seen as a bid by the premier to regain the political initiative . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has said he will agree to a no-confidence vote sought by political rivals - but that next year 's budget will have to be passed first .

berlusconi 's office said on saturday that there was an " undeniable necessity " to approve the 2011 budget to ensure greater economic stability amid turbulence on the financial markets .
the government then " intends to verify its continued confidence in the senate and , immediately after , in the chamber of deputies , " a statement said .
motion already in place the move comes after the country 's largest opposition party pushed forward with plans for a vote against berlusconi 's government .
a no-confidence motion , for which no date has yet been set , was submitted on friday by the leader of the democratic party dario franceschini with support from the anti-corruption party idv .
the budget debate is due to begin on thursday .
berlusconi 's government has been in a precarious state since he expelled lower house speaker gianfranco fini from the people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party that both men co-founded in 2008 .
fini set up his own center-right party , bringing supporters from the chamber with him and depriving berlusconi - now in his third term as premier- of a guaranteed majority .

the premier has so far refused to step down and has said he is determined to remain in power until the end of the parliamentary term in 2013 .
by demanding that the vote in the senate , where he still has a majority , the premier may be hoping to regain the political initiative and make his removal in the lower house more difficult .
differing confidence votes in the two chambers could make it necessary for fresh elections to be called , which opinion polls say berlusconi is likely to win - despite a significant dip in his popularity among the electorate .

its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
" i want to see tangible results regarding the start of work on the ground barrier within the coming weeks . "
solving two problems gershon baskin , co-ceo of the israel / palestine center for research and information , says that a large majority of israelis support the new construction .
" most israelis are very supportive of it , because we have a problem here that no-one knows how to deal with , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have estimations that 15,000 people cross the border every year , and some people think that that number will double in the following years if the fence is not constructed . "
baskin insists that this is a very different kind of fence to the huge concrete and steel barrier being erected in the west bank .
" it 's a totally different situation , " he said .
" the wall being built between the israelis and the palestinians is aimed at preventing suicide bombers getting into israel , though some people view it as a land-grab . "
but while baskin describes the sinai boundary as " a very , very quiet border in terms of security issues , " others point out that it is often used by the military wing of hamas to smuggle weapons into israel .
margret johannsen , reasearcher at the institute for peace research and security policy in hamburg , says , " hamas really has something to fear from the barrier . "
this is obviously another reason for the massive investment .
mutual enemy for its part , egypt has said that israel 's construction is its own business .
" this issue does not concern us at all , " egypt 's foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit said in january , when plans for the new construction were first announced .
" israel is building something on its own soil and there is no link between that security fence and our construction along the border with gaza . "
but this affected apathy belies what many believe is the active interest that egypt also has in controlling the border .
" hamas is a mutual enemy of israel and egypt , " johannsen told deutsche welle .
" hamas is founded in the muslim brotherhood , which questions the legitimacy of the egyptian regime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a vast network of tunnels under the egypt-gaza border " the problem is the egyptian government practices a certain see-saw policy towards the muslim brotherhood , " she added .
" the brotherhood is officially illegal , and can not stand in elections , but it enjoys popular support among the egyptian people , who see hamas as a david fighting goliath . "
blurred issues the egyptian government is therefore forced to balance its people 's support for hamas with western and israeli pressure to control the border .
while for israelis the issues of illegal immigration and security may be totally separate , at the sinai border they become difficult to distinguish , especially for border guards .
palestinians dug thousands of tunnels to smuggle goods , fuel and weapons from egypt to the gaza strip after israel imposed a tight blockade on the territory more than two years ago .
but many african migrants also pay the smugglers for passage into israel to escape poverty and humanitarian crises and look for work .
the tunnel network continues to flourish , despite the underground steel wall that egypt has built along its border with gaza .
dozens of these tunnels are routinely discovered and destroyed by both egyptian and israeli authorities , but others are cut all the time .
on top of this , egyptian border guards shoot at the african migrants , and many have been killed .
the latest incident occurred last saturday , when egyptian police shot dead one sudanese and injured two others attempting to cross the border .
seven more escaped into israel after their smugglers traded gunfire with the border guards .
but johannsen says that though israel 's concern about immigration may be real , the government has other priorities .
" it 's true that the african immigrants are another problem , and this is one of the many ways they try to get north , but i do n't think that is main problem , " she says .
" i think the main problem is the smuggling , and when this border is finally made smuggle proof , that 'll squeeze hamas more and more .
that is really the aim . "
but given the huge cost of the new barrier and the technical and engineering challenge it presents , it could still take years to complete .

its main purpose is to counter illegal immigration , but there are serious implications for the mideast conflict . prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced last week that israel is about to begin building a high-tech barrier along its 266-kilometer sinai border with egypt .
the fence is expected to cost some 1.35 billion shekels -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- and will comprise a host of high-tech elements including radar .
once the barrier is completed , israel will be almost entirely fenced in , since the country already has heavily-patrolled fences along its international borders with lebanon , syria and jordan , and is in the process of building a wall within its own borders to separate israel from the palestinian territories .
but this new fence is ostensibly different to the others .
the israel-egypt border has become a major transit route for economic migrants , asylum-seekers and drug smugglers , and some estimates suggest that over 1,000 people are crossing the border into israel every month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu expects construction to begin within weeks " the problem of illegal infiltrators along the south-western border is a threat to the jewish and democratic character of the state of israel , " netanyahu said in a statement .
