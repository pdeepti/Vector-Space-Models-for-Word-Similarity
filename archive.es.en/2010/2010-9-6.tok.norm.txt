the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .

willy bogner , a former olympic skier , will be replaced by his deputy , bernhard schwank . willy bogner was forced to resign on monday from his position as head of munich 's bid committee for the 2018 winter olympics after less than 10 months on the job .
bogner said health problems had forced him to step down .
the bid committee made the announcement in a statement , one week after the 68-year-old former skier , fashion designer and filmmaker said he was suffering from diverticulitis , a digestive disease mainly found in the large intestine .
" my illness is more serious than originally believed , " bogner , who took charge of the committee last november , explained in monday 's statement .
" i will continue to support our bid … we stand a great chance , and i hope that my dream of olympics and paralympics in my home area becomes a reality . "
bogner 's deputy , bernhard schwank , has been promoted from the role of managing director to the new munich olympics bid committee chief .
katarina witt , the double olympic figure skating champion , has been appointed presenter of the munich campaign , while bogner will remain part of the team , taking a position on the supervisory board .
another setback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bogner skied for germany in 1960 and 1964 munich 's bid to secure the 2018 winter olympics has hardly enjoyed a smooth start .
richard adam , the bid committee 's first managing director , had to leave his post in march , allegedly because of internal friction with bogner .
july was also a turbulent month for the would-be organizers , as they fought protests from local communities unwilling to host various events and tried to secure an increased budget to fund the campaign .
" we had hoped for a little bit more , " bogner admitted when the budget was increased to 33 million euros -lrb- $ 42.5 million -rrb- on july 15 , amid rumors that he had threatened to resign from his post over the issue .
even the state premier of bavaria , horst seehofer , was compelled to jump into the debate , describing the various problems as " not conducive " to the olympic bid .
munich is competing against pyeongchang , south korea and the french resort of annecy for the games .
the international olympic committee will reveal the winning bid on july 6 , 2011 , at a planned session in durban , south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.09.2010 politicians could learn from beethoven , says festival head ilona schmiel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel says beethoven inspires enthusiasm utopia , freedom and international exchange are at the core of this year 's beethovenfest .
beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "

" this is particularly important to avoid exacerbating the chilling effect on belorussian media that questions over his death would have , " the osce 's media freedom representative , dunja mijatovic said in a statement praising bebenin 's charter97 website as " one of a few non-governmental sources of information " in belarus .
television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food .

another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.09.2010 german court rules against youtube in copyright row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube has vowed to fight the ruling internet giant google has suffered a setback after a german court ruled that its subsidiary , youtube , is responsible for videos its users upload in violation of copyright law . a hamburg court ruled on friday that youtube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted material without permission .
the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.09.2010 german court rules against youtube in copyright row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube has vowed to fight the ruling internet giant google has suffered a setback after a german court ruled that its subsidiary , youtube , is responsible for videos its users upload in violation of copyright law . a hamburg court ruled on friday that youtube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted material without permission .
the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 06.09.2010 mourners question death of belarus journalist at funeral großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bebenin 's outspoken views often landed him in trouble oleg bebenin 's friends and colleagues mourned his passing at monday 's funeral and said they could n't believe that the 36-year-old journalist and family man killed himself .
bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "
international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' hardline president has virtually stifled the free press the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the european parliament have called for an independent investigation into bebenin 's death .
" this is particularly important to avoid exacerbating the chilling effect on belorussian media that questions over his death would have , " the osce 's media freedom representative , dunja mijatovic said in a statement praising bebenin 's charter97 website as " one of a few non-governmental sources of information " in belarus .
television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "

in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

willy bogner , a former olympic skier , will be replaced by his deputy , bernhard schwank . willy bogner was forced to resign on monday from his position as head of munich 's bid committee for the 2018 winter olympics after less than 10 months on the job .
bogner said health problems had forced him to step down .
the bid committee made the announcement in a statement , one week after the 68-year-old former skier , fashion designer and filmmaker said he was suffering from diverticulitis , a digestive disease mainly found in the large intestine .
" my illness is more serious than originally believed , " bogner , who took charge of the committee last november , explained in monday 's statement .
" i will continue to support our bid … we stand a great chance , and i hope that my dream of olympics and paralympics in my home area becomes a reality . "
bogner 's deputy , bernhard schwank , has been promoted from the role of managing director to the new munich olympics bid committee chief .

july was also a turbulent month for the would-be organizers , as they fought protests from local communities unwilling to host various events and tried to secure an increased budget to fund the campaign .
" we had hoped for a little bit more , " bogner admitted when the budget was increased to 33 million euros -lrb- $ 42.5 million -rrb- on july 15 , amid rumors that he had threatened to resign from his post over the issue .
even the state premier of bavaria , horst seehofer , was compelled to jump into the debate , describing the various problems as " not conducive " to the olympic bid .
munich is competing against pyeongchang , south korea and the french resort of annecy for the games .
the international olympic committee will reveal the winning bid on july 6 , 2011 , at a planned session in durban , south africa .

bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "

television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "

television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

willy bogner , a former olympic skier , will be replaced by his deputy , bernhard schwank . willy bogner was forced to resign on monday from his position as head of munich 's bid committee for the 2018 winter olympics after less than 10 months on the job .
bogner said health problems had forced him to step down .
the bid committee made the announcement in a statement , one week after the 68-year-old former skier , fashion designer and filmmaker said he was suffering from diverticulitis , a digestive disease mainly found in the large intestine .
" my illness is more serious than originally believed , " bogner , who took charge of the committee last november , explained in monday 's statement .
" i will continue to support our bid … we stand a great chance , and i hope that my dream of olympics and paralympics in my home area becomes a reality . "
bogner 's deputy , bernhard schwank , has been promoted from the role of managing director to the new munich olympics bid committee chief .

july was also a turbulent month for the would-be organizers , as they fought protests from local communities unwilling to host various events and tried to secure an increased budget to fund the campaign .
" we had hoped for a little bit more , " bogner admitted when the budget was increased to 33 million euros -lrb- $ 42.5 million -rrb- on july 15 , amid rumors that he had threatened to resign from his post over the issue .
even the state premier of bavaria , horst seehofer , was compelled to jump into the debate , describing the various problems as " not conducive " to the olympic bid .

but as the polar ice cap melts , external powers have expressed an interest in the energy-rich region , raising eyebrows among the arctic nations . as the arctic circle undergoes its perennial summer thaw , a series of expeditions have set sail for the high north .
russia recently sent its largest expedition in a decade while the us and canada are conducting a joint mission in the beaufort sea .
these expeditions often wear a facade of scientific inquiry , but their findings could have sweeping political implications .
the arctic powers are mapping the seabed so they can back up their competing territorial claims in the region .
territory is not the only thing at stake .
abundant resources also lie in the depths of the arctic ocean .
as the globe warms and arctic ice melts , a fortune in oil and gas could become accessible .
the us geological survey has reported that 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas sits in the arctic ocean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia planted its flag in the arctic seabed in 2007 global warming means new trade routes are also opening in the high north .
the northwest passage , which connects the atlantic and pacific oceans via arctic canada , became navigable in 2007 .
and the northeast passage , which connects europe to asia across northern russia , has also become easier to traverse .
as a result , governance in the arctic has become more than a regional power game .
it has far-reaching political and economic implications for a globalized world , and non-arctic nations are beginning to take note . usual suspects " this is n't the 15th century .
you ca n't go around the world and just plant flags and say ' we 're claiming this territory ' , " said peter mackay - at the time canada 's foreign minister - in august 2007 . a russian expedition had just set a titanium , rust-proof flag in the north pole 's seabed .
members of the expedition compared the flag planting to the us moon landing in 1969 , saying it marked a scientific , rather than political , achievement .
but other nations saw a russian attempt to prematurely claim the abundant resources that lie trapped under the arctic 's receding ice .
now canada , denmark , norway and the us have begun to stake out their piece of the arctic pie as well .
maritime claims are governed by the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the treaty allows nations exclusive economic access to an area that stretches 200 nautical miles from their coastlines .
this area can be expanded to 350 nautical miles if a geographic connection to the mainland can be proven .
energy and trade are at stake so expeditions are crisscrossing the arctic , looking for geographic evidence that will support their claims before an international tribunal .
for instance , russia says the lomonosov ridge , which lies under the arctic ocean , is a natural extension of its territory .
most of the energy resources lie within the arctic powers ' current exclusive economic areas .
this means that territorial claims will not necessarily bring more riches in oil and gas .
but the potential for additional unclaimed resources to be found has whetted the appetite for territorial expansion .
beyond the search for energy , the management of newly accessible shipping routes could change the geography of international trade .
the us and canada dispute the status of the northwest passage .
canada claims that it has sovereignty over the potentially lucrative trade route , while the us believes it lies in international waters .
" in a way the -lsb- canadian -rsb- government has harped on the sovereignty theme to the exclusion of others as they 've tried to broach the international dimensions of canada 's interests in the north , " franklyn griffiths , an expert on arctic politics and professor emeritus of political science at the university of toronto , told deutsche welle .
" sovereignty is the big thing . "
new contender : china the opening of new trade routes has implications for the entire world , not just the high north .
china has no geographic connection to arctic circle .
but as the world 's top exporter , it has a major stake in international trade .
currently , chinese products have to travel through dangerous choke points on their route to global markets .
chinese vessels must first navigate through the straits of malacca , which connects the pacific and indian oceans .
once this hurdle has been passed , ships then have to pass the horn of africa on their way toward the suez canal .
this route is vulnerable to piracy , particularly off the coast of somalia .
the opening of the northeast passage across russia 's northern coast would reduce the trip from beijing to hamburg by 6,400 kilometers -lrb- 4,000 miles -rrb- and allow chinese vessels to bypass the traditional voyage through malacca and the suez .
bildunterschrift : the arctic powers could use their territorial claims to create spheres of influence " i think china is interested in the arctic for the same reason as other non-polar states have also become interested , " linda jakobson , director of the stockholm international peace research institute 's program on china and global security , told deutsche welle .
" china 's economic development is to a large extent dependent on foreign trade , and china 's foreign trade is heavily dependent on shipping .
anything that offers china new trade routes is of interest to china . "
a chinese vessel set sail for the arctic this summer to conduct research .
and a russian tanker recently undertook the treacherous journey across the northeast passage to deliver gas condensate in china .
as beijing 's interests in the region grow , it is taking care not to upset the regional power balance .
respect for territorial integrity is a hallmark of chinese foreign policy , and officials in beijing have made it clear that they will respect the arctic powers ' sovereignty .

" china would very much like to see non-arctic states being a part of the process . "
arctic land grab ?
the five major arctic powers declared in 2008 that they will use current international arrangements to govern the arctic region .
this means that territorial disputes will be resolved through the law of the sea , and regional dialogue will take place within the arctic council , a multilateral forum that manages development and environmental issues in the high north .
but this arrangement could preclude non-arctic states from voicing their developing interests in the region .
china can only participate in the arctic council on an ad-hoc basis , which means it has to apply to participate in each meeting .
the chinese have submitted an application for permanent observer status , but as yet the council has not made a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new trade routes could greatly impact china with non-arctic states like china currently playing a marginal role , the five arctic powers could establish spheres of influence in the region before the international community is able to gain a foothold .
" time and again there have been historical attempts by the bordering states to create sovereignty or spheres of influence in the arctic , " ruediger wolfrum , an expert on the law of the sea and director of the max planck institute for comparative public law and international law , told deutsche welle .
he proposes an international conference , in which non-arctic states have participation rights , to create a global consensus before disputes grow in number .
griffiths advocates the expansion of canadian arctic policy beyond sovereignty issues and supports a greater role for non-arctic states .
but at the same time , he encourages these states to participate more in existing institutions .
" they should get involved and contribute to the working groups of the arctic council and show good faith and what they have to offer instead of whining about not being included in the arctic council as full and equal members , " he said . author : spencer kimball editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 06.09.2010 misapprehensions abound ahead of euro 2012 in poland and ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro 2012 is coming to eastern europe one host country wo n't be ready for the tournament , and foreigners in the domestic league will doom england .
those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .

" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

willy bogner , a former olympic skier , will be replaced by his deputy , bernhard schwank . willy bogner was forced to resign on monday from his position as head of munich 's bid committee for the 2018 winter olympics after less than 10 months on the job .
bogner said health problems had forced him to step down .
the bid committee made the announcement in a statement , one week after the 68-year-old former skier , fashion designer and filmmaker said he was suffering from diverticulitis , a digestive disease mainly found in the large intestine .
" my illness is more serious than originally believed , " bogner , who took charge of the committee last november , explained in monday 's statement .
" i will continue to support our bid … we stand a great chance , and i hope that my dream of olympics and paralympics in my home area becomes a reality . "
bogner 's deputy , bernhard schwank , has been promoted from the role of managing director to the new munich olympics bid committee chief .

" we had hoped for a little bit more , " bogner admitted when the budget was increased to 33 million euros -lrb- $ 42.5 million -rrb- on july 15 , amid rumors that he had threatened to resign from his post over the issue .

bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "
international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' hardline president has virtually stifled the free press the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the european parliament have called for an independent investigation into bebenin 's death .
" this is particularly important to avoid exacerbating the chilling effect on belorussian media that questions over his death would have , " the osce 's media freedom representative , dunja mijatovic said in a statement praising bebenin 's charter97 website as " one of a few non-governmental sources of information " in belarus .
television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.09.2010 german court rules against youtube in copyright row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube has vowed to fight the ruling internet giant google has suffered a setback after a german court ruled that its subsidiary , youtube , is responsible for videos its users upload in violation of copyright law . a hamburg court ruled on friday that youtube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted material without permission .
the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food .

the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .

and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .

" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 06.09.2010 misapprehensions abound ahead of euro 2012 in poland and ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro 2012 is coming to eastern europe one host country wo n't be ready for the tournament , and foreigners in the domestic league will doom england .
those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .

smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .

" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food .

the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .

and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .

the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.09.2010 german court rules against youtube in copyright row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube has vowed to fight the ruling internet giant google has suffered a setback after a german court ruled that its subsidiary , youtube , is responsible for videos its users upload in violation of copyright law . a hamburg court ruled on friday that youtube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted material without permission .
the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

willy bogner , a former olympic skier , will be replaced by his deputy , bernhard schwank . willy bogner was forced to resign on monday from his position as head of munich 's bid committee for the 2018 winter olympics after less than 10 months on the job .
bogner said health problems had forced him to step down .
the bid committee made the announcement in a statement , one week after the 68-year-old former skier , fashion designer and filmmaker said he was suffering from diverticulitis , a digestive disease mainly found in the large intestine .
" my illness is more serious than originally believed , " bogner , who took charge of the committee last november , explained in monday 's statement .
" i will continue to support our bid … we stand a great chance , and i hope that my dream of olympics and paralympics in my home area becomes a reality . "
bogner 's deputy , bernhard schwank , has been promoted from the role of managing director to the new munich olympics bid committee chief .
katarina witt , the double olympic figure skating champion , has been appointed presenter of the munich campaign , while bogner will remain part of the team , taking a position on the supervisory board .

july was also a turbulent month for the would-be organizers , as they fought protests from local communities unwilling to host various events and tried to secure an increased budget to fund the campaign .
" we had hoped for a little bit more , " bogner admitted when the budget was increased to 33 million euros -lrb- $ 42.5 million -rrb- on july 15 , amid rumors that he had threatened to resign from his post over the issue .
even the state premier of bavaria , horst seehofer , was compelled to jump into the debate , describing the various problems as " not conducive " to the olympic bid .
munich is competing against pyeongchang , south korea and the french resort of annecy for the games .
the international olympic committee will reveal the winning bid on july 6 , 2011 , at a planned session in durban , south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 06.09.2010 misapprehensions abound ahead of euro 2012 in poland and ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro 2012 is coming to eastern europe one host country wo n't be ready for the tournament , and foreigners in the domestic league will doom england .
those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 06.09.2010 misapprehensions abound ahead of euro 2012 in poland and ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro 2012 is coming to eastern europe one host country wo n't be ready for the tournament , and foreigners in the domestic league will doom england .
those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "

television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

bebenin was an outspoken government critic . the funeral for leading belarus opposition journalist oleg bebenin took place in silence , without speeches , on monday , according to the family 's wishes .
the founder of the opposition website charter97.org , operating in a tightly controlled media landscape , was found hanged at his weekend home outside of the capital minsk on friday .
" suicide is the primary lead on the cause of death , " a spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office said .
" but prosecutors will work on those other leads which are usually explored after a body is found in a noose . "
however , friends and colleagues of the 36-year-old do n't believe that bebenin would have committed suicide , pointing out that he was in contact with friends and planning cinema trips via text message on the day of his death .
" his family and i can not see why he would decide to kill himself , " journalist and close friend irina khalip told the afp news agency .
" he loved his five-year-old son very much . "
opposition politician oleg sannikov , who plans to run as a presidential candidate against hardline incumbent of 16 years alexander lukashenko in forthcoming elections , also did n't believe that bebenin would have taken his own life .
" i do not believe in the version of suicide and will tell this to the prosecutors , " sannikov said of bebenin , who had been acting as a spokesman for the politician .
" oleg was a good , reliable and talented person .
he had many plans . "
international concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' hardline president has virtually stifled the free press the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and the european parliament have called for an independent investigation into bebenin 's death .
" this is particularly important to avoid exacerbating the chilling effect on belorussian media that questions over his death would have , " the osce 's media freedom representative , dunja mijatovic said in a statement praising bebenin 's charter97 website as " one of a few non-governmental sources of information " in belarus .
television and most print media in the ex-soviet nation are state-controlled , and many independent newspapers have been ordered to shut down , sometimes continuing their operations on the internet .
according to the ap news agency , the editor of a remaining opposition newspaper who questioned the circumstances of bebenin 's death has since received death threats herself .
svetlana kalinkina , who edits the narodnaya volya paper , said she received an email with death threats after suggesting bebenin might have been killed .
three journalists have been killed or have gone missing since authoritarian president lukashenko came to power in 1994 , and the leader has been linked to the disappearances or deaths of several political opponents .
bebenko had published information concerning these issues on his website .
political ally oleg sannikov pointed out on russian television that bebenko had been kidnapped in 1997 and had been beaten up and threatened in recent years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.09.2010 politicians could learn from beethoven , says festival head ilona schmiel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel says beethoven inspires enthusiasm utopia , freedom and international exchange are at the core of this year 's beethovenfest .
beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .

the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.09.2010 politicians could learn from beethoven , says festival head ilona schmiel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel says beethoven inspires enthusiasm utopia , freedom and international exchange are at the core of this year 's beethovenfest .
beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .

so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "

" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.09.2010 politicians could learn from beethoven , says festival head ilona schmiel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel says beethoven inspires enthusiasm utopia , freedom and international exchange are at the core of this year 's beethovenfest .
beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

the young men had beaten a 50-year-old at a train station in munich after the man tried to protect four students from being attacked . nearly a year after dominik brunner died after being beaten at a train station , a munich court sentenced 19-year-old markus s. to nine years and 10 months for murder , just below the maximum sentence of 10 years for youth offenders .
his friend sebastian l. , who is now 18 years of age , got seven years for assault resulting in death .
" the perpetrators wanted to take revenge on brunner for interfering , " judge reinhold baier said on monday .
markus s. in particular " accepted the fact that his victim could die , " with both men attacking brunner " violently and repeatedly , " the judge added .
he said it was clear that their actions were the cause of brunner 's death .
joachim herrmann , interior minister of the state of bavaria , where munich is located , welcomed the verdict , saying it was " a clear signal that we do not tolerate brutal violence . "
courageous move the fight broke out after brunner had tried to protect four students from being attacked by the two youths at a train station in the munich suburb of solln on sept . 12 , 2009 .
the two young men had tried to force the students to give them money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus s. and sebastian l. attacked their victim ' violently and repeatedly ' prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 10 years for youth offenders for markus s. and eight years for sebastian l. although markus s. had already turned 18 at the time of the crime , german law gives judges the option of treating persons under 21 years of age as adolescents .
the defense had argued for a more lenient sentence , arguing that brunner did not die of the injuries and had also hit the two teenagers first .
order of merit the 50-year-old brunner sustained serious injuries , but died of a heart condition brought on by the beating , rather than the injuries themselves .
witness statements also identified him as being the first one to lash out at one of the men , albeit to prevent him from attacking the other youths .
brunner was awarded the german order of merit posthumously for acting as a role model of civil courage .

now , a police seminar is providing answers on what to do in a public emergency . the train station in solln , a suburb of munich , is n't particularly noteworthy .
here , the city 's apartment buildings have given way to family homes with gardens .
trains running on just two tracks service solln 's station , which is right next door to an elementary school .
but despite being nondescript , nearly everyone in germany has heard of the solln train station .
it was here that dominik brunner , a 50-year-old business man , was beaten up by two teenagers last september .
he later died in hospital .
brunner had stepped in to stop the teenagers from bullying some young boys , and was praised as a hero for his civil courage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brutal beating at solln shocked the german public but not everyone would have gotten physically involved in the situation .
passengers at the solln station had mixed feelings about how they would have reacted .
" i would think twice , " says one man .
" if someone gets hurt while trying to defend others , and the injuries kept them from working , they would n't get any financial support or a new job , even though they were just trying to help . "
one woman waiting for the train at solln said she would have tried to call the police and at least get the children out of harm 's way .
another man says he would only get involved if he thought he had a physical advantage .
boosting civil courage it 's a difficult hypothetical question to answer , but to help people prepare should they ever become involved in an emergency , police in munich are offering seminars aimed at boosting civil courage .
the seminars are held in the german transportation museum in munich .
among the classic cars , motorcycles and locomotives on display , the museum has an actual train car just like the ones used in munich today .
the two police officers running the course , sandra weiss and sandra dubiel , use the train car to conduct role playing exercises .
after the participants take a seat on a simulated train ride through munich , officer weiss - playing the role of the bad guy - enters the train .
under the friendly pretence of asking an elderly woman for a cigarette lighter , weiss gets the woman to open her purse .
then she steals the woman 's wallet .
weiss walked past all the passengers in the train , but no one reacted , and she was able to exit the train with the stolen property .
ronald wirth , a 46-year-old man from solln , was one of the passengers in the exercise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police want citizens to respond to crime , in whatever way they can " i was aware that someone had been robbed , " says wirth , " but there were just a few seconds where i did n't know how to react .
all these possibilities went through my head but i could n't decide what to do .
then the thief was gone . "
tied by indecision back in her normal role as a police officer , sandra weiss says people generally want to help in these situations , but they freeze up .
" i describe it as being stuck in a holding pattern , " she says .
" people think : ' i need to help .
yes - right - okay , i should help .
but … how ? '
that 's what we 're hoping to address with the course .
we want people to consider ahead of time - what would i do if something happens ? "
a situation can often be defused simply by taking control verbally .
the munich police say just over 68 percent of conflict situations can be stopped verbally .
had the victim of the theft forcefully said ' no !
take your hands out of my purse ! ' rather than passively allowing the thief to search for a cigarette lighter , the situation may have been avoided .
any of the passengers could have also physically restrained the criminal with no legal consequences .
any reaction better than no reaction or course , not everyone is going to be prepared to get physically involved in a confrontation - and police say that protecting your own safety is the most important .
" civil courage just means that a person goes through life with open eyes and does something rather than just look away , " says sandra dubiel , the other officer conducting the course .
" no one has to get physically involved , but anyone can call the police .
the worst thing is to look the other way .
that 's what we do n't want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when situations arise , commuters often do n't know what to do in addition to learning verbal means of defusing tense situations and alternatives to getting directly involved - such as calling the police - officer dubiel uses sparring gloves to demonstrate some basic self-defense maneuvers in case of a personal attack .
but , she adds , the techniques should only be used to create a chance to escape a dangerous situation , not to win a fight .
when self-defense techniques are used , a confrontation is stopped eighty-four percent of the time a chance to feel prepared at 70 years old , paula stocker says she is n't likely to jump in the middle of a fight , but she takes a swing at the sparring gloves anyway .
she feels like the course has given her tools to react in some way if there was an emergency .
" i feel safer , and more prepared , " stocker says .
" i 'd also be happy if something ever happened to me that the people around me would have these tips ready , too . "
participants in the course are also taught to use aed -lrb- automated external defibrillator -rrb- devices that are often found in public places such as train stations .
an aed can improve a heart attack victim 's chances of survival by delivering an electric shock to the heart to restore normal beating rhythm .
the public interest in civil courage has grown since dominik brunner 's death , and the seminars teaching tips for reacting to any emergency situation - violent or otherwise - are generally booked quickly .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 06.09.2010 taming the arctic : how to govern the spoils of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melting arctic ice is making resources and trade routes more accessible a small clique of northern countries currently governs the arctic circle .
but as the polar ice cap melts , external powers have expressed an interest in the energy-rich region , raising eyebrows among the arctic nations . as the arctic circle undergoes its perennial summer thaw , a series of expeditions have set sail for the high north .
russia recently sent its largest expedition in a decade while the us and canada are conducting a joint mission in the beaufort sea .
these expeditions often wear a facade of scientific inquiry , but their findings could have sweeping political implications .
the arctic powers are mapping the seabed so they can back up their competing territorial claims in the region .
territory is not the only thing at stake .
abundant resources also lie in the depths of the arctic ocean .
as the globe warms and arctic ice melts , a fortune in oil and gas could become accessible .
the us geological survey has reported that 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas sits in the arctic ocean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia planted its flag in the arctic seabed in 2007 global warming means new trade routes are also opening in the high north .
the northwest passage , which connects the atlantic and pacific oceans via arctic canada , became navigable in 2007 .
and the northeast passage , which connects europe to asia across northern russia , has also become easier to traverse .
as a result , governance in the arctic has become more than a regional power game .
it has far-reaching political and economic implications for a globalized world , and non-arctic nations are beginning to take note . usual suspects " this is n't the 15th century .
you ca n't go around the world and just plant flags and say ' we 're claiming this territory ' , " said peter mackay - at the time canada 's foreign minister - in august 2007 . a russian expedition had just set a titanium , rust-proof flag in the north pole 's seabed .
members of the expedition compared the flag planting to the us moon landing in 1969 , saying it marked a scientific , rather than political , achievement .
but other nations saw a russian attempt to prematurely claim the abundant resources that lie trapped under the arctic 's receding ice .
now canada , denmark , norway and the us have begun to stake out their piece of the arctic pie as well .
maritime claims are governed by the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the treaty allows nations exclusive economic access to an area that stretches 200 nautical miles from their coastlines .
this area can be expanded to 350 nautical miles if a geographic connection to the mainland can be proven .
energy and trade are at stake so expeditions are crisscrossing the arctic , looking for geographic evidence that will support their claims before an international tribunal .
for instance , russia says the lomonosov ridge , which lies under the arctic ocean , is a natural extension of its territory .
most of the energy resources lie within the arctic powers ' current exclusive economic areas .
this means that territorial claims will not necessarily bring more riches in oil and gas .
but the potential for additional unclaimed resources to be found has whetted the appetite for territorial expansion .
beyond the search for energy , the management of newly accessible shipping routes could change the geography of international trade .
the us and canada dispute the status of the northwest passage .
canada claims that it has sovereignty over the potentially lucrative trade route , while the us believes it lies in international waters .
" in a way the -lsb- canadian -rsb- government has harped on the sovereignty theme to the exclusion of others as they 've tried to broach the international dimensions of canada 's interests in the north , " franklyn griffiths , an expert on arctic politics and professor emeritus of political science at the university of toronto , told deutsche welle .
" sovereignty is the big thing . "
new contender : china the opening of new trade routes has implications for the entire world , not just the high north .
china has no geographic connection to arctic circle .
but as the world 's top exporter , it has a major stake in international trade .
currently , chinese products have to travel through dangerous choke points on their route to global markets .
chinese vessels must first navigate through the straits of malacca , which connects the pacific and indian oceans .
once this hurdle has been passed , ships then have to pass the horn of africa on their way toward the suez canal .
this route is vulnerable to piracy , particularly off the coast of somalia .
the opening of the northeast passage across russia 's northern coast would reduce the trip from beijing to hamburg by 6,400 kilometers -lrb- 4,000 miles -rrb- and allow chinese vessels to bypass the traditional voyage through malacca and the suez .
bildunterschrift : the arctic powers could use their territorial claims to create spheres of influence " i think china is interested in the arctic for the same reason as other non-polar states have also become interested , " linda jakobson , director of the stockholm international peace research institute 's program on china and global security , told deutsche welle .
" china 's economic development is to a large extent dependent on foreign trade , and china 's foreign trade is heavily dependent on shipping .
anything that offers china new trade routes is of interest to china . "
a chinese vessel set sail for the arctic this summer to conduct research .
and a russian tanker recently undertook the treacherous journey across the northeast passage to deliver gas condensate in china .
as beijing 's interests in the region grow , it is taking care not to upset the regional power balance .
respect for territorial integrity is a hallmark of chinese foreign policy , and officials in beijing have made it clear that they will respect the arctic powers ' sovereignty .
however , " china has made it very clear it would like to see the littoral states take in the interests of non-littoral states , " jakobson said .
" china would very much like to see non-arctic states being a part of the process . "
arctic land grab ?
the five major arctic powers declared in 2008 that they will use current international arrangements to govern the arctic region .
this means that territorial disputes will be resolved through the law of the sea , and regional dialogue will take place within the arctic council , a multilateral forum that manages development and environmental issues in the high north .
but this arrangement could preclude non-arctic states from voicing their developing interests in the region .
china can only participate in the arctic council on an ad-hoc basis , which means it has to apply to participate in each meeting .
the chinese have submitted an application for permanent observer status , but as yet the council has not made a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new trade routes could greatly impact china with non-arctic states like china currently playing a marginal role , the five arctic powers could establish spheres of influence in the region before the international community is able to gain a foothold .
" time and again there have been historical attempts by the bordering states to create sovereignty or spheres of influence in the arctic , " ruediger wolfrum , an expert on the law of the sea and director of the max planck institute for comparative public law and international law , told deutsche welle .
he proposes an international conference , in which non-arctic states have participation rights , to create a global consensus before disputes grow in number .
griffiths advocates the expansion of canadian arctic policy beyond sovereignty issues and supports a greater role for non-arctic states .
but at the same time , he encourages these states to participate more in existing institutions .
" they should get involved and contribute to the working groups of the arctic council and show good faith and what they have to offer instead of whining about not being included in the arctic council as full and equal members , " he said . author : spencer kimball editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 merkel hails contentious new power policy as greenest in the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extended nuclear power usage is a tough sell for merkel germany 's chancellor says her coalition 's plan to extend the lifespan of nuclear power plants as a bridge towards renewable energy will prove the most environmentally friendly in the world .
but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he 'll need to improve to cement his status . as rises go , holger badstuber 's was pretty meteoric .
in the space of nine months , he went from bayern 's reserve squad to the starting 11 and earned a call-up to the nationalelf as well .
" you hardly have time to ponder it or review the situation , " badstuber told deutsche welle .
" life happens so quickly , and new challenges come . "
but he faces a very different challenge this season compared to the last : trying to prove that his breakthrough was no fluke .
the young defender played in all but one of bayern 's bundesliga matches last season and was a fixture in campaign that saw them reach the final of the champions league .
he also began the 2010 world cup in germany 's starting line-up , but was benched after his performance in germany 's group-stage loss to serbia .
nonetheless , germany coach joachim loew promised to give him another chance .
" footballers like him are a rarity in germany , " loew said during the tournament .
" we 're going to need him , and i 'm not going to drop him . "
loew proved as good as his word , starting badstuber ahead of veteran heiko westermann in germany 's first euro 2010 qualifier against belgium .
the question is : can the youngster repay that trust ?
switching position bildunterschrift : badstuber did n't always get to the ball against belgium badstuber drew mixed reviews for his work against the belgians .
on the one hand , germany kept a clean sheet in that match , winning 1-0 .
but early on , badstuber had trouble containing young belgian striker romelo likaku , and his occasional forays into the opponents ' half were tentative and unproductive .
part of the problem may be that he 's playing a different position .
for both germany and bayern , he 's moved into central defense from left back .
" a left-footer can play different sorts of balls , passes have a different sort of spin , so i think it 's better to have a left-footer than a right-footer on the left side , " badstuber said .
" a left-footer can hit passes while at full sprint .
the ideal , of course , is to be equally good with both feet , but that 's seldom the case . "
the move to the middle , however , came at badstuber 's own request .
he sees himself as a central defender - and not without reason .
at 1.89 meters , the youngster has the stature to play in the thick of it , while his size is a disadvantage at a position usually occupied by smaller speedsters like philipp lahm .
but playing in the middle also means that mistakes usually have more serious consequences , as badstuber learned in bayern 's last bundesliga match .
an awkward failed clearance led to opponents kaiserslautern 's second goal and sealed the reigning champions ' 2-0 upset defeat at the hands of a newly promoted squad .
future bulwark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 21-year-old badstuber is extraordinarily mature to develop further , badstuber needs the license to make such mistakes , and for both club and country , it looks as if he 'll be given that freedom .
his coaches in both the national team and in munich have praised his remarkable maturity and his understanding of the game .
he 's also completely committed to the sport , admitting that one of his favorite hobbies is spending time on his playstation - playing virtual football .
and he 's well aware that a career as a professional football involves more than an ordinary job .
" i knew -lsb- when i started -rsb- that it was going to be a huge challenge , " badstuber said .
" an outsider who does n't have much to do with football might think , ' they go to practice and then they go home . '
but it 's not like that .
football is a discipline , and you really have to live for it . "
and the competition is n't particularly strong at the moment .
at bayern , badstuber has successfully supplanted the error-prone martin demechelis , and in the national team , the future of arne friedrich - a 31-year-old defender with a gimpy back - is an open question .
in addition , central defense is usually a position occupied by experienced players , and the fact that badstuber has put himself into the mix while still so young is a powerful testimony to his talent .
so the smart money is betting that this likeable , gifted youngster will be able to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump and establish himself as one of germany 's main men in the middle for many years to come .

nonetheless , germany coach joachim loew promised to give him another chance .
" footballers like him are a rarity in germany , " loew said during the tournament .
" we 're going to need him , and i 'm not going to drop him . "
loew proved as good as his word , starting badstuber ahead of veteran heiko westermann in germany 's first euro 2010 qualifier against belgium .
the question is : can the youngster repay that trust ?
switching position bildunterschrift : badstuber did n't always get to the ball against belgium badstuber drew mixed reviews for his work against the belgians .
on the one hand , germany kept a clean sheet in that match , winning 1-0 .
but early on , badstuber had trouble containing young belgian striker romelo likaku , and his occasional forays into the opponents ' half were tentative and unproductive .
part of the problem may be that he 's playing a different position .
for both germany and bayern , he 's moved into central defense from left back .
" a left-footer can play different sorts of balls , passes have a different sort of spin , so i think it 's better to have a left-footer than a right-footer on the left side , " badstuber said .
" a left-footer can hit passes while at full sprint .
the ideal , of course , is to be equally good with both feet , but that 's seldom the case . "
the move to the middle , however , came at badstuber 's own request .
he sees himself as a central defender - and not without reason .
at 1.89 meters , the youngster has the stature to play in the thick of it , while his size is a disadvantage at a position usually occupied by smaller speedsters like philipp lahm .
but playing in the middle also means that mistakes usually have more serious consequences , as badstuber learned in bayern 's last bundesliga match .
an awkward failed clearance led to opponents kaiserslautern 's second goal and sealed the reigning champions ' 2-0 upset defeat at the hands of a newly promoted squad .
future bulwark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 21-year-old badstuber is extraordinarily mature to develop further , badstuber needs the license to make such mistakes , and for both club and country , it looks as if he 'll be given that freedom .
his coaches in both the national team and in munich have praised his remarkable maturity and his understanding of the game .
he 's also completely committed to the sport , admitting that one of his favorite hobbies is spending time on his playstation - playing virtual football .
and he 's well aware that a career as a professional football involves more than an ordinary job .
" i knew -lsb- when i started -rsb- that it was going to be a huge challenge , " badstuber said .
" an outsider who does n't have much to do with football might think , ' they go to practice and then they go home . '
but it 's not like that .
football is a discipline , and you really have to live for it . "
and the competition is n't particularly strong at the moment .
at bayern , badstuber has successfully supplanted the error-prone martin demechelis , and in the national team , the future of arne friedrich - a 31-year-old defender with a gimpy back - is an open question .
in addition , central defense is usually a position occupied by experienced players , and the fact that badstuber has put himself into the mix while still so young is a powerful testimony to his talent .
so the smart money is betting that this likeable , gifted youngster will be able to avoid the dreaded sophomore slump and establish himself as one of germany 's main men in the middle for many years to come .

new types of financial crimes will be investigated . calling it a " milestone " in the fight against corruption worldwide , un secretary-general ban ki-moon opened what is being billed as the world 's first anti-corruption academy late last week , promising that it will train a new generation of law enforcers and focus on new types of graft , especially in the financial and business arenas .
the new international anti-corruption academy -lrb- iaca -rrb- , which is backed by the un office on drugs and crime , the austrian government and the european anti-fraud office , will be based near vienna and will bring together leading players from the worlds of finance , business and politics to study the causes of and new cures for organized crime and fraud .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 06.09.2010 un 's new anti-corruption academy aims spotlight at financial crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graft costs the world economy 1.5 trillion euros a year the united nations has launched what is being called the first anti-corruption academy , aimed at turning out a new generation of top-of-the-line corruption fighters .
new types of financial crimes will be investigated . calling it a " milestone " in the fight against corruption worldwide , un secretary-general ban ki-moon opened what is being billed as the world 's first anti-corruption academy late last week , promising that it will train a new generation of law enforcers and focus on new types of graft , especially in the financial and business arenas .
the new international anti-corruption academy -lrb- iaca -rrb- , which is backed by the un office on drugs and crime , the austrian government and the european anti-fraud office , will be based near vienna and will bring together leading players from the worlds of finance , business and politics to study the causes of and new cures for organized crime and fraud .
" traditional methods are proving no match for new types of corruption , especially financial crimes , " said ban , who added that current training programs lack specialization and the academy will bring its students new tools to tackle " technical corruption to the fullest possible extent . "
those students will be judges , investigators and police officers from around the world .
some courses have already begun and a full academic program will kick off in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon says intolerance of corruption is growing " the academy certain wo n't make any claims of training super-men , " said martin kreutner , who chair 's the institution 's steering committee .
" rather the academy will close the gaps which exist between those involved in the practice on one side and the theorists and scientists on the other . "
financial corruption the world bank estimates the cost of corruption to the world economy to be some $ 2 trillion -lrb- 1.5 trillion euros -rrb- .
contrary to much popular belief , corruption is not limited to developing countries .
while the most obvious examples of briefcases full of money tend to go to bureaucrats or authoritarian leaders , corruption in industrialized democracies is somewhat more sophisticated .
one often neglected dimension of corruption is " state capture , " or just " capture . "
this happens when powerful companies or individuals bend the regulatory , policy and legal institutions of the nation - developed or developing - for their private benefit .
this is typically done through high-level bribery , lobbying or influence peddling .
in more developed countries , subtler forms of capture and " legal corruption " exist .
perhaps it is the expectation of a future job for a regulator in a lobbying firm , or a campaign contribution with strings attached .
it could be nepotism or overly aggressive lobbying .
in many countries this may be legal , even if it is unethical .
in the united states , the country 's two largest mortgage finance lenders , freddie mac and fannie mae , spent millions of dollars lobbying legislators in exchange for , among other things , lax capital reserve rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international says corruption was largely behind the financial crisis indeed , bribery and corruption within the financial system were partly to blame for the global economic crisis , according to a report from anti-corruption group transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- .
corruption and lack of corporate integrity was a basic underlying cause of the global financial crisis , " the report said .
the ti report cited a survey of executives from oecd countries that found almost one-half had secured business in non-oecd countries through personal relationships .
the report also highlighted the potential negative effects of business lobbying , in particular the 16,500 lobbyists working in brussels to influence decisions at the eu level .
corrosive effect besides contributing to the global economic meltdown , corruption also has a corrosive effect on societies with can even begin undermining a country 's political foundation .
" people no longer believe that there is equality , that the law applies to everyone , " said wolfgang hetzer , head of the european anti-fraud office .
" they think it does n't mean anything to go out and vote in elections because there are other means to get into certain positions and stay there . "

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.09.2010 german court rules against youtube in copyright row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube has vowed to fight the ruling internet giant google has suffered a setback after a german court ruled that its subsidiary , youtube , is responsible for videos its users upload in violation of copyright law . a hamburg court ruled on friday that youtube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted material without permission .
the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 06.09.2010 misapprehensions abound ahead of euro 2012 in poland and ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euro 2012 is coming to eastern europe one host country wo n't be ready for the tournament , and foreigners in the domestic league will doom england .
those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.09.2010 munich residents take courage classes in light of deadly beating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars in civil courage are held in real train carriages a beating at a train station near munich last year left a man dead and had many people wondering how they would have reacted .
now , a police seminar is providing answers on what to do in a public emergency . the train station in solln , a suburb of munich , is n't particularly noteworthy .
here , the city 's apartment buildings have given way to family homes with gardens .
trains running on just two tracks service solln 's station , which is right next door to an elementary school .
but despite being nondescript , nearly everyone in germany has heard of the solln train station .
it was here that dominik brunner , a 50-year-old business man , was beaten up by two teenagers last september .
he later died in hospital .
brunner had stepped in to stop the teenagers from bullying some young boys , and was praised as a hero for his civil courage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brutal beating at solln shocked the german public but not everyone would have gotten physically involved in the situation .
passengers at the solln station had mixed feelings about how they would have reacted .
" i would think twice , " says one man .
" if someone gets hurt while trying to defend others , and the injuries kept them from working , they would n't get any financial support or a new job , even though they were just trying to help . "
one woman waiting for the train at solln said she would have tried to call the police and at least get the children out of harm 's way .
another man says he would only get involved if he thought he had a physical advantage .
boosting civil courage it 's a difficult hypothetical question to answer , but to help people prepare should they ever become involved in an emergency , police in munich are offering seminars aimed at boosting civil courage .
the seminars are held in the german transportation museum in munich .
among the classic cars , motorcycles and locomotives on display , the museum has an actual train car just like the ones used in munich today .
the two police officers running the course , sandra weiss and sandra dubiel , use the train car to conduct role playing exercises .
after the participants take a seat on a simulated train ride through munich , officer weiss - playing the role of the bad guy - enters the train .
under the friendly pretence of asking an elderly woman for a cigarette lighter , weiss gets the woman to open her purse .
then she steals the woman 's wallet .
weiss walked past all the passengers in the train , but no one reacted , and she was able to exit the train with the stolen property .
ronald wirth , a 46-year-old man from solln , was one of the passengers in the exercise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police want citizens to respond to crime , in whatever way they can " i was aware that someone had been robbed , " says wirth , " but there were just a few seconds where i did n't know how to react .
all these possibilities went through my head but i could n't decide what to do .
then the thief was gone . "
tied by indecision back in her normal role as a police officer , sandra weiss says people generally want to help in these situations , but they freeze up .
" i describe it as being stuck in a holding pattern , " she says .
" people think : ' i need to help .
yes - right - okay , i should help .
but … how ? '
that 's what we 're hoping to address with the course .
we want people to consider ahead of time - what would i do if something happens ? "
a situation can often be defused simply by taking control verbally .
the munich police say just over 68 percent of conflict situations can be stopped verbally .
had the victim of the theft forcefully said ' no !
take your hands out of my purse ! ' rather than passively allowing the thief to search for a cigarette lighter , the situation may have been avoided .
any of the passengers could have also physically restrained the criminal with no legal consequences .
any reaction better than no reaction or course , not everyone is going to be prepared to get physically involved in a confrontation - and police say that protecting your own safety is the most important .
" civil courage just means that a person goes through life with open eyes and does something rather than just look away , " says sandra dubiel , the other officer conducting the course .
" no one has to get physically involved , but anyone can call the police .
the worst thing is to look the other way .
that 's what we do n't want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when situations arise , commuters often do n't know what to do in addition to learning verbal means of defusing tense situations and alternatives to getting directly involved - such as calling the police - officer dubiel uses sparring gloves to demonstrate some basic self-defense maneuvers in case of a personal attack .
but , she adds , the techniques should only be used to create a chance to escape a dangerous situation , not to win a fight .
when self-defense techniques are used , a confrontation is stopped eighty-four percent of the time a chance to feel prepared at 70 years old , paula stocker says she is n't likely to jump in the middle of a fight , but she takes a swing at the sparring gloves anyway .
she feels like the course has given her tools to react in some way if there was an emergency .
" i feel safer , and more prepared , " stocker says .
" i 'd also be happy if something ever happened to me that the people around me would have these tips ready , too . "
participants in the course are also taught to use aed -lrb- automated external defibrillator -rrb- devices that are often found in public places such as train stations .
an aed can improve a heart attack victim 's chances of survival by delivering an electric shock to the heart to restore normal beating rhythm .
the public interest in civil courage has grown since dominik brunner 's death , and the seminars teaching tips for reacting to any emergency situation - violent or otherwise - are generally booked quickly .

the low turnout has dashed hopes of a resolution to the political deadlock in the country . the moldovan government 's hopes of breaking the country 's political deadlock with legislation to directly elect a president have been dealt a terminal blow .
low voter turnout in a referendum on the matter means that the government could not obtain a mandate for the change to be enacted . just over 29 percent of the electorate voted in the poll .
the figure falls short of the 33 percent required for it to be binding , according to central election commission head yuri cocan .

moldova , a former soviet nation sandwiched between ukraine and romania , currently has no president .
the country 's liberal and pro-western coalition government has been unable to obtain the necessary three-fifths majority in parliament to elect one .

it called for a boycott of the referendum .
recent opinion polls showed that 75 to 90 percent of those who were planning to vote were in favor of direct presidential elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.09.2010 munich residents take courage classes in light of deadly beating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars in civil courage are held in real train carriages a beating at a train station near munich last year left a man dead and had many people wondering how they would have reacted .
now , a police seminar is providing answers on what to do in a public emergency . the train station in solln , a suburb of munich , is n't particularly noteworthy .
here , the city 's apartment buildings have given way to family homes with gardens .
trains running on just two tracks service solln 's station , which is right next door to an elementary school .
but despite being nondescript , nearly everyone in germany has heard of the solln train station .
it was here that dominik brunner , a 50-year-old business man , was beaten up by two teenagers last september .
he later died in hospital .
brunner had stepped in to stop the teenagers from bullying some young boys , and was praised as a hero for his civil courage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brutal beating at solln shocked the german public but not everyone would have gotten physically involved in the situation .
passengers at the solln station had mixed feelings about how they would have reacted .
" i would think twice , " says one man .
" if someone gets hurt while trying to defend others , and the injuries kept them from working , they would n't get any financial support or a new job , even though they were just trying to help . "
one woman waiting for the train at solln said she would have tried to call the police and at least get the children out of harm 's way .
another man says he would only get involved if he thought he had a physical advantage .
boosting civil courage it 's a difficult hypothetical question to answer , but to help people prepare should they ever become involved in an emergency , police in munich are offering seminars aimed at boosting civil courage .
the seminars are held in the german transportation museum in munich .
among the classic cars , motorcycles and locomotives on display , the museum has an actual train car just like the ones used in munich today .
the two police officers running the course , sandra weiss and sandra dubiel , use the train car to conduct role playing exercises .
after the participants take a seat on a simulated train ride through munich , officer weiss - playing the role of the bad guy - enters the train .
under the friendly pretence of asking an elderly woman for a cigarette lighter , weiss gets the woman to open her purse .
then she steals the woman 's wallet .
weiss walked past all the passengers in the train , but no one reacted , and she was able to exit the train with the stolen property .
ronald wirth , a 46-year-old man from solln , was one of the passengers in the exercise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police want citizens to respond to crime , in whatever way they can " i was aware that someone had been robbed , " says wirth , " but there were just a few seconds where i did n't know how to react .
all these possibilities went through my head but i could n't decide what to do .
then the thief was gone . "
tied by indecision back in her normal role as a police officer , sandra weiss says people generally want to help in these situations , but they freeze up .
" i describe it as being stuck in a holding pattern , " she says .
" people think : ' i need to help .
yes - right - okay , i should help .
but … how ? '
that 's what we 're hoping to address with the course .
we want people to consider ahead of time - what would i do if something happens ? "
a situation can often be defused simply by taking control verbally .
the munich police say just over 68 percent of conflict situations can be stopped verbally .
had the victim of the theft forcefully said ' no !
take your hands out of my purse ! ' rather than passively allowing the thief to search for a cigarette lighter , the situation may have been avoided .
any of the passengers could have also physically restrained the criminal with no legal consequences .
any reaction better than no reaction or course , not everyone is going to be prepared to get physically involved in a confrontation - and police say that protecting your own safety is the most important .
" civil courage just means that a person goes through life with open eyes and does something rather than just look away , " says sandra dubiel , the other officer conducting the course .
" no one has to get physically involved , but anyone can call the police .
the worst thing is to look the other way .
that 's what we do n't want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when situations arise , commuters often do n't know what to do in addition to learning verbal means of defusing tense situations and alternatives to getting directly involved - such as calling the police - officer dubiel uses sparring gloves to demonstrate some basic self-defense maneuvers in case of a personal attack .
but , she adds , the techniques should only be used to create a chance to escape a dangerous situation , not to win a fight .
when self-defense techniques are used , a confrontation is stopped eighty-four percent of the time a chance to feel prepared at 70 years old , paula stocker says she is n't likely to jump in the middle of a fight , but she takes a swing at the sparring gloves anyway .
she feels like the course has given her tools to react in some way if there was an emergency .
" i feel safer , and more prepared , " stocker says .
" i 'd also be happy if something ever happened to me that the people around me would have these tips ready , too . "
participants in the course are also taught to use aed -lrb- automated external defibrillator -rrb- devices that are often found in public places such as train stations .
an aed can improve a heart attack victim 's chances of survival by delivering an electric shock to the heart to restore normal beating rhythm .
the public interest in civil courage has grown since dominik brunner 's death , and the seminars teaching tips for reacting to any emergency situation - violent or otherwise - are generally booked quickly .

it was here that dominik brunner , a 50-year-old business man , was beaten up by two teenagers last september .
he later died in hospital .
brunner had stepped in to stop the teenagers from bullying some young boys , and was praised as a hero for his civil courage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brutal beating at solln shocked the german public but not everyone would have gotten physically involved in the situation .
passengers at the solln station had mixed feelings about how they would have reacted .
" i would think twice , " says one man .
" if someone gets hurt while trying to defend others , and the injuries kept them from working , they would n't get any financial support or a new job , even though they were just trying to help . "
one woman waiting for the train at solln said she would have tried to call the police and at least get the children out of harm 's way .
another man says he would only get involved if he thought he had a physical advantage .
boosting civil courage it 's a difficult hypothetical question to answer , but to help people prepare should they ever become involved in an emergency , police in munich are offering seminars aimed at boosting civil courage .
the seminars are held in the german transportation museum in munich .
among the classic cars , motorcycles and locomotives on display , the museum has an actual train car just like the ones used in munich today .
the two police officers running the course , sandra weiss and sandra dubiel , use the train car to conduct role playing exercises .
after the participants take a seat on a simulated train ride through munich , officer weiss - playing the role of the bad guy - enters the train .
under the friendly pretence of asking an elderly woman for a cigarette lighter , weiss gets the woman to open her purse .
then she steals the woman 's wallet .
weiss walked past all the passengers in the train , but no one reacted , and she was able to exit the train with the stolen property .
ronald wirth , a 46-year-old man from solln , was one of the passengers in the exercise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police want citizens to respond to crime , in whatever way they can " i was aware that someone had been robbed , " says wirth , " but there were just a few seconds where i did n't know how to react .
all these possibilities went through my head but i could n't decide what to do .
then the thief was gone . "
tied by indecision back in her normal role as a police officer , sandra weiss says people generally want to help in these situations , but they freeze up .
" i describe it as being stuck in a holding pattern , " she says .
" people think : ' i need to help .
yes - right - okay , i should help .
but … how ? '
that 's what we 're hoping to address with the course .
we want people to consider ahead of time - what would i do if something happens ? "
a situation can often be defused simply by taking control verbally .
the munich police say just over 68 percent of conflict situations can be stopped verbally .
had the victim of the theft forcefully said ' no !
take your hands out of my purse ! ' rather than passively allowing the thief to search for a cigarette lighter , the situation may have been avoided .
any of the passengers could have also physically restrained the criminal with no legal consequences .
any reaction better than no reaction or course , not everyone is going to be prepared to get physically involved in a confrontation - and police say that protecting your own safety is the most important .
" civil courage just means that a person goes through life with open eyes and does something rather than just look away , " says sandra dubiel , the other officer conducting the course .
" no one has to get physically involved , but anyone can call the police .
the worst thing is to look the other way .
that 's what we do n't want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when situations arise , commuters often do n't know what to do in addition to learning verbal means of defusing tense situations and alternatives to getting directly involved - such as calling the police - officer dubiel uses sparring gloves to demonstrate some basic self-defense maneuvers in case of a personal attack .
but , she adds , the techniques should only be used to create a chance to escape a dangerous situation , not to win a fight .
when self-defense techniques are used , a confrontation is stopped eighty-four percent of the time a chance to feel prepared at 70 years old , paula stocker says she is n't likely to jump in the middle of a fight , but she takes a swing at the sparring gloves anyway .
she feels like the course has given her tools to react in some way if there was an emergency .
" i feel safer , and more prepared , " stocker says .
" i 'd also be happy if something ever happened to me that the people around me would have these tips ready , too . "
participants in the course are also taught to use aed -lrb- automated external defibrillator -rrb- devices that are often found in public places such as train stations .
an aed can improve a heart attack victim 's chances of survival by delivering an electric shock to the heart to restore normal beating rhythm .
the public interest in civil courage has grown since dominik brunner 's death , and the seminars teaching tips for reacting to any emergency situation - violent or otherwise - are generally booked quickly .

the low turnout has dashed hopes of a resolution to the political deadlock in the country . the moldovan government 's hopes of breaking the country 's political deadlock with legislation to directly elect a president have been dealt a terminal blow .
low voter turnout in a referendum on the matter means that the government could not obtain a mandate for the change to be enacted . just over 29 percent of the electorate voted in the poll .
the figure falls short of the 33 percent required for it to be binding , according to central election commission head yuri cocan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters last year put a pro-western coalition in power dissolution of parliament the referendum 's failure was expected to lead to the dissolution of the parliament and snap elections .
moldova , a former soviet nation sandwiched between ukraine and romania , currently has no president .
the country 's liberal and pro-western coalition government has been unable to obtain the necessary three-fifths majority in parliament to elect one .
the communist party , which held power from 2001 until last year and has a large minority in parliament , claims that the vote is a coalition plot to seize power .
it called for a boycott of the referendum .
recent opinion polls showed that 75 to 90 percent of those who were planning to vote were in favor of direct presidential elections .

the czechs have n't viewed them as fellow countrymen - until recently . most people probably think of composer gustav mahler as an austrian composer - after all , german was his first language .
but the state he was born in has long since disappeared . mahler , the son of a jewish coachman and innkeeper , was born in 1860 in what is now the czech republic , but then was the bohemian region of the austro-hungarian empire .
he and his family would have called their little village kalischt , though the czechs now call it kaliste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz kafka has long been associated with prague gustav mahler is one of a dozen german-speaking personalities being profiled this month at an exhibition at the prager literaturhaus , a czech institute that promotes the city 's german literary heritage . language barrier other household names , like the world 's most famous neurologist , have ties to the region and are included in the exhibition . " sigmund freud stayed here for only three years , but he was so influenced by his surroundings where he grew up , " the institute 's director , lucie cernohousova , said of another well-known local .
" his analysis and his work was influenced by his czech , or moravian roots . "
the moravian region now makes up the eastern portion of the czech republic , while bohemia represents the western part of the country . the exhibition , called " born in bohemia and moravia - but forgotten by us ? " suggests that many czechs have little or no idea that people such as mahler , freud , automobile giant ferdinand porsche , and holocaust hero oskar schindler were born in their country . " obviously , franz kafka is an item for the prague tourist industry , and there are several museums devoted to his memory , " said petr brod , a prague-based journalist with a keen interest in czech-german history .
" with freud , it 's a bit more difficult , but people in moravia probably know that he was born in -lsb- the czech city of -rsb- pribor . " with the others , few people outside of a small circle of czech intellectuals would recognize them as fellow countryman , added brod . changing attitude the exhibition at the prager literaturhaus is the work of wolfgang schwarz , a historian who works for the munich-based adalbert stifter association , which was founded by some of the three million ethnic germans expelled from czechoslovakia after world war ii .
adalbert stifter himself is one of the 12 personalities honored in the exhibition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many ethnic germans left czechoslovakia during or after world war ii schwarz says the czechs are becoming gradually more interested in the german speakers who were born in their lands . " i think a lot 's changed in the last few years , " said schwarz , who speaks czech fluently .
" you can see that by just visiting the towns where these people were born . " he explained that in pribor , the birthplace of sigmund freud , the local authorities have named a street after him and erected a monument to him on the town square . author : rob cameron , prague editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the state he was born in has long since disappeared . mahler , the son of a jewish coachman and innkeeper , was born in 1860 in what is now the czech republic , but then was the bohemian region of the austro-hungarian empire .
he and his family would have called their little village kalischt , though the czechs now call it kaliste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz kafka has long been associated with prague gustav mahler is one of a dozen german-speaking personalities being profiled this month at an exhibition at the prager literaturhaus , a czech institute that promotes the city 's german literary heritage . language barrier other household names , like the world 's most famous neurologist , have ties to the region and are included in the exhibition . " sigmund freud stayed here for only three years , but he was so influenced by his surroundings where he grew up , " the institute 's director , lucie cernohousova , said of another well-known local .
" his analysis and his work was influenced by his czech , or moravian roots . "
the moravian region now makes up the eastern portion of the czech republic , while bohemia represents the western part of the country . the exhibition , called " born in bohemia and moravia - but forgotten by us ? " suggests that many czechs have little or no idea that people such as mahler , freud , automobile giant ferdinand porsche , and holocaust hero oskar schindler were born in their country . " obviously , franz kafka is an item for the prague tourist industry , and there are several museums devoted to his memory , " said petr brod , a prague-based journalist with a keen interest in czech-german history .
" with freud , it 's a bit more difficult , but people in moravia probably know that he was born in -lsb- the czech city of -rsb- pribor . " with the others , few people outside of a small circle of czech intellectuals would recognize them as fellow countryman , added brod . changing attitude the exhibition at the prager literaturhaus is the work of wolfgang schwarz , a historian who works for the munich-based adalbert stifter association , which was founded by some of the three million ethnic germans expelled from czechoslovakia after world war ii .
adalbert stifter himself is one of the 12 personalities honored in the exhibition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many ethnic germans left czechoslovakia during or after world war ii schwarz says the czechs are becoming gradually more interested in the german speakers who were born in their lands . " i think a lot 's changed in the last few years , " said schwarz , who speaks czech fluently .
" you can see that by just visiting the towns where these people were born . " he explained that in pribor , the birthplace of sigmund freud , the local authorities have named a street after him and erected a monument to him on the town square . author : rob cameron , prague editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the young men had beaten a 50-year-old at a train station in munich after the man tried to protect four students from being attacked . nearly a year after dominik brunner died after being beaten at a train station , a munich court sentenced 19-year-old markus s. to nine years and 10 months for murder , just below the maximum sentence of 10 years for youth offenders .
his friend sebastian l. , who is now 18 years of age , got seven years for assault resulting in death .
" the perpetrators wanted to take revenge on brunner for interfering , " judge reinhold baier said on monday .
markus s. in particular " accepted the fact that his victim could die , " with both men attacking brunner " violently and repeatedly , " the judge added .
he said it was clear that their actions were the cause of brunner 's death .
joachim herrmann , interior minister of the state of bavaria , where munich is located , welcomed the verdict , saying it was " a clear signal that we do not tolerate brutal violence . "
courageous move the fight broke out after brunner had tried to protect four students from being attacked by the two youths at a train station in the munich suburb of solln on sept . 12 , 2009 .
the two young men had tried to force the students to give them money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus s. and sebastian l. attacked their victim ' violently and repeatedly ' prosecutors had demanded the maximum sentence of 10 years for youth offenders for markus s. and eight years for sebastian l. although markus s. had already turned 18 at the time of the crime , german law gives judges the option of treating persons under 21 years of age as adolescents .
the defense had argued for a more lenient sentence , arguing that brunner did not die of the injuries and had also hit the two teenagers first .
order of merit the 50-year-old brunner sustained serious injuries , but died of a heart condition brought on by the beating , rather than the injuries themselves .
witness statements also identified him as being the first one to lash out at one of the men , albeit to prevent him from attacking the other youths .
brunner was awarded the german order of merit posthumously for acting as a role model of civil courage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.09.2010 politicians could learn from beethoven , says festival head ilona schmiel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel says beethoven inspires enthusiasm utopia , freedom and international exchange are at the core of this year 's beethovenfest .
beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 06.09.2010 munich residents take courage classes in light of deadly beating großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars in civil courage are held in real train carriages a beating at a train station near munich last year left a man dead and had many people wondering how they would have reacted .
now , a police seminar is providing answers on what to do in a public emergency . the train station in solln , a suburb of munich , is n't particularly noteworthy .
here , the city 's apartment buildings have given way to family homes with gardens .
trains running on just two tracks service solln 's station , which is right next door to an elementary school .
but despite being nondescript , nearly everyone in germany has heard of the solln train station .
it was here that dominik brunner , a 50-year-old business man , was beaten up by two teenagers last september .
he later died in hospital .
brunner had stepped in to stop the teenagers from bullying some young boys , and was praised as a hero for his civil courage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brutal beating at solln shocked the german public but not everyone would have gotten physically involved in the situation .
passengers at the solln station had mixed feelings about how they would have reacted .
" i would think twice , " says one man .
" if someone gets hurt while trying to defend others , and the injuries kept them from working , they would n't get any financial support or a new job , even though they were just trying to help . "
one woman waiting for the train at solln said she would have tried to call the police and at least get the children out of harm 's way .
another man says he would only get involved if he thought he had a physical advantage .
boosting civil courage it 's a difficult hypothetical question to answer , but to help people prepare should they ever become involved in an emergency , police in munich are offering seminars aimed at boosting civil courage .
the seminars are held in the german transportation museum in munich .
among the classic cars , motorcycles and locomotives on display , the museum has an actual train car just like the ones used in munich today .
the two police officers running the course , sandra weiss and sandra dubiel , use the train car to conduct role playing exercises .
after the participants take a seat on a simulated train ride through munich , officer weiss - playing the role of the bad guy - enters the train .
under the friendly pretence of asking an elderly woman for a cigarette lighter , weiss gets the woman to open her purse .
then she steals the woman 's wallet .
weiss walked past all the passengers in the train , but no one reacted , and she was able to exit the train with the stolen property .
ronald wirth , a 46-year-old man from solln , was one of the passengers in the exercise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police want citizens to respond to crime , in whatever way they can " i was aware that someone had been robbed , " says wirth , " but there were just a few seconds where i did n't know how to react .
all these possibilities went through my head but i could n't decide what to do .
then the thief was gone . "
tied by indecision back in her normal role as a police officer , sandra weiss says people generally want to help in these situations , but they freeze up .
" i describe it as being stuck in a holding pattern , " she says .
" people think : ' i need to help .
yes - right - okay , i should help .
but … how ? '
that 's what we 're hoping to address with the course .
we want people to consider ahead of time - what would i do if something happens ? "
a situation can often be defused simply by taking control verbally .
the munich police say just over 68 percent of conflict situations can be stopped verbally .
had the victim of the theft forcefully said ' no !
take your hands out of my purse ! ' rather than passively allowing the thief to search for a cigarette lighter , the situation may have been avoided .
any of the passengers could have also physically restrained the criminal with no legal consequences .
any reaction better than no reaction or course , not everyone is going to be prepared to get physically involved in a confrontation - and police say that protecting your own safety is the most important .
" civil courage just means that a person goes through life with open eyes and does something rather than just look away , " says sandra dubiel , the other officer conducting the course .
" no one has to get physically involved , but anyone can call the police .
the worst thing is to look the other way .
that 's what we do n't want . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when situations arise , commuters often do n't know what to do in addition to learning verbal means of defusing tense situations and alternatives to getting directly involved - such as calling the police - officer dubiel uses sparring gloves to demonstrate some basic self-defense maneuvers in case of a personal attack .
but , she adds , the techniques should only be used to create a chance to escape a dangerous situation , not to win a fight .
when self-defense techniques are used , a confrontation is stopped eighty-four percent of the time a chance to feel prepared at 70 years old , paula stocker says she is n't likely to jump in the middle of a fight , but she takes a swing at the sparring gloves anyway .
she feels like the course has given her tools to react in some way if there was an emergency .
" i feel safer , and more prepared , " stocker says .
" i 'd also be happy if something ever happened to me that the people around me would have these tips ready , too . "
participants in the course are also taught to use aed -lrb- automated external defibrillator -rrb- devices that are often found in public places such as train stations .
an aed can improve a heart attack victim 's chances of survival by delivering an electric shock to the heart to restore normal beating rhythm .
the public interest in civil courage has grown since dominik brunner 's death , and the seminars teaching tips for reacting to any emergency situation - violent or otherwise - are generally booked quickly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 smart grids play key role in modern energy infrastructure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids work on the ' what you can measure , you can manage ' principle how do you ensure a steady supply of electricity from fickle renewable sources such as solar , wind and biomass ?
' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 06.09.2010 politicians could learn from beethoven , says festival head ilona schmiel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel says beethoven inspires enthusiasm utopia , freedom and international exchange are at the core of this year 's beethovenfest .
beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .

the czechs have n't viewed them as fellow countrymen - until recently . most people probably think of composer gustav mahler as an austrian composer - after all , german was his first language .
but the state he was born in has long since disappeared . mahler , the son of a jewish coachman and innkeeper , was born in 1860 in what is now the czech republic , but then was the bohemian region of the austro-hungarian empire .
he and his family would have called their little village kalischt , though the czechs now call it kaliste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz kafka has long been associated with prague gustav mahler is one of a dozen german-speaking personalities being profiled this month at an exhibition at the prager literaturhaus , a czech institute that promotes the city 's german literary heritage . language barrier other household names , like the world 's most famous neurologist , have ties to the region and are included in the exhibition . " sigmund freud stayed here for only three years , but he was so influenced by his surroundings where he grew up , " the institute 's director , lucie cernohousova , said of another well-known local .
" his analysis and his work was influenced by his czech , or moravian roots . "
the moravian region now makes up the eastern portion of the czech republic , while bohemia represents the western part of the country . the exhibition , called " born in bohemia and moravia - but forgotten by us ? " suggests that many czechs have little or no idea that people such as mahler , freud , automobile giant ferdinand porsche , and holocaust hero oskar schindler were born in their country . " obviously , franz kafka is an item for the prague tourist industry , and there are several museums devoted to his memory , " said petr brod , a prague-based journalist with a keen interest in czech-german history .
" with freud , it 's a bit more difficult , but people in moravia probably know that he was born in -lsb- the czech city of -rsb- pribor . " with the others , few people outside of a small circle of czech intellectuals would recognize them as fellow countryman , added brod . changing attitude the exhibition at the prager literaturhaus is the work of wolfgang schwarz , a historian who works for the munich-based adalbert stifter association , which was founded by some of the three million ethnic germans expelled from czechoslovakia after world war ii .
adalbert stifter himself is one of the 12 personalities honored in the exhibition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many ethnic germans left czechoslovakia during or after world war ii schwarz says the czechs are becoming gradually more interested in the german speakers who were born in their lands . " i think a lot 's changed in the last few years , " said schwarz , who speaks czech fluently .
" you can see that by just visiting the towns where these people were born . " he explained that in pribor , the birthplace of sigmund freud , the local authorities have named a street after him and erected a monument to him on the town square . author : rob cameron , prague editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 06.09.2010 smart grids play key role in modern energy infrastructure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids work on the ' what you can measure , you can manage ' principle how do you ensure a steady supply of electricity from fickle renewable sources such as solar , wind and biomass ?
' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

the czechs have n't viewed them as fellow countrymen - until recently . most people probably think of composer gustav mahler as an austrian composer - after all , german was his first language .
but the state he was born in has long since disappeared . mahler , the son of a jewish coachman and innkeeper , was born in 1860 in what is now the czech republic , but then was the bohemian region of the austro-hungarian empire .
he and his family would have called their little village kalischt , though the czechs now call it kaliste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz kafka has long been associated with prague gustav mahler is one of a dozen german-speaking personalities being profiled this month at an exhibition at the prager literaturhaus , a czech institute that promotes the city 's german literary heritage . language barrier other household names , like the world 's most famous neurologist , have ties to the region and are included in the exhibition . " sigmund freud stayed here for only three years , but he was so influenced by his surroundings where he grew up , " the institute 's director , lucie cernohousova , said of another well-known local .
" his analysis and his work was influenced by his czech , or moravian roots . "
the moravian region now makes up the eastern portion of the czech republic , while bohemia represents the western part of the country . the exhibition , called " born in bohemia and moravia - but forgotten by us ? " suggests that many czechs have little or no idea that people such as mahler , freud , automobile giant ferdinand porsche , and holocaust hero oskar schindler were born in their country . " obviously , franz kafka is an item for the prague tourist industry , and there are several museums devoted to his memory , " said petr brod , a prague-based journalist with a keen interest in czech-german history .
" with freud , it 's a bit more difficult , but people in moravia probably know that he was born in -lsb- the czech city of -rsb- pribor . " with the others , few people outside of a small circle of czech intellectuals would recognize them as fellow countryman , added brod . changing attitude the exhibition at the prager literaturhaus is the work of wolfgang schwarz , a historian who works for the munich-based adalbert stifter association , which was founded by some of the three million ethnic germans expelled from czechoslovakia after world war ii .
adalbert stifter himself is one of the 12 personalities honored in the exhibition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many ethnic germans left czechoslovakia during or after world war ii schwarz says the czechs are becoming gradually more interested in the german speakers who were born in their lands . " i think a lot 's changed in the last few years , " said schwarz , who speaks czech fluently .
" you can see that by just visiting the towns where these people were born . " he explained that in pribor , the birthplace of sigmund freud , the local authorities have named a street after him and erected a monument to him on the town square . author : rob cameron , prague editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .
in that time , england fielded an ageing david seaman , david " calamity " james and , in failing to qualifying for the 2008 event , scott carson .
joe harte is latest keeper to take over what has been this thankless task , and at least on paper he represents an improvement insofar as he plays for one of the top sides in premier league , manchester city .
so if england do manage to break their string of failure in poland and ukraine , it will be more down to him than to misguided efforts to make the premier league more english .

those are just two bits of nonsense being spread about soccer 's next big competition . every major sporting event spawns a host of speculation , misconceptions and out-and-out falsehoods - and the 2012 european football championship is no exception .
deutsche welle puts three current ones under the magnifying glass .
games will be moved to poland or maybe even germany a lot of ink has been spilled about ukraine 's lack of infrastructural progress , with some people even surmising that uefa could relocate some matches , perhaps to stadiums in the eastern part of germany .
as welcome as such a scenario might be to german football fans , this is pure wishful thinking .
concerns about a host country 's readiness to host a major sporting event regularly surface when tournaments are held outside the leading industrialized nations .
they were part of the run-up to the 2010 world cup in south africa and even the 2004 summer olympics in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadiums should be ready on time both of those events went ahead exactly as planned , and there 's no reason to expect anything different with ukraine .
indeed , after some familiar initial delays , organizers are already working overtime to ensure nothing - not even the weather - disrupts their schedule .
" what we 're trying to do is build as fast as possible to avoid the winter time , which could start earlier this year , " the portugese director of construction at kiev 's olympic stadium , jitesse arquissandas , told dw-tv .
" that 's why we are starting in october .
so we 're a bit faster than was planned . "
moreover , uefa officials say that even the stadium in lviv - the venue of most concern - is now making adequate progress , and in november of last year , the association confirmed that those two cities , together with donetsk and kharkiv , will be hosting matches .
barring some sort of natural or social catastrophe , that 's the end of the story .
michael ballack to lead germany at the tournament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has been given no guarantees germany coach joachim loew seemed to decide what 's become known as " the captaincy question " in ballack 's favor last week , but a closer look at what he said reveals that only a basic principle has been set in stone .
" at the moment , bastian schweinsteiger and sami khedira are our defensive midfield , " loew told his players ahead of their 1-0 qualifier win over belgium on september 3 .
" but if michael comes back and makes the squad he 'll be captain .
if michael does n't play , philipp -lsb- lahm -rsb- is the captain . "
in other words , ballack 's position in the squad is by no means guaranteed .
his form will have to improve to earn any further call-ups , and he 'll have to supplant one of the two regulars to regain the captain 's armband .
how likely is that ?
lahm , who previously said he was not going to relinquish the german captaincy voluntarily , seemed perfectly happy with the arrangement .
it was a clever way for loew to defuse a potentially disruptive situation , and one that makes it more likely than not that lahm will lead germany onto the pitch in 2012 .
england wo n't win because there are too many foreigners in the premier league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's goalkeeper problems are the stuff of high comedy this was a conclusion lots of people in england drew after the three lions put in yet another underwhelming performance at the world cup .
the english fa has since instituted a rule that all premiership clubs have to include a certain number of english or " home-grown " players in their squads .
but the connection between successful national teams and domestic leagues is practically non-existent .
the percentage of foreigners at the top clubs in spain 's primera division and italy 's serie a has been only slightly smaller in recent years than in the premier league .
nonetheless , those national sides won the last euro and the previous two world cups .
moreover , three of the past five winners - greece in 2004 , france in 2000 and denmark in 1992 - had a majority of legionnaires in their starting teams .
germany , too , won the euro in 1996 after a bundesliga season in which three of the top six scorers were foreigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are prevalent in all of the big european leagues the number of foreign players in the premiership is not what 's holding england back .
what does hurt the three lions is that the league spends less money proportionally on developing young players , especially in those areas - goalkeeping and defense - that are crucial to winning titles .
peter schmeichel , andreas koepke , fabien barthez , antonios nikopolidis and iker casillas were the starting keepers who won the euro since 1992 .

the low turnout has dashed hopes of a resolution to the political deadlock in the country . the moldovan government 's hopes of breaking the country 's political deadlock with legislation to directly elect a president have been dealt a terminal blow .
low voter turnout in a referendum on the matter means that the government could not obtain a mandate for the change to be enacted . just over 29 percent of the electorate voted in the poll .
the figure falls short of the 33 percent required for it to be binding , according to central election commission head yuri cocan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters last year put a pro-western coalition in power dissolution of parliament the referendum 's failure was expected to lead to the dissolution of the parliament and snap elections .
moldova , a former soviet nation sandwiched between ukraine and romania , currently has no president .
the country 's liberal and pro-western coalition government has been unable to obtain the necessary three-fifths majority in parliament to elect one .
the communist party , which held power from 2001 until last year and has a large minority in parliament , claims that the vote is a coalition plot to seize power .
it called for a boycott of the referendum .
recent opinion polls showed that 75 to 90 percent of those who were planning to vote were in favor of direct presidential elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.09.2010 budget cuts are a good pretext for reforming military policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are reducing orders for hardware germany has joined many of its nato allies in drastically cutting its military budget , and even the us is now cautiously mooting defense " efficiencies . "
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

"
is this a response to huge national debts , or a new strategy ? " by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better . "
this is how german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg framed his plans to cut the german army by around a third last month .
a similar refrain has been taken up throughout the nato alliance , where growing state debts are putting increasing pressure on defense budgets , but defense ministers are at pains to ensure that security is not impaired .
british defense secretary liam fox said in july that possible cuts to the country 's nuclear deterrent are being considered , but insisted that any budget trimming must not put britain at risk by weakening its armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg has come under fire for his radical proposals " these are tough economic times , but i am determined to ensure the uk retains robust and well equipped armed forces capable of intervening abroad where necessary to protect our security , " fox said in a speech to london 's chatham house think tank .
cuts across europe similarly , fox 's french counterpart herve morin said last month that his ministry would make about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.92 billion -rrb- in savings up to 2013 to help france bring its public finances under control , while at the same time promising that france 's military presence in afghanistan would be maintained .
the italian military is also facing a 10 percent budget cut by 2011 , though here , as in many other countries , the reductions will take the form of slashing orders for military hardware , notably the eurofighter airplane .
this is obviously due to the new financial constraints that almost all governments are currently subject to .
but henning riecke , program director at the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- , says that financial problems have also come in handy for those keen to see major reforms in germany .
" the driving force behind this development is the financial crisis , and the additional debts that were taken on to keep the crisis under control , " he told deutsche welle .
" but i also think the pressure of this crisis is being used to push through difficult reform decisions that would n't have been possible at other times ; for example the reduction of tank divisions that are not needed anymore , or the closure of military bases in western germany . "
no more iraqs tackling defense spending has been a political taboo in the united states since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , but even there that may be changing , analysts say .
there is a consensus among governments that the us withdrawal from iraq signals a new global situation that requires a new defense strategy .
" we 're about to enter into a glacial shift in thinking about the size of the defense budget .
and the wars are no longer the iron-clad protection that the budget increasers had , " said winslow wheeler , director of the straus military reform project at the center for defense information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is realizing that military intervention does not prevent terrorism nick witney , senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , agrees that a fundamental change is beginning to take hold in nato 's defense strategy .
" europe is much more cautious about the whole idea of liberal interventionism - the policy of ' get out there , tackle the problem of terrorism at source , and make the world a better place , ' is not as persuasive , " he told deutsche welle .
this means that defense ministries in the western world simply have fewer arguments for maintaining their budget .
" if you 're the finance ministry and you say to the defense ministry , ' we need you to drop 20 percent , ' and they say , ' well we ca n't , ' it 's just too easy for the finance ministry to say , ' oh , planning another afghanistan , are you ? " '
witney said .
riecke of the dgap also thinks the iraq and afghanistan experiences mean that the west will be a lot less ambitious about its presence abroad .
" the difficult operations in iraq and afghanistan will lead states to be more cautious about getting into that situation again , " he said .
" i ca n't really imagine that these large-scale operations , which are tied up with state stabilization and continue indefinitely will be undertaken again soon .
afghanistan and iraq are models that we probably wo n't see again for a long time . "
witney agrees .
" the cia chief testified earlier this year that he believes there are about 50 al qaeda operatives in afghanistan , which puts the cost of us intervention there at over a billion dollars per terrorist , " he said .
" they 've all just moved to pakistan or yemen .
rooting out terrorism by military intervention does not work , and in fact we 're learning , or we should have learnt , that it 's counter-productive . "
inefficient armies but many commentators believe the endemic inefficiency of the european military is enough of a reason on its own to justify spending cuts .
riecke says that in one sense , guttenberg is right to say that a smaller army can be more effective , especially if it scraps conscription .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraq war is unlikely to be repeated soon , experts believe " a problem is the small proportion of german soldiers that can be put into operation .
at the moment we have about a quarter of a million soldiers , of whom 10,000 are in operation at the most .
the others are all tied up in other places , in structures that are in principle still stuck in the cold war , such as the training of people in military service , " he said .
" that is why it is certainly possible that if you remove these unnecessary structures , you free up more soldiers to send into active operations .
but equipping these soldiers is a whole other question . "
" between us , we still have the best part of 10,000 battle-tanks in europe , as well as 2,500 aircraft .
who exactly is it that we 're going to fly these aircraft against ? " asked witney .
" across europe there is still a vast amount of waste in defense budgets .
if we all get hit with 15 to 20 percent cuts that does not necessarily mean a 15 to 20 percent cut in useful defense capability , if it 's handled correctly . "
even though the international situation remains unpredictable , it does not mean that making intelligent defense cuts will leave nato unprepared .
in fact , many commentators believe , streamlining the military could make it more adaptable for future conflicts .

nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .

nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .
countries like italy , sweden and finland have all recently introduced similar policies to either extend or expand nuclear power production , while france has a notoriously heavy dependence on atomic energy .
bridging the gap merkel 's government says that the 17 remaining nuclear plants in germany will have to contribute some of their future profits towards the development of the renewable energy sector .
the first contributions are set to be generated by a new , six-year tax on the use of nuclear fuel rods , which the government expects to generate 2.3 billion -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- euros per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , nuclear power companies are meant to help fund renewable energies according to germany 's dpa news agency , merkel held a telephone conference late on sunday with the bosses of nuclear power concerns eon , rwe , enbw and vattenfall , who promised to also voluntarily contribute some of their profits to ecological endeavors .
" of course , we wo n't levy taxes so high that our nuclear plant operators would throw in the towel , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who initially opposed the extension .
" we want these additional revenues , and so it would make little sense to help eliminate the financial source itself . "
however , some energy experts in germany are not convinced that the new levies on the companies will make any meaningful dent in the profits of nuclear energy providers .
" apart from the unresolved security issues , the deal will mainly mean more profits for the utility companies involved , " felix matthes from the freiburg-based ecology research institute told deutsche welle .
" according to our own calculations , these firms will be able to pocket an additional 95 billion euros in profits , with only 15 billion euros expected to go towards climate protection .
so you can hardly talk about a push for renewable energy sources . "
merkel said it was as yet impossible to say when germany would abandon nuclear energy for good , but pledged only to use the technology for as long as it was necessary .
" i know that people are very skeptical and critical of nuclear power , " she said .
" we take these concerns very seriously . "

but not everyone 's convinced . the german government has embarked on a charm offensive , seeking to defend its decision to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants by an average of 12 years .
" i think it 's fair to say that our energy supply scheme will become the world 's most efficient and environmentally friendly , " chancellor angela merkel said in berlin , referring to her center-right coalition 's overall plan to support the introduction of renewable energies by using more old-fashioned , established sources of power in the meantime .
" the agreement will maintain affordable energy prices both for private consumers and businesses .
our aim is to further promote renewables , and we see nuclear and coal-fired power plants as an indispensible bridge towards this goal . "
by 2050 , merkel said , 80 percent of germany 's electricity should be harvested from renewable sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear plants were set to shut down by 2021 " this is a revolution in the energy production sector , no more , no less , " she said .
for now , though , the country 's pre-1980 nuclear power stations will remain online for a further eight years , with the more modern post-1980 ones running for an extra 14 years .
political fallout germany 's social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green opposition parties , who introduced plans to phase out all nuclear power by 2021 when in office at the turn of the century , have pledged to reverse the decision if they win power .
" i can promise the government a fiery autumn , " claudia roth , co-leader of the green party , said in response to the decision .
nuclear energy has always been a particularly contentious issue among the german electorate , with polls showing that a majority of people oppose the power source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atomic energy is unpopular among the german public in an editorial on monday , the major daily paper die welt said merkel " has created an election issue , which the spd and greens will fully exploit in 2011 , " referring to six upcoming state ballots .
nuclear power currently produces almost one-quarter of germany 's electricity .
renewable energy sources make up about 15 percent of the power supply , with the remainder coming from traditional fossil fuels like coal .
atomic energy has regained some of its popularity in many european countries in recent years , due to volatile oil prices and a general desire to reduce the carbon emissions generated by burning fossil fuels , broadly considered the chief contributor to climate change .

the un food and agricultural organization warns of a major shortfall in the seasonal wheat harvest . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- the flood has destroyed more than half a million tons of wheat seed stocks and more than 3 million hectares of standing crops in pakistan like corn , rice , sugarcane and cotton . recently , the fao has called for seeds to be urgently supplied to pakistani farmers for the upcoming wheat planting season between september and november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks by dead cotton crops in punjab province fao fears long term impact four out of five people in the flood-affected areas depend on agriculture for a living , and the affected regions in khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab are the most fertile and productive areas of pakistan .
daniele donati , chief of the fao ’ s special emergency program service , believes it will not only be a short-term problem if wheat can not be planted during this season . he is concerned that the cost of the food aid operation of other agencies of the un will go up , " and we are not sure of being able to provide all this food . "
another problem will be the compensation of the shortfalls during the next season . this might mean " a major modification over the year of the food consumption pattern of pakistan " , donati thinks . flood victims dependent on crop " the wheat crop is the only staple food , staple crop in pakistan " , explains muhammad ibrahim , secretary general of the pakistan agricultural scientists forum -lrb- pas -rrb- .
pakistan 's economy depends upon planting wheat . 20 million people have been affected in this disaster .
" and now it is the problem for us that we have to feed those 20 million people , " adds maqsood ahmad , another board member of the pas .
according to the ministry of food and agriculture , the losses of crops in the flood are estimated to amount to nearly 3 billion us dollars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flooding has destroyed 3.6 million hectares of crops no food security if people in the flood areas can not receive seeds within the next few weeks , they will have nothing to plant , since they are now starting to use their remaining wheat seed stocks to feed their families .
the agricultural sector of pakistan is now facing more dangers because beside the major crops of the country , the flood has killed more than 1 million livestock and around 6 million poultry . donati says that the most urgent thing is to provide the farmers - in the areas where they can resume agricultural activities - with seeds , tools and fertilizers .
" simultaneously , the provision of animal feed " is urgently needed , he claims , " as of now , to save animals represents the saving of the families . "
and the pakistani livestock needs to be saved from diseases . if the pakistani farmers can not plant wheat this season , many of them will not be able to plant for the coming 12 months .
this will be equal to the loss of two harvests and will seriously affect the food security of millions of people . author : pin manika editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 06.09.2010 german court rules against youtube in copyright row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youtube has vowed to fight the ruling internet giant google has suffered a setback after a german court ruled that its subsidiary , youtube , is responsible for videos its users upload in violation of copyright law . a hamburg court ruled on friday that youtube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted material without permission .
the ruling comes as the latest in a series of setbacks for parent company google .
the case relates to a complaint originally filed in october last year and centers around three music videos by classical soprano sarah brightman .
the plaintiffs reportedly asked youtube to take down the videos in question but never received a reply .
the court found that youtube 's standardized question to users about whether they have the necessary rights to publish material is not enough to relieve youtube of the legal responsibility for the content .
it added that the online video platform must not allow the videos in question to be republished , and must disclose how often users accessed them and pay damages based on those figures .
youtube to fight ruling henning dorstewitz , a spokesman for youtube in hamburg , said in an interview with bloomberg that the company will appeal the ruling .
parent company google said the court 's decision sent the wrong signal .
" this decision results in a substantial legal uncertainty for all providers of video platforms , opinion forums , social communities , blogs and many other internet services in germany , " arnd haller , director of legal affairs at google germany , said in a statement .
haller added that the court ruling also disregards a current e-commerce directive of the european union .
can youtube be held liable ?
for youtube , the bigger issue is whether a user-generated content platform can be held legally responsible for the materials uploaded by its users .
friday 's ruling comes after the same court earlier declined to issue an injunction forcing google to block german access on youtube in a separate dispute with gema , the german artists ' representation agency .
the group had sued youtube , calling for the immediate removal of videos it said infringed on copyrights held by its composers and songwriters .
" it 's the same court and at the core , they are similar cases , about the liability of youtube , " dorstewitz told bloomberg .
but experts say whether a user-generated online portal can be held responsible for its content depends on a few factors and can only be decided on a case for case basis .
" a platform that allows its users to upload content can only be made liable when it treats the content as its own , " mario rehse , copyright expert at germany 's bitkom , the industry association for information technology and new media , told deutsche welle .
" that means that the content , which is actually externally generated , is appropriated so that it appears as its own to the users , " rehse said .
that is true in cases where platform owners put their own logo on the content or where content is tweaked editorially before being published online , rehse said , citing a ruling by the german federal administrative court . google in legal hot water the german copyright case against youtube is just one of a string of legal challenges facing google both in europe and the us amid growing concerns about privacy infringements and the power the online business yields .
regulators in texas this week launched the first broad anti-trust review of google 's search and advertising practices in the us .
the internet giant stands accused of manipulating search rankings of lesser-known rivals .
the european union has launched several anti-trust probes into google in the past .
in germany , the internet service faces harsh criticism amid privacy concerns over its street view online mapping service .
google also recently paid $ 8.5 million -lrb- 6.6 million euros -rrb- to settle a class action lawsuit in the us over its buzz social networking service and alleged privacy violations .

chief minister nitish kumar insisted that there had been no deal with the rebels . firecrackers bursted and drums were played .
it was festival time for the families of the policemen as their long and agonising wait came to an end .
hundreds of people gathered outside the police station in lakhisarai town , 175 kms from the state capital , to have a glimpse of the three surviving police officers who were abducted more than a week ago by maoist rebels during a gun battle that left one policemen dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bihar chief minister nitish kumar under pressure the release came two days after the insurgents killed another police officer they had kidnapped , demanding that the bihar state government free eight of their fighters .
the state government rejected their demand but offered the rebel leaders safe passage if they agreed to talks .
soon after the release , chief minister nitish kumar , who was under severe pressure to begin negotiations with the rebels invited them to enter the election fray .
bihar goes to polls in november . already 450 victims this year the simmering civil war between the maoist revolutionaries and the state has been brutal on both sides .
but the government ’ s tough line has not yielded dividends .
in fact , it is the maoists that seem to be gaining the upper hand at present , carrying out their acts of destruction - killing security personnel and blowing up railway lines - with impunity while the government appears helpless .
as many as 450 people were killed in the first six months of this year alone .
bildunterschrift : indian security forces guard the spot of a maoist attack earlier this year the communist party of india - marxist - are battling the maoist rebels in parts of west bengal .
their leader sitaram yechuri says the movement feeds off land disputes : " as long as the social inequities and basically the question of land are not addressed in major parts of the country , you will have a fertile basis for such movements to continue to develop and grow .
so it has to be a combination of both : a law and order approach as well as an approach towards solving the social problems . " " crush rebels " security analyst ajay sahni supports the use of force to fight the maoist rebels .
the example of the southern state of andhra pradesh shows that it is possible to crush the rebels , he says .
" in andhra pradesh , it was not these small targeted special operations , not these few battalions of central forces sent in , it was a complete reinvention of the state policing system : an empowerment of the police station in every affected area across the state . " there was not a single police station which was not fortified , empowered , provided adequate force , technology , arms , communication , transport and a mandate .
and then they went in and wiped the maoists out . " others maintain that the security forces have failed to contain the rebels because they have never faced an ideologically driven rebellion in the forested regions in the heart of the country .
all the other uprisings have been in peripheral areas , whether in the northeast or in kashmir .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "
customers needed it 's expected that in two years , germany 's model regions will have developed their smart energy concepts to the point where they 'll be ready for the market and everyday use .
this summer , project organizers set up a model house complete with washing machine , refrigerator and an electric car .
the latter plays a key role in the project - both to store electricity as well as consume it .
still missing are the thousands of electricity consumers needed to test the whole thing .
" the most important thing is that the customers play along because you ca n't have a smart grid without customers , " said joern kroeplin from the energy utility firm enbw , which is involved in the project .
kroeplin says it is important to find tariffs and models that will create the necessary incentives .
" we also need the necessary appliances that customers accept and use .
without all that , it wo n't work , " he said .
not all smooth sailing a first intelligent washing machine manufactured by german company miele was on display at this year 's consumer electronics fair ifa in berlin .
it switches on when the electricity price falls below a certain level .
but it also needs a smart plug which recognizes what the electricity currently costs .
for smart grids to work , a number of players will need to come together , including industrial and private consumers , to help share the introductory costs .
another obstacle remains .
aside from their upfront costs , smart meters also use a lot of energy to maintain , due to all the data flows operating in real time .
the required internet connection alone , which runs 24/7 , uses over 100 kilowatt hours of electricity in a year – almost exactly as much as a modern refrigerator .

' smart grids ' that manage and distribute flows of electricity could be the answer . the eu 's ambitious goals of a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency , a 20 percent increase in renewables and a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions - all by the year 2020 - are a huge undertaking .
experts agree that none of the " 20:20:20 " goals are achievable without a functional smart grid that ultimately optimizes energy generation .
that 's because simply building more wind plants and solar collectors wo n't be enough , as renewable energy is hampered by the fact that it 's not constantly available – after all , if the wind does n't blow or the sun does n't shine , wind turbines or solar cells do n't generate energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the biggest drawback of renewables is that it 's not constantly available ' smart grids ' on the other hand can manage and distribute intermittent energy supply from small power plants , wind mills or solar systems without a hitch , leading to a steady supply of electricity .
if there 's too much electricity in the grid , it can be stored in batteries , for example when an electric car rolls up to a recharging point .
smart energy draws big players smart grids provide utilities with the information and flexibility required to manage intermittent electricity supply from renewable and micro-generation sources , allowing them to balance this with more traditional , consistent supply .
large companies such as switzerland 's abb , a rival of germany 's engineering giant siemens , say smart grids are a huge trend in the energy sector .
" there are lots of solutions that are already available .
we could begin with them right away , " peter smits , the head of abb europe said .
but smits says incentives , like feed in tariffs , are still needed to encourage the switch to a bigger pool of renewable energy sources .
" the more renewable energy we have to feed in the network , the more the utilities and electricity distributors are going to need this solution , " smits said .
the international energy agency estimates that by 2030 , worldwide investments worth several trillion dollars will be needed for modern energy generation and new electricity networks .
indeed , the booming market , which promises lucrative returns , has attracted new players to the utilities sector , including it giants such as google , ibm , cisco , microsoft or telecommunications firms such as deutsche telekom .
various smart approaches from the use of smart meters in households in italy or france , to government-backed pilot-projects in the us , there 's a growing momentum for groundbreaking smart energy schemes .
in germany , too , the government is trialing smart grids in a few hand-picked regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart grids provide utilities with improved data for distribution to the network the impression that germany is lagging behind on smart energy projects is not true , says hartmut schmeck from the institute for technology in karlsruhe .
he says selected regions in germany are testing the entire supply chain - from electricity generation , and distribution to supplying the end consumer .
" other countries are trying out projects where individual processes are monitored .
but comprehensive , holistic approaches like the ones in germany - they do n't exist elsewhere . "

beethoven has a particular power that brings people together , says the festival 's director ilona schmiel . each year , beethoven 's birth city of bonn hosts a month-long festival celebrating the composer 's music and its continuing impact .
beethovenfest begins on september 10 , 2010 .
this year 's festival takes place under the motto " into the open " and features innovative concert formats that relate to the theme of utopia and freedom in music .
beethovenfest director ilona schmiel talked with deutsche welle about this year 's event and its international dimensions .
deutsche welle : what does the festival motto - " into the open " - mean ?
ilona schmiel : the phrase comes from an elegy by -lsb- german poet friedrich -rsb- hoelderlin written in 1800 , and this is also the time period we 're exploring with this year 's festival .
part of how we 're doing that is by presenting music from beethoven 's era , which was marked by a social shift toward egalitarianism .
we 're also looking ahead and asking what the music of the 21st century will be like and how contemporary composers can be integrated into our program .
since utopia and freedom in music relate to the festival 's theme , we will investigate utopia in the form of two examples from south america .
other countries will also come into focus by way of two films on the west-eastern divan orchestra and the kinshasa symphony .
do you think the romantic or utopian idea of music is represented more in countries that do n't belong to the so-called " western " world ?
that concept is experienced there more strongly because the environment is different .
here in western europe , we 're sometimes too complacent to really appreciate the power of music and the passion to fight through difficult living conditions .
music can integrate people and take on meaning that we often do n't appreciate enough in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with rock band bakkushan and other acts , the festival goes beyond classical music what steps are you taking to expand the audience for the beethovenfest ?
we looked for artists that ask themselves how to address audiences of the future , regardless of age .
i think multi-percussionist martin grubinger is a good example of what i mean .
he and six other musicians are going to give an unbelievably exciting concert .
they 'll create a surround-sound effect in the beethovenhalle in bonn by performing on six stages simultaneously .
we 've had a lot of discussions about how to get young people involved and what they expect from a festival .
i have a co-director at my side who is 16 , and she 's in charge of a project featuring a competition between a " baroque band " with violinist daniel hope and a rock band called bakkushan .
is there a good network and exchange among beethoven festivals , or is it more of a competitive situation ?
it 's more of a network than a competition .
we have good exchange with the beethoven festivals in warsaw and caracas .
in 2004 , i traveled to caracas and made contact with jose antonio abreu , the founder of the national network of youth and children 's orchestras of venezuela .
this year , he is serving as patron of the beethovenfest .
i can not imagine anyone that would fit better with this year 's theme of utopia in music than dr. abreu .
what makes him stand out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teresa carreno youth orchestra has 200 members thirty-six years ago , he realized that music can be used to help socialize an entire country and looked for projects that can show our audience just how that takes place .
viewing society , culture and the educational canon together came about out of necessity in some countries , but that can be a model for us .
i think it 's a big mistake that , particularly in germany , we view these three areas as being so distinct from each other .
we are bringing the enormous teresa carreno youth orchestra from venezuela for this year 's festival .
just the size of the ensemble is amazing to see , and the enthusiasm that emanates from the stage is a kind of fundamental experience .
i expected their concert to sell out , but i never thought it would sell out as quickly as it did .
the beethovenfest bonn has already had exchanges with many countries .
what international partnerships are planned in the future ?
beethoven plays such a big role everywhere in the world .
in 2013 , we 're planning a " beethoven satellite , " and there will definitely be further concerts in brazil .
i think it would be a good idea for the government in germany to get behind music .
beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

beethoven does n't have to be viewed as something very traditional but rather as a figure that inspires a lot of enthusiasm and that is imbued with a very particular power .
i think that could be drawn upon in national politics .
for instance , our festival was much more successful in the media in sao paulo than either our finance or foreign ministers , and there are good reasons for that .
i think that with this positive approach and innovative ideas , a lot can be done to bring people together .

talking pictures is the brain child of celebrity photographer cambridge jones , and the welsh assembly government .
jones was born in llanidloes and says he has always wanted to give something back to wales .
the exhibition will show from tuesday 7 september until 25 october and then tour internationally .

he has gone from strength to strength and can count four british prime ministers , the queen , al pacino , sir anthony hopkins , and ioan gruffudd -lrb- pictured -rrb- amongst his long list of clients .
" since face the music , i have always had it in my mind to do something similar for wales " , he said .
" for me it is about having pride in something which sometimes encounters prejudice .
" i have encountered prejudice myself - the usual jokes about welsh people .

together , brace and jones came up with the idea of taking portraits of creative people who are connected to wales in some way .
the photographs are accompanied by interview clips of the subjects talking about who most inspired them .
jones himself was greatly influenced by david bailey , and is known for capturing his subjects as people , not as celebrities .
" i never research my subjects .
i meet them and start a conversation as if i 'd just met them on the bus " , he said .
" that way the conversation is very real .
i have n't elevated them , and we can work together as equals . "
jones also does n't plan his shoots .
in the case of robert plant 's portrait , they agreed to meet in a village in worcestershire .
whilst driving there jones spotted a rusty barn , and decided to do the shoot there .
talking heads features some obvious choices - bryn terfel , dame shirley bassey , cerys matthews , matthew rhys , ioan gruffudd and michael sheen to name but a few , but brace and jones have gone out of their way to include a few surprises .
" i want people to leave the exhibition with a sense of awe at the amazing talent that comes out of this small country " , said jones .
" there is a value and a currency to wales , and that 's what i want to show " .
