in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 24.02.2010 reactions to the ceasefire offer by india 's maoists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maoist rebels are active in 20 of india 's 28 states india 's maoist guerrillas have offered to call a 72-day ceasefire and engage in talks with the government if new delhi halts its military offensive against them .
however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

revised figures show the country has breached eu deficit rules for the first time since 2005 . newly released data from the federal statistics office showed that state spending , boosted by efforts to fighting the economic and financial crisis , pushed the deficit to 79.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 107.2 billion -rrb- .
that 's 3.3 percent of gross domestic product .
this means germany has overstepping the budget-deficit limits set for eu countries by the maastricht treaty at 3 percent of gdp for the first time since 2005 .

statistics for 2009 first published in january had shown a deficit of 77.2 billion euros , or 3.2 percent of gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 24.02.2010 china artists protest forced eviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people protesting against forced evictions in beijing about 20 artists protested in central beijing on monday over the demolition of an art zone in the east of the capital .
the state media reported the protestors were carrying posters reading " civil rights ! " and " capital beijing , brutal demolition " .
rights activists say the police confiscated the posters and stopped them from reaching tiananmen square to hold the demonstration . the artists say they took to the streets after scores of masked men assaulted some of the artists in an attempt to forcibly evict them from their studios .
they claim the men were sent by real estate developers .
among those seriously injured were wu yuren , a 39 year old a photographer , satoshi iwama , a japanese artist and artist liu yi who received 16 stitches after a blow to the head .
" the leader of gang took away my cell phone and instructed his four or five men to beat me with wooden planks and iron bars , " recalls liu yi .
" how i finally ended up on the ground , i can not remember . "
developers and the authorities over a dozen artists ' villages such as zhengyang are facing demolition in beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .
this comes despite the fact that they have signed leases of 20-30 years with developers .
in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .
" it 's all about money .
they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .

the state media reported the protestors were carrying posters reading " civil rights ! " and " capital beijing , brutal demolition " .
rights activists say the police confiscated the posters and stopped them from reaching tiananmen square to hold the demonstration . the artists say they took to the streets after scores of masked men assaulted some of the artists in an attempt to forcibly evict them from their studios .
they claim the men were sent by real estate developers .
among those seriously injured were wu yuren , a 39 year old a photographer , satoshi iwama , a japanese artist and artist liu yi who received 16 stitches after a blow to the head .
" the leader of gang took away my cell phone and instructed his four or five men to beat me with wooden planks and iron bars , " recalls liu yi .
" how i finally ended up on the ground , i can not remember . "
developers and the authorities over a dozen artists ' villages such as zhengyang are facing demolition in beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .
this comes despite the fact that they have signed leases of 20-30 years with developers .
in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .
" it 's all about money .
they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .

top german protestant bishop caught drunk driving she is my kind of bishop .
we need more like her . - alan garfield , great britain bishop margot has proved she is human with all its faults .
but when you head-up such an organization is not more expected of you ?
go back to the bible , and see the qualities required of such leaders and reconsider your position with dignity and do n't wait for the embarrassment for all of calls for your resignation .
leaders are always under attack so i would call for every christian to pray for her and for the church she heads . - john robinson , spain the bishop made a mistake - she admits it , the public prosecutor will indubitably prosecute her under the law and she will plead guilty .
the likely penalty is a 30-day sentence and a year 's driving ban .
the suggestion that she should resign is ridiculous .
she shows that she is human !
good ! - richard spencer , great britain the russian orthodox church is right : a female priest in a christian church is against all traditions and scriptures .
luther would not have approved !
she is right to be against the german involvement in afghanistan but wrong to drive in a drunken state .
luther was not against enjoying a good drink ! - krapotkin , us germany urges catholic church to come clean on child abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaessmann has been criticized by the russian orthodox church for being unsuitable please have a party investigate and not just rely on the church to " come clean . "
self reporting does not report everything .
the german church will needs outside investigation to avoid cover-ups .
in the us the catholic church self-reported to the john jay study .
grand jury investigations in philadelphia revealed a different picture than the john jay report because people outside the hierarchy of the church did the investigation . - aline frybarger , us the sex abuse crimes committed by members of the catholic church throughout the western world , and not prosecuted to the full extent of the law , clearly show that our so-called secular democracies are just a farce and mockery .
when a church recognizes through a statement of their own " ... that significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety and young people ... " involved in church-led activities , it also clearly shows that theocratic centralism -lrb- through the vatican and its subordinates -rrb- must be eliminated for the safety of a country and its people .
i recommend that all services of the catholic church be suspended until a full investigation is completed . - hans reuther-fix , antigua the church has worked very hard to hide the scandal regarding sex abuse by priests .
they have spent huge sums of money for lawyers and public relations firms to help them in their cover-up .
their actions have been extremely un-christian . - charles reisz , us these priests are worse than so-called " ordinary pedophiles , " because they call themselves men of god .
they are hypocrites and should not only be kicked out of the church for good , but should also serve some time in prison , and their details kept on file so that they can never apply again to another church , somewhere else , in the future . - karen j. hardman , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .

" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesperson for italy 's largest environmental organization legambiente called the spill " an unparalleled ecological disaster " and said the consequences would be present in the ecosystem for a long time . italian officials said the spill was caused by intentional sabotage at an oil depot , where vandals opened the cisterns , allowing some 2.5 million liters -lrb- 660,000 gallons -rrb- of oil to flow into the lambro river . the cisterns " were opened by someone who was familiar with the plant and knew how to operate them , " cinzia secchi , a spokeswoman for the local government in milan told ap .
the northern italian city is connected to the po river through a series of channels . from bad to worse after overtaking three separate barriers created to obstruct the flow , the stream of sludge spilled into the po .
the po , which runs through several important italian cities , including turin and piacenza , is a source of irrigation for the country . environmental experts warn of impending havoc if the spill is not soon contained .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

the state media reported the protestors were carrying posters reading " civil rights ! " and " capital beijing , brutal demolition " .
rights activists say the police confiscated the posters and stopped them from reaching tiananmen square to hold the demonstration . the artists say they took to the streets after scores of masked men assaulted some of the artists in an attempt to forcibly evict them from their studios .
they claim the men were sent by real estate developers .
among those seriously injured were wu yuren , a 39 year old a photographer , satoshi iwama , a japanese artist and artist liu yi who received 16 stitches after a blow to the head .
" the leader of gang took away my cell phone and instructed his four or five men to beat me with wooden planks and iron bars , " recalls liu yi .
" how i finally ended up on the ground , i can not remember . "
developers and the authorities over a dozen artists ' villages such as zhengyang are facing demolition in beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .
this comes despite the fact that they have signed leases of 20-30 years with developers .
in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .
" it 's all about money .
they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .
" this is an issue of dignity , " says wu yuren .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .
this comes despite the fact that they have signed leases of 20-30 years with developers .
in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .
" it 's all about money .
they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .

obama had said he would close the prison by january 22 , 2010 , yet the deadline passed unmet .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '

washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 24.02.2010 cartel authority faces payback after court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonn-based federal cartel authority has been reined in by the court decision the german federal cartel authority may have to pay back millions of euros to major companies after a state court ruled it has been setting fines too high for the past three years . judges at the higher regional court in dusseldorf have ruled that the fine structure employed by the federal cartel authority needs to be amended , according to a report by the financial daily newspaper handelsblatt .
as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .

they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .

members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .

' a turkish court has formally charged and jailed seven senior turkish military officers for allegedly plotting to overthrow the islamic-leaning government back in 2003 .
the european commission said it was concerned about the " serious allegations " of coup plotting , and called for ankara to run fair trials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan 's akp party wants the army out of politics " turkish citizens are entitled to hear the entire truth on these cases , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner stefan fule said .
" that 's why the investigation must be exemplary and carried out in full respect of the principles and standards of a fair judicial process . "
fanning the flames the wiretap evidence and discovery of alleged military plans drafted in 2003 to overthrow the government led to the detention of about 50 commanders monday .
a court in istanbul ordered that four admirals , an army general and two staff colonels be jailed .
the controversial probe has fanned tensions in the already polarized country , dramatically escalating tensions between the military-backed secular establishment , and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp party .
the akp , which came to power in 2002 , is the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement .
monday 's arrests prompted an emergency meeting tuesday of the army 's four-star generals and admirals to discuss the " serious situation , " a brief army statement said .
bid to discredit the army ?
akp supporters say the army , which has unseated four governments and has traditionally wielded heavy political influence , must be forced to stop meddling in politics .
but opponents charge the akp is using the guise of democratization to discredit the army , seen as the bulwark of the secular system .
the purported coup plot , codenamed " operation sledgehammer " , was allegedly drawn up in 2003 at the istanbul-based first army , shortly after the akp came to power. jen / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we reached an agreement in principle between the seven nations in the project and eads , " said carme chacon , referring to the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of a400m manufacturer airbus .
" the airbus project will be a success for europe . "
chacon did not give any details as to how the countries would resolve the financing dispute surrounding the late and over-budget project , but added that more information would be released on thursday , following an eu defense meeting in mallorca .
chronic delays the announcement is the latest in the ongoing saga of europe 's much delayed airbus project .
the eads has been trying for months to secure the future of the a400m turboprop transport plane , haggling with the seven countries that ordered the planes over who should pay for the costly overruns that have put the program almost four years behind schedule .
eads chief executive louis gallois and airbus ceo thomas enders had threatened to scrap the project altogether if the buyer nations did not agree to take on some of the extra costs .
the total costs were initially set at 20 billion euros , but have now risen to an estimated 27.6 billion euros , making it europe 's biggest arms project .
most of the planes are slated for delivery to germany .
the other buyer nations are britain , france , belgium , spain , luxembourg and turkey. smh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we reached an agreement in principle between the seven nations in the project and eads , " said carme chacon , referring to the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of a400m manufacturer airbus .
" the airbus project will be a success for europe . "
chacon did not give any details as to how the countries would resolve the financing dispute surrounding the late and over-budget project , but added that more information would be released on thursday , following an eu defense meeting in mallorca .
chronic delays the announcement is the latest in the ongoing saga of europe 's much delayed airbus project .
the eads has been trying for months to secure the future of the a400m turboprop transport plane , haggling with the seven countries that ordered the planes over who should pay for the costly overruns that have put the program almost four years behind schedule .
eads chief executive louis gallois and airbus ceo thomas enders had threatened to scrap the project altogether if the buyer nations did not agree to take on some of the extra costs .
the total costs were initially set at 20 billion euros , but have now risen to an estimated 27.6 billion euros , making it europe 's biggest arms project .
most of the planes are slated for delivery to germany .
the other buyer nations are britain , france , belgium , spain , luxembourg and turkey. smh / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' a turkish court has formally charged and jailed seven senior turkish military officers for allegedly plotting to overthrow the islamic-leaning government back in 2003 .
the european commission said it was concerned about the " serious allegations " of coup plotting , and called for ankara to run fair trials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan 's akp party wants the army out of politics " turkish citizens are entitled to hear the entire truth on these cases , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner stefan fule said .
" that 's why the investigation must be exemplary and carried out in full respect of the principles and standards of a fair judicial process . "
fanning the flames the wiretap evidence and discovery of alleged military plans drafted in 2003 to overthrow the government led to the detention of about 50 commanders monday .
a court in istanbul ordered that four admirals , an army general and two staff colonels be jailed .
the controversial probe has fanned tensions in the already polarized country , dramatically escalating tensions between the military-backed secular establishment , and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp party .
the akp , which came to power in 2002 , is the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement .
monday 's arrests prompted an emergency meeting tuesday of the army 's four-star generals and admirals to discuss the " serious situation , " a brief army statement said .
bid to discredit the army ?
akp supporters say the army , which has unseated four governments and has traditionally wielded heavy political influence , must be forced to stop meddling in politics .
but opponents charge the akp is using the guise of democratization to discredit the army , seen as the bulwark of the secular system .
the purported coup plot , codenamed " operation sledgehammer " , was allegedly drawn up in 2003 at the istanbul-based first army , shortly after the akp came to power. jen / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 24.02.2010 reactions to the ceasefire offer by india 's maoists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maoist rebels are active in 20 of india 's 28 states india 's maoist guerrillas have offered to call a 72-day ceasefire and engage in talks with the government if new delhi halts its military offensive against them .
however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 24.02.2010 reactions to the ceasefire offer by india 's maoists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maoist rebels are active in 20 of india 's 28 states india 's maoist guerrillas have offered to call a 72-day ceasefire and engage in talks with the government if new delhi halts its military offensive against them .
however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .

she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
top german protestant bishop caught drunk driving she is my kind of bishop .
we need more like her . - alan garfield , great britain bishop margot has proved she is human with all its faults .
but when you head-up such an organization is not more expected of you ?
go back to the bible , and see the qualities required of such leaders and reconsider your position with dignity and do n't wait for the embarrassment for all of calls for your resignation .
leaders are always under attack so i would call for every christian to pray for her and for the church she heads . - john robinson , spain the bishop made a mistake - she admits it , the public prosecutor will indubitably prosecute her under the law and she will plead guilty .
the likely penalty is a 30-day sentence and a year 's driving ban .
the suggestion that she should resign is ridiculous .
she shows that she is human !
good ! - richard spencer , great britain the russian orthodox church is right : a female priest in a christian church is against all traditions and scriptures .
luther would not have approved !
she is right to be against the german involvement in afghanistan but wrong to drive in a drunken state .
luther was not against enjoying a good drink ! - krapotkin , us germany urges catholic church to come clean on child abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaessmann has been criticized by the russian orthodox church for being unsuitable please have a party investigate and not just rely on the church to " come clean . "
self reporting does not report everything .
the german church will needs outside investigation to avoid cover-ups .
in the us the catholic church self-reported to the john jay study .

the move shows madrid 's support of us efforts to close the controversial prison . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba said the first inmate from the us prison at guantanamo bay had arrived in his country .
madrid has agreed to host five prisoners , the largest commitment yet from a european country .
citing privacy concerns , rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner 's name or any identifying information , except to say he was a palestinian .
the new arrival will be able to work and move around spain as he wishes , but will not be able to leave the country .
" he is a palestinian , he has already arrived in our country .
we do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally , " he told a news conference .
spain urges others to ' do the utmost ' spain 's decision to take five guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help us president barack obama with his plans to shut down the jail .
the prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , was set up at a us navy base by former president george w. bush in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos has urged other european countries " to do their utmost " to take in former guantanamo detainees as well .
third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges , but who ca n't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution .
obama had said he would close the prison by january 22 , 2010 , yet the deadline passed unmet .
some 200 detainees remain there , but finding places to take in the prisoners - even the dozens already cleared for release - has proved controversial. jen / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state media reported the protestors were carrying posters reading " civil rights ! " and " capital beijing , brutal demolition " .
rights activists say the police confiscated the posters and stopped them from reaching tiananmen square to hold the demonstration . the artists say they took to the streets after scores of masked men assaulted some of the artists in an attempt to forcibly evict them from their studios .
they claim the men were sent by real estate developers .
among those seriously injured were wu yuren , a 39 year old a photographer , satoshi iwama , a japanese artist and artist liu yi who received 16 stitches after a blow to the head .
" the leader of gang took away my cell phone and instructed his four or five men to beat me with wooden planks and iron bars , " recalls liu yi .
" how i finally ended up on the ground , i can not remember . "
developers and the authorities over a dozen artists ' villages such as zhengyang are facing demolition in beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .
this comes despite the fact that they have signed leases of 20-30 years with developers .
in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .
" it 's all about money .
they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .
" this is an issue of dignity , " says wu yuren .
" everyone has the right to live with dignity , but there have been attempts to take that dignity away from us . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

revised figures show the country has breached eu deficit rules for the first time since 2005 . newly released data from the federal statistics office showed that state spending , boosted by efforts to fighting the economic and financial crisis , pushed the deficit to 79.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 107.2 billion -rrb- .
that 's 3.3 percent of gross domestic product .
this means germany has overstepping the budget-deficit limits set for eu countries by the maastricht treaty at 3 percent of gdp for the first time since 2005 .
hard hit by stimulus spending the deficit-limit rule is aimed at securing the stability of the euro currency .
statistics for 2009 first published in january had shown a deficit of 77.2 billion euros , or 3.2 percent of gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

a test showed her blood alcohol level to be 0.154 percent , three times the legal limit for driving in germany , prosecutors said .
" i am shocked at myself for committing such a grievous error , " kaessmann had told bild newspaper .
" i am aware how dangerous and irresponsible it is to drink and drive .
i will accept the legal consequences . "
she will face criminal proceedings for drunk driving , which could include a fine of one month 's salary and loss of driving privileges for up to a year , prosecutors said .

when a church recognizes through a statement of their own " ... that significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety and young people ... " involved in church-led activities , it also clearly shows that theocratic centralism -lrb- through the vatican and its subordinates -rrb- must be eliminated for the safety of a country and its people .
i recommend that all services of the catholic church be suspended until a full investigation is completed . - hans reuther-fix , antigua the church has worked very hard to hide the scandal regarding sex abuse by priests .
they have spent huge sums of money for lawyers and public relations firms to help them in their cover-up .
their actions have been extremely un-christian . - charles reisz , us these priests are worse than so-called " ordinary pedophiles , " because they call themselves men of god .
they are hypocrites and should not only be kicked out of the church for good , but should also serve some time in prison , and their details kept on file so that they can never apply again to another church , somewhere else , in the future . - karen j. hardman , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said .

" syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 24.02.2010 reactions to the ceasefire offer by india 's maoists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maoist rebels are active in 20 of india 's 28 states india 's maoist guerrillas have offered to call a 72-day ceasefire and engage in talks with the government if new delhi halts its military offensive against them .
however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
top german protestant bishop caught drunk driving she is my kind of bishop .
we need more like her . - alan garfield , great britain bishop margot has proved she is human with all its faults .
but when you head-up such an organization is not more expected of you ?
go back to the bible , and see the qualities required of such leaders and reconsider your position with dignity and do n't wait for the embarrassment for all of calls for your resignation .
leaders are always under attack so i would call for every christian to pray for her and for the church she heads . - john robinson , spain the bishop made a mistake - she admits it , the public prosecutor will indubitably prosecute her under the law and she will plead guilty .
the likely penalty is a 30-day sentence and a year 's driving ban .
the suggestion that she should resign is ridiculous .
she shows that she is human !
good ! - richard spencer , great britain the russian orthodox church is right : a female priest in a christian church is against all traditions and scriptures .
luther would not have approved !
she is right to be against the german involvement in afghanistan but wrong to drive in a drunken state .
luther was not against enjoying a good drink ! - krapotkin , us germany urges catholic church to come clean on child abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaessmann has been criticized by the russian orthodox church for being unsuitable please have a party investigate and not just rely on the church to " come clean . "
self reporting does not report everything .
the german church will needs outside investigation to avoid cover-ups .
in the us the catholic church self-reported to the john jay study .
grand jury investigations in philadelphia revealed a different picture than the john jay report because people outside the hierarchy of the church did the investigation . - aline frybarger , us the sex abuse crimes committed by members of the catholic church throughout the western world , and not prosecuted to the full extent of the law , clearly show that our so-called secular democracies are just a farce and mockery .
when a church recognizes through a statement of their own " ... that significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety and young people ... " involved in church-led activities , it also clearly shows that theocratic centralism -lrb- through the vatican and its subordinates -rrb- must be eliminated for the safety of a country and its people .
i recommend that all services of the catholic church be suspended until a full investigation is completed . - hans reuther-fix , antigua the church has worked very hard to hide the scandal regarding sex abuse by priests .
they have spent huge sums of money for lawyers and public relations firms to help them in their cover-up .
their actions have been extremely un-christian . - charles reisz , us these priests are worse than so-called " ordinary pedophiles , " because they call themselves men of god .
they are hypocrites and should not only be kicked out of the church for good , but should also serve some time in prison , and their details kept on file so that they can never apply again to another church , somewhere else , in the future . - karen j. hardman , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

police had caught her driving drunk . the head of the lutheran church in germany , margot kaessmann , announced her resignation at a press conference on wednesday after being pulled over for drunk driving days before .
" one of my advisers said stick to what your heart tells you to do , " kaessmann told reporters .
" and my heart tells me clearly that i can not stay in office without losing much of the authority i 'd need for the post . "
her resignation as head of germany 's protestants and hanover 's bishop is effective immediately , but she will remain a pastor in the local hanover church . kaessmann 's decision to resign came despite a vote of confidence from fellow protestant leaders . police had stopped the 51-year-old , who was driving a car provided by the church , for running a red light in hanover on saturday night .
a test showed her blood alcohol level to be 0.154 percent , three times the legal limit for driving in germany , prosecutors said .
" i am shocked at myself for committing such a grievous error , " kaessmann had told bild newspaper .
" i am aware how dangerous and irresponsible it is to drink and drive .
i will accept the legal consequences . "
she will face criminal proceedings for drunk driving , which could include a fine of one month 's salary and loss of driving privileges for up to a year , prosecutors said .
historic election kaessmann was elected in october 2009 to be the first woman to head the protestant church in germany , an umbrella organization that unites germany 's 25 million protestant christians . she was a controversial choice , because she was divorced .
kaessmann was viewed as a modernizer and a supporter of improving ties with catholics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 24.02.2010 reactions to the ceasefire offer by india 's maoists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maoist rebels are active in 20 of india 's 28 states india 's maoist guerrillas have offered to call a 72-day ceasefire and engage in talks with the government if new delhi halts its military offensive against them .
however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

the move shows madrid 's support of us efforts to close the controversial prison . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba said the first inmate from the us prison at guantanamo bay had arrived in his country .
madrid has agreed to host five prisoners , the largest commitment yet from a european country .
citing privacy concerns , rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner 's name or any identifying information , except to say he was a palestinian .
the new arrival will be able to work and move around spain as he wishes , but will not be able to leave the country .
" he is a palestinian , he has already arrived in our country .
we do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally , " he told a news conference .
spain urges others to ' do the utmost ' spain 's decision to take five guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help us president barack obama with his plans to shut down the jail .
the prison at guantanamo bay , cuba , was set up at a us navy base by former president george w. bush in the wake of the sept .

spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos has urged other european countries " to do their utmost " to take in former guantanamo detainees as well .
third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges , but who ca n't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution .
obama had said he would close the prison by january 22 , 2010 , yet the deadline passed unmet .

germany was in second place after the third of the four legs , but anchor andrea henkel was unable to keep up the pace on the approach to the finish line .
by this point , russia had already taken command of the race , with olga zaitseva rounding off the team effort with an accumulative time of 1:09:36.3 , almost 33 seconds ahead of the second-placed french team .
germany finished just over 37 seconds off the leaders ' pace .
neuner had earlier pulled out of the race citing exhaustion , leaving a team consisting of henkel , kati wilhelm , simone hauswald and martina beck to battle it out together .
beck admitted the neuner 's decision not to race was a significant blow for the team 's chances .
" at first , i could n't say anything , " she said .
" i was so shocked .
i had lots of pressure on me today .
it was probably the hardest race of my life . "
the bronze medal leaves germany sitting in second place on the games medal count , with seven gold , nine silver and seven bronze medals .

' a turkish court has formally charged and jailed seven senior turkish military officers for allegedly plotting to overthrow the islamic-leaning government back in 2003 .
the european commission said it was concerned about the " serious allegations " of coup plotting , and called for ankara to run fair trials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan 's akp party wants the army out of politics " turkish citizens are entitled to hear the entire truth on these cases , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner stefan fule said .
" that 's why the investigation must be exemplary and carried out in full respect of the principles and standards of a fair judicial process . "
fanning the flames the wiretap evidence and discovery of alleged military plans drafted in 2003 to overthrow the government led to the detention of about 50 commanders monday .
a court in istanbul ordered that four admirals , an army general and two staff colonels be jailed .
the controversial probe has fanned tensions in the already polarized country , dramatically escalating tensions between the military-backed secular establishment , and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp party .
the akp , which came to power in 2002 , is the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement .
monday 's arrests prompted an emergency meeting tuesday of the army 's four-star generals and admirals to discuss the " serious situation , " a brief army statement said .
bid to discredit the army ?
akp supporters say the army , which has unseated four governments and has traditionally wielded heavy political influence , must be forced to stop meddling in politics .
but opponents charge the akp is using the guise of democratization to discredit the army , seen as the bulwark of the secular system .
the purported coup plot , codenamed " operation sledgehammer " , was allegedly drawn up in 2003 at the istanbul-based first army , shortly after the akp came to power. jen / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state media reported the protestors were carrying posters reading " civil rights ! " and " capital beijing , brutal demolition " .
rights activists say the police confiscated the posters and stopped them from reaching tiananmen square to hold the demonstration . the artists say they took to the streets after scores of masked men assaulted some of the artists in an attempt to forcibly evict them from their studios .
they claim the men were sent by real estate developers .
among those seriously injured were wu yuren , a 39 year old a photographer , satoshi iwama , a japanese artist and artist liu yi who received 16 stitches after a blow to the head .
" the leader of gang took away my cell phone and instructed his four or five men to beat me with wooden planks and iron bars , " recalls liu yi .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .

in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .

they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "

top german protestant bishop caught drunk driving she is my kind of bishop .
we need more like her . - alan garfield , great britain bishop margot has proved she is human with all its faults .
but when you head-up such an organization is not more expected of you ?
go back to the bible , and see the qualities required of such leaders and reconsider your position with dignity and do n't wait for the embarrassment for all of calls for your resignation .
leaders are always under attack so i would call for every christian to pray for her and for the church she heads . - john robinson , spain the bishop made a mistake - she admits it , the public prosecutor will indubitably prosecute her under the law and she will plead guilty .
the likely penalty is a 30-day sentence and a year 's driving ban .
the suggestion that she should resign is ridiculous .
she shows that she is human !
good ! - richard spencer , great britain the russian orthodox church is right : a female priest in a christian church is against all traditions and scriptures .
luther would not have approved !
she is right to be against the german involvement in afghanistan but wrong to drive in a drunken state .
luther was not against enjoying a good drink ! - krapotkin , us germany urges catholic church to come clean on child abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaessmann has been criticized by the russian orthodox church for being unsuitable please have a party investigate and not just rely on the church to " come clean . "
self reporting does not report everything .
the german church will needs outside investigation to avoid cover-ups .
in the us the catholic church self-reported to the john jay study .
grand jury investigations in philadelphia revealed a different picture than the john jay report because people outside the hierarchy of the church did the investigation . - aline frybarger , us the sex abuse crimes committed by members of the catholic church throughout the western world , and not prosecuted to the full extent of the law , clearly show that our so-called secular democracies are just a farce and mockery .
when a church recognizes through a statement of their own " ... that significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety and young people ... " involved in church-led activities , it also clearly shows that theocratic centralism -lrb- through the vatican and its subordinates -rrb- must be eliminated for the safety of a country and its people .
i recommend that all services of the catholic church be suspended until a full investigation is completed . - hans reuther-fix , antigua the church has worked very hard to hide the scandal regarding sex abuse by priests .
they have spent huge sums of money for lawyers and public relations firms to help them in their cover-up .
their actions have been extremely un-christian . - charles reisz , us these priests are worse than so-called " ordinary pedophiles , " because they call themselves men of god .
they are hypocrites and should not only be kicked out of the church for good , but should also serve some time in prison , and their details kept on file so that they can never apply again to another church , somewhere else , in the future . - karen j. hardman , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 24.02.2010 cartel authority faces payback after court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonn-based federal cartel authority has been reined in by the court decision the german federal cartel authority may have to pay back millions of euros to major companies after a state court ruled it has been setting fines too high for the past three years . judges at the higher regional court in dusseldorf have ruled that the fine structure employed by the federal cartel authority needs to be amended , according to a report by the financial daily newspaper handelsblatt .
as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .

the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .

members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .

new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

a spokesperson for italy 's largest environmental organization legambiente called the spill " an unparalleled ecological disaster " and said the consequences would be present in the ecosystem for a long time . italian officials said the spill was caused by intentional sabotage at an oil depot , where vandals opened the cisterns , allowing some 2.5 million liters -lrb- 660,000 gallons -rrb- of oil to flow into the lambro river . the cisterns " were opened by someone who was familiar with the plant and knew how to operate them , " cinzia secchi , a spokeswoman for the local government in milan told ap .
the northern italian city is connected to the po river through a series of channels . from bad to worse after overtaking three separate barriers created to obstruct the flow , the stream of sludge spilled into the po .
the po , which runs through several important italian cities , including turin and piacenza , is a source of irrigation for the country . environmental experts warn of impending havoc if the spill is not soon contained .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said .

" syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the slick has reached italy 's most important river , the po . environmental activists warned of a pending disaster in italy on wednesday as a massive oil slick made its way from a small river in northern italy into the country 's longest and most important river .
a spokesperson for italy 's largest environmental organization legambiente called the spill " an unparalleled ecological disaster " and said the consequences would be present in the ecosystem for a long time . italian officials said the spill was caused by intentional sabotage at an oil depot , where vandals opened the cisterns , allowing some 2.5 million liters -lrb- 660,000 gallons -rrb- of oil to flow into the lambro river . the cisterns " were opened by someone who was familiar with the plant and knew how to operate them , " cinzia secchi , a spokeswoman for the local government in milan told ap .
the northern italian city is connected to the po river through a series of channels . from bad to worse after overtaking three separate barriers created to obstruct the flow , the stream of sludge spilled into the po .
the po , which runs through several important italian cities , including turin and piacenza , is a source of irrigation for the country . environmental experts warn of impending havoc if the spill is not soon contained .
the po river valley is an important agricultural region in italy , and the area is home to a diverse array of birds and wildlife . smh / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 24.02.2010 cartel authority faces payback after court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonn-based federal cartel authority has been reined in by the court decision the german federal cartel authority may have to pay back millions of euros to major companies after a state court ruled it has been setting fines too high for the past three years . judges at the higher regional court in dusseldorf have ruled that the fine structure employed by the federal cartel authority needs to be amended , according to a report by the financial daily newspaper handelsblatt .
as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 24.02.2010 cartel authority faces payback after court ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonn-based federal cartel authority has been reined in by the court decision the german federal cartel authority may have to pay back millions of euros to major companies after a state court ruled it has been setting fines too high for the past three years . judges at the higher regional court in dusseldorf have ruled that the fine structure employed by the federal cartel authority needs to be amended , according to a report by the financial daily newspaper handelsblatt .
as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .

now the slick has reached italy 's most important river , the po . environmental activists warned of a pending disaster in italy on wednesday as a massive oil slick made its way from a small river in northern italy into the country 's longest and most important river .
a spokesperson for italy 's largest environmental organization legambiente called the spill " an unparalleled ecological disaster " and said the consequences would be present in the ecosystem for a long time . italian officials said the spill was caused by intentional sabotage at an oil depot , where vandals opened the cisterns , allowing some 2.5 million liters -lrb- 660,000 gallons -rrb- of oil to flow into the lambro river . the cisterns " were opened by someone who was familiar with the plant and knew how to operate them , " cinzia secchi , a spokeswoman for the local government in milan told ap .
the northern italian city is connected to the po river through a series of channels . from bad to worse after overtaking three separate barriers created to obstruct the flow , the stream of sludge spilled into the po .
the po , which runs through several important italian cities , including turin and piacenza , is a source of irrigation for the country . environmental experts warn of impending havoc if the spill is not soon contained .
the po river valley is an important agricultural region in italy , and the area is home to a diverse array of birds and wildlife . smh / ap / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

a test showed her blood alcohol level to be 0.154 percent , three times the legal limit for driving in germany , prosecutors said .
" i am shocked at myself for committing such a grievous error , " kaessmann had told bild newspaper .
" i am aware how dangerous and irresponsible it is to drink and drive .
i will accept the legal consequences . "
she will face criminal proceedings for drunk driving , which could include a fine of one month 's salary and loss of driving privileges for up to a year , prosecutors said .
historic election kaessmann was elected in october 2009 to be the first woman to head the protestant church in germany , an umbrella organization that unites germany 's 25 million protestant christians . she was a controversial choice , because she was divorced .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..

himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well .

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .

he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .

in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .

their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "

the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 24.02.2010 china artists protest forced eviction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people protesting against forced evictions in beijing about 20 artists protested in central beijing on monday over the demolition of an art zone in the east of the capital .
the state media reported the protestors were carrying posters reading " civil rights ! " and " capital beijing , brutal demolition " .
rights activists say the police confiscated the posters and stopped them from reaching tiananmen square to hold the demonstration . the artists say they took to the streets after scores of masked men assaulted some of the artists in an attempt to forcibly evict them from their studios .
they claim the men were sent by real estate developers .
among those seriously injured were wu yuren , a 39 year old a photographer , satoshi iwama , a japanese artist and artist liu yi who received 16 stitches after a blow to the head .
" the leader of gang took away my cell phone and instructed his four or five men to beat me with wooden planks and iron bars , " recalls liu yi .
" how i finally ended up on the ground , i can not remember . "
developers and the authorities over a dozen artists ' villages such as zhengyang are facing demolition in beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outspoken artist ai weiwei was among the protestors the artists living there say the developers want them to move out of the land and make way for commercial buildings and malls .
this comes despite the fact that they have signed leases of 20-30 years with developers .
in december , the electricity , water and gas supplies of some of the buildings were cut off by landlords .
the artists believe the developers are aided in their land grabs by local authorities .
" officials and business people act together , " says liu .
" it 's all about money .
they keep the mafia guys for their own purposes . "
the local authorities have denied the charges .
they have promised an investigation into the recent incidences of assaults .
the head of chaoyang district , where the village zhengyang is located , has ordered local authorities to install video cameras there and to protect the artists .
meanwhile the artists have vowed not to bow down to the developers ’ demands .
" this is an issue of dignity , " says wu yuren .
" everyone has the right to live with dignity , but there have been attempts to take that dignity away from us . "
they want to continue their protests. du / rk / afp editor : thomas bärthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the authorities have reacted cautiously , awaiting a formal proposal from the rebels .
as the standoff continues , there are voices of caution from civil society that an armed confrontation could further hurt the marginalized . home minister p. chidambaram and maoist leader koteshwar rao alias kishenji exchanged numbers on tuesday even as they refused to talk to each other a day after the fearsome maoist leader proposed a conditional ceasefire .
the home minister rejected the offer , saying the government would not accept any " ifs and buts " for talks , and instead asked the outlawed communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- to come out with a statement pledging to " abjure violence " .
just after kishenji 's offer , armed left-wing rebels attacked a police camp in west bengal 's west midnapore district .
officials saw this development as a sign that the maoists could not be trusted , while others hinted at a rift in the rebel ranks .
military offensive the truce offer comes as a massive military offensive to eliminate the maoists has been launched in the rebel strongholds of chhattisgarh , orissa , jharkhand , bihar and west bengal , worst-hit by the insurgency .
the operation is expected to involve nearly 20,000 specially trained personnel drawn from the paramilitary and state police forces ..
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's home minister p. chidambaram wants maoists to make a formal request for talks however , civil society groups have argued that the collateral damage to deprived tribal populations in these strongholds could be immense and alienate them even further from the state .
himanshi kumar , a social activist from dantewada , a maoist hotbed in chhattisgarh , was forced to flee from the place after 17 years .
he says it is not the maoists who are the chief perpetrators of " violence on the people " .
" you see the tribals are now considering the indian state as an offender , an aggressor , " says kumar .
" in these situations they are considering naxalites as their protectors .
it should not have happened , but this is the reality . "
discontent among villagers last year alone , maoist violence accounted for over 1100 deaths , the largest seen in recent years .
linga , a tribal from chhattisgarh , was forced to flee his village after being dubbed a maoist supporter .
" people are not happy with the steps taken by the security forces and the state administration , " he says .
" the steps they have taken have not helped .
villagers are picking up guns and joining the maoists .
we have to fight for our dignity .
we simply have not got justice .
more and more people are not supporting the government and instead joining the maoists . "
there have been words of restraint even from security experts , like ajay sahni .
" now we do not have the capacities to hold the entire affected areas in these 5-6 badly affected states , " he cautions .
" we can not hold all of them down .
so basically what you are going to do is squeeze in one area and cause an escalation in other areas . and you are going to cause a tremendous escalation in terms of ied attacks , ambushes against security forces in transit in wide areas and possible escalation of violence against civilians as well . "
this particular phase could well be the proverbial lull before the storm .

police had caught her driving drunk . the head of the lutheran church in germany , margot kaessmann , announced her resignation at a press conference on wednesday after being pulled over for drunk driving days before .
" one of my advisers said stick to what your heart tells you to do , " kaessmann told reporters .
" and my heart tells me clearly that i can not stay in office without losing much of the authority i 'd need for the post . "
her resignation as head of germany 's protestants and hanover 's bishop is effective immediately , but she will remain a pastor in the local hanover church . kaessmann 's decision to resign came despite a vote of confidence from fellow protestant leaders . police had stopped the 51-year-old , who was driving a car provided by the church , for running a red light in hanover on saturday night .
a test showed her blood alcohol level to be 0.154 percent , three times the legal limit for driving in germany , prosecutors said .
" i am shocked at myself for committing such a grievous error , " kaessmann had told bild newspaper .
" i am aware how dangerous and irresponsible it is to drink and drive .
i will accept the legal consequences . "
she will face criminal proceedings for drunk driving , which could include a fine of one month 's salary and loss of driving privileges for up to a year , prosecutors said .
historic election kaessmann was elected in october 2009 to be the first woman to head the protestant church in germany , an umbrella organization that unites germany 's 25 million protestant christians . she was a controversial choice , because she was divorced .
kaessmann was viewed as a modernizer and a supporter of improving ties with catholics .
she gained attention recently by calling for a pullout of german troops from afghanistan , saying there was no such thing as a just war. acb / smh / epd / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .

" one of my advisers said stick to what your heart tells you to do , " kaessmann told reporters .

her resignation as head of germany 's protestants and hanover 's bishop is effective immediately , but she will remain a pastor in the local hanover church . kaessmann 's decision to resign came despite a vote of confidence from fellow protestant leaders . police had stopped the 51-year-old , who was driving a car provided by the church , for running a red light in hanover on saturday night .
a test showed her blood alcohol level to be 0.154 percent , three times the legal limit for driving in germany , prosecutors said .
" i am shocked at myself for committing such a grievous error , " kaessmann had told bild newspaper .
" i am aware how dangerous and irresponsible it is to drink and drive .
i will accept the legal consequences . "
she will face criminal proceedings for drunk driving , which could include a fine of one month 's salary and loss of driving privileges for up to a year , prosecutors said .
historic election kaessmann was elected in october 2009 to be the first woman to head the protestant church in germany , an umbrella organization that unites germany 's 25 million protestant christians . she was a controversial choice , because she was divorced .
kaessmann was viewed as a modernizer and a supporter of improving ties with catholics .
she gained attention recently by calling for a pullout of german troops from afghanistan , saying there was no such thing as a just war. acb / smh / epd / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
top german protestant bishop caught drunk driving she is my kind of bishop .
we need more like her . - alan garfield , great britain bishop margot has proved she is human with all its faults .
but when you head-up such an organization is not more expected of you ?
go back to the bible , and see the qualities required of such leaders and reconsider your position with dignity and do n't wait for the embarrassment for all of calls for your resignation .
leaders are always under attack so i would call for every christian to pray for her and for the church she heads . - john robinson , spain the bishop made a mistake - she admits it , the public prosecutor will indubitably prosecute her under the law and she will plead guilty .
the likely penalty is a 30-day sentence and a year 's driving ban .
the suggestion that she should resign is ridiculous .
she shows that she is human !
good ! - richard spencer , great britain the russian orthodox church is right : a female priest in a christian church is against all traditions and scriptures .
luther would not have approved !
she is right to be against the german involvement in afghanistan but wrong to drive in a drunken state .
luther was not against enjoying a good drink ! - krapotkin , us germany urges catholic church to come clean on child abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaessmann has been criticized by the russian orthodox church for being unsuitable please have a party investigate and not just rely on the church to " come clean . "
self reporting does not report everything .
the german church will needs outside investigation to avoid cover-ups .
in the us the catholic church self-reported to the john jay study .
grand jury investigations in philadelphia revealed a different picture than the john jay report because people outside the hierarchy of the church did the investigation . - aline frybarger , us the sex abuse crimes committed by members of the catholic church throughout the western world , and not prosecuted to the full extent of the law , clearly show that our so-called secular democracies are just a farce and mockery .
when a church recognizes through a statement of their own " ... that significant measures have now been taken to ensure the safety and young people ... " involved in church-led activities , it also clearly shows that theocratic centralism -lrb- through the vatican and its subordinates -rrb- must be eliminated for the safety of a country and its people .
i recommend that all services of the catholic church be suspended until a full investigation is completed . - hans reuther-fix , antigua the church has worked very hard to hide the scandal regarding sex abuse by priests .
they have spent huge sums of money for lawyers and public relations firms to help them in their cover-up .
their actions have been extremely un-christian . - charles reisz , us these priests are worse than so-called " ordinary pedophiles , " because they call themselves men of god .
they are hypocrites and should not only be kicked out of the church for good , but should also serve some time in prison , and their details kept on file so that they can never apply again to another church , somewhere else , in the future . - karen j. hardman , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "
other authors have supported hegemann 's position , viewing plagiarism as an avant-garde copy-and-paste process and " literary remix " as a tolerable , modern form of art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann compared herself to a dj recognized contemporary german author durs gruenbein seemingly defended the young author tuesday in a guest commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
in an interview published wednesday , however , he revealed that the commentary had itself been an act of plagiarism : 99 percent of it was taken from an essay written by gottfried benn in 1926 concerning alleged plagiarism in a book that , coincidentally , had also been released by the publisher of " axolotl roadkill , " ullstein verlag . ultimately , " it was n't about ms hegemann , " gruenbein told the paper .
" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .
but that does n't mean that everyone else can do the same thing . even when the artistic method of borrowing is being implemented , the source always needs to be mentioned , said josef limper , a cologne-based attorney specializing in media law and copyright . that 's precisely what hegemann failed to do in " axolotl roadkill " - regardless of whether the lifted passages are considered artistic sampling or outright plagiarism . the 18-year-old has since apologized to the writers she copied , particularly the berlin blogger known as airen .
hegemann used passages from his novel " strobo " in some 20 places in her book .
the publisher ullstein verlag , also responded by adding a six-page source list in the fourth edition of the novel . the never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gruenbein " plagiarized " to prove a point that could have been the end of the plagiarism debate surrounding the teenager 's book - if it were n't just for show .
the literary quality of hegemann 's work was never at the heart of the discussion , said literary journalist hubert winkels .
according to him , many of the critics exaggerated the plagiarism claims because they were disappointed that hegemann never led the wild and sexy party life of the book 's protagonist mifti . when " axolotl roadkill " first came out , some critics thought they were reading about the essence of real life , " about today 's youth in all its depravation , " explained winkels .
" and then it turned out to be just literature-literature and they felt so betrayed that they tried to undermine the author . " according to winkels , the premature and very public praise and subsequent criticism of hegemann 's novel shows germany 's literary critics " from their worst side . " the plagiarism debate has been around for centuries and the hegemann case likely wo n't be the end of it .
if nietzsche was right it will come back to haunt the literary community once again when " axolotl roadkill " becomes the inspiration for a new novel . author : gisa funck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : stuart tiffen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .

the move shows madrid 's support of us efforts to close the controversial prison . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba said the first inmate from the us prison at guantanamo bay had arrived in his country .
madrid has agreed to host five prisoners , the largest commitment yet from a european country .
citing privacy concerns , rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner 's name or any identifying information , except to say he was a palestinian .
the new arrival will be able to work and move around spain as he wishes , but will not be able to leave the country .
" he is a palestinian , he has already arrived in our country .
we do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally , " he told a news conference .
spain urges others to ' do the utmost ' spain 's decision to take five guantanamo detainees is part of an effort to help us president barack obama with his plans to shut down the jail .

spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos has urged other european countries " to do their utmost " to take in former guantanamo detainees as well .
third countries are being asked to take in detainees who are cleared of any charges , but who ca n't be sent back to their homelands for fear of persecution .
obama had said he would close the prison by january 22 , 2010 , yet the deadline passed unmet .

as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

the dutch queen has named a date for new elections and several ministers in a caretaker goverment following a coalition collapse over the weekend .
but the composition of the next parliament is less certain . queen beatrix has set a june 9 date for new general elections in the netherlands , according to a government statement issued tuesday .
she also has appointed several new ministers to replace the 12 labor party members who resigned after their coalition with the christian democrats collapsed on saturday . the government collapsed after the labor members refused to support a request to extend the netherlands ' troop presence in afghanistan .
members of the christian democrats and the christian union will form a caretaker government to carry out basic decision-making until a new cabinet can be sworn in .
caretaker prime minister jan peter balkenende said he would work with parliament to identify which issues should be classified as " controversial , " meaning they would n't be taken up until after the elections .
new ministers , new coalitions among the queen 's first appointments was jan kees de jager as finance minister .
de jager will have the task of preparing an austerity budget , continuing to track down tax cheats , and making a deal with iceland regarding repayment of funds paid out to dutch customers who lost money in icelandic banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende will remain in a limited power role as caretaker prime minister the collapse of the coalition has put into question which parties will form the next government . one labor party leader , frans timmermans , drew criticism on tuesday after saying that his party would never form a coalition with the far-right freedom party of geert wilders .
" the labor party stands for a completely different holland than the party of wilders , and for that reason we can not be in a government with him , " a labor spokeswoman said .
" he -lsb- timmermans -rsb- dared other parties to think the same thing .
do they want to be in a government that segregates people by race and religion ? "
christian democrat party chairman pieter van geel described timmermans ' comments as foolish , while the leader of the socialist sp , agnes kant , said they were " undemocratic . "
others expressed fears that timmermans ' tactics could backfire and push more voters to wilders ' party , which did well in recent opinion polls .
his party is already the second largest dutch party in the european parliament .
wilders himself referred to timmermans ' calls as " arrogant " and told dutch media " the voter will seek punishment for this . " svs / dpa / reuters editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .
coffee giants tchibo , melitta , dallmayr and food company kraft were found guilty of routinely agreeing on coffee prices since 2000 .
all four companies declined to comment on tuesday 's report , since they have already appealed the fine and the court case is ongoing .
the dusseldorf court 's decision was sparked by a complaint from a group of cement companies , including heidelberg cement , which was slapped with a 650-million-euro fine last year .
following an appeal , the fine imposed on the alleged cartel was reduced in june 2009 to 330 million euros .
the cartel authority has established a history of imposing heavy fines since a new fine structure was introduced in 2006 .
it demanded 165 million euros from a group of six companies and eight individuals in the roofing industry in december 2008 , and in 2007 , seven liquid gas companies were fined a total of 208 million euros for agreeing not to compete for each other 's customers .
altogether , in the past three years since the new fine regulations were introduced , the cartel authority has demanded roughly one billion euros in fines - more than ever before .
not so drastic but the cartel authority strongly refuted the handelsblatt report , denying that it had ever reached the 10 percent cap when imposing fines , and that most were significantly below the limit .
speaking to deutsche welle , cartel authority spokesman kay weidner said : " we were very surprised at how negative today 's handelsblatt story was , and to be honest it was slightly bad form not to give us the opportunity to explain . "
" in the majority of cases the court agrees with our calculation of the fine , " weidner said .
" we base fines on how much the offending companies would have made if the prices had not been agreed .
if that figure exceeds 10 percent of the turnover , then we impose the cap .
as you can imagine , these calculations are extremely complicated , and in some cases , as in the case of the cement cartel , economic experts dispute our assessment .
in that case the court decided to reduce the fine . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authority has grown more assertive in recent years a bracket , not a cap weidner said that the dusseldorf court did make the subtle but important decision to change the 10 percent cap into a bracket - in other words , fines will end up somewhere between zero and ten percent , depending on a range of factors - as when sentences are passed in normal criminal court cases .
" the objective truth is no-one knows what effect this decision will have - it 's just as likely that many fines will be higher as that they will be lower , " weidner said .
although some anti-trust lawyers said that the decision would have a big effect on how the cartel authority works , no actual changes can be made until the ruling has been referred to germany 's constitutional court .
it is hoped that a final ruling will be made some time this year .
in a press statement , cartel authority president andreas mundt said : " until there is a final decision from the constitutional court , the cartel authority sees no reason to change its fine policy . "
mundt added that the authority 's fine structure was in line with the policy of the european commission and most eu member states .

in literature , borrowing is nothing new .
the debate on plagiarism in germany - sparked by lifted passages in a teenager 's new novel - has annoyed authors .
one even pulled a public prank to reveal the absurdity of it all . the ghost of plagiarism has come back to haunt the literary scene in germany once again . the young berlin author helene hegemann , who turned 18 last weekend , recently admitted to lifting long passages by another author .
but she was n't the first .
last december , rumors circulated in the german press that hamburg director fatih akin had copied sections of alexander wall 's novel " hotel monopol " for his film " soul kitchen . " then in january , writer uwe tellkamp was accused of borrowing from jens wonneberger for his bestseller " der turm " -lrb- " the tower " -rrb- .
britain 's star author j.k. rowling has also recently been taken to court for similarities between " harry potter and the goblet of fire " and a book by adrian jacobs . copying has many names indeed , literature always contains something borrowed : every author is also a reader , roland koch , professor for creative writing at siegen university , told deutsche welle . " everything i read and perceive in my everyday life flows through me and comes out in my writing at some point , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hegemann is selling books , at least the line between true plagiarism and permissible inspiration is a fine one - an author does n't always know where his or her ideas come from , said koch .
he recently wrote a short story that he dedicated to writer frank schulz , since it had been influenced by schulz ' novel " das ouzo-orakel " -lrb- " the ouzo oracle " -rrb- . " i read the ouzo oracle a while ago and enjoyed it , " said koch , " and i do n't know whether maybe i unintentionally took something from the book .
but of course that 's different from sitting down and copying it word for word . " literary history is teeming with famous authors who borrowed - some more , some less - from their colleagues . it 's documented , for example , that 19th century german dramatist and writer georg buechner based his short story " lenz " on the diary of father j.f. oberlin .
and walter kempowski 's " echolot " -lrb- " sonar " -rrb- is unthinkable without the letters and autobiographical reports of contemporary witnesses of world war ii .
thomas mann even wrote a whole book about the authors whose works he incorporated into his " doctor faustus . " everything repeats itself it 's probably never been so difficult to enforce copyright as in the age of the internet , where an infringement is just a mouse-click away and has long become a bagatelle .
helene hegemann compared herself to a dj , who " mixes everything with everything , " as one of the protagonists in her novel " axolotl roadkill " puts it . " originality " does n't exist anymore , hegemann told the press in the wake of the plagiarism claims - " only genuineness . "
then she promptly called for an end to " copyright excesses . "

" it was about this crazy literary debate . the buechner prize-winning author said he hoped , with his little trick , to illustrate friedrich nietzsche 's principle that everything repeats itself . making it right again legally speaking , however , it 's doubtful that an unlimited right to copy will apply to the literature of the future .
granted , germany 's federal constitutional court in june 2000 found that the berthold brecht quotations in heiner mueller 's play " germania 3 " were an acceptable artistic method .

as a result , many of the fines that the authority has charged companies in the past three years could be up for appeal .
fines for illegal price-fixing agreements between companies are currently capped at 10 percent of the offending company 's turnover from the previous year .
the report said that while the cartel authority habitually demands the maximum fine , courts often set the fines lower after extenuating circumstances - such as the offending company 's cooperation with the investigation - are taken into account .
dusseldorf court spokesman ulrich egger confirmed the report to deutsche welle , but warned that the ruling did not require a complete overhaul of the fine system .
" the decision affects the criteria by which the 10 percent cap is calculated , " egger said .
" it is obviously not an automatic process - each case is evaluated separately . "
he added that the maximum fine should only be imposed in particularly grave cases .
bildunterschrift : germany 's major coffee companies were slapped with a hefty fine last year tendency to lower fines " it 's true that the decision will mean a tendency towards lower fines , " egger said , explaining that fines that were not yet legally binding could be appealed - including the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 218-million -rrb- fine imposed on four major coffee companies in december last year .

revised figures show the country has breached eu deficit rules for the first time since 2005 . newly released data from the federal statistics office showed that state spending , boosted by efforts to fighting the economic and financial crisis , pushed the deficit to 79.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 107.2 billion -rrb- .
that 's 3.3 percent of gross domestic product .
this means germany has overstepping the budget-deficit limits set for eu countries by the maastricht treaty at 3 percent of gdp for the first time since 2005 .
hard hit by stimulus spending the deficit-limit rule is aimed at securing the stability of the euro currency .
statistics for 2009 first published in january had shown a deficit of 77.2 billion euros , or 3.2 percent of gdp .
the poor result was expected , since the economic stimulus package , government subsidies for short-time employment , and falling tax revenues have all been a burden on public spending .
the german central bank is predicting even more red ink - a budget deficit of 5 percent - for 2010. jen / dpaafp -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move shows madrid 's support of us efforts to close the controversial prison . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba said the first inmate from the us prison at guantanamo bay had arrived in his country .
madrid has agreed to host five prisoners , the largest commitment yet from a european country .
citing privacy concerns , rubalcaba refused to give the prisoner 's name or any identifying information , except to say he was a palestinian .

" he is a palestinian , he has already arrived in our country .
we do not want to give out further details because we want everyone who comes to live in our country to be able to live their lives normally , " he told a news conference .

obama had said he would close the prison by january 22 , 2010 , yet the deadline passed unmet .

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "

' a turkish court has formally charged and jailed seven senior turkish military officers for allegedly plotting to overthrow the islamic-leaning government back in 2003 .
the european commission said it was concerned about the " serious allegations " of coup plotting , and called for ankara to run fair trials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan 's akp party wants the army out of politics " turkish citizens are entitled to hear the entire truth on these cases , " a spokeswoman for eu enlargement commissioner stefan fule said .
" that 's why the investigation must be exemplary and carried out in full respect of the principles and standards of a fair judicial process . "
fanning the flames the wiretap evidence and discovery of alleged military plans drafted in 2003 to overthrow the government led to the detention of about 50 commanders monday .
a court in istanbul ordered that four admirals , an army general and two staff colonels be jailed .
the controversial probe has fanned tensions in the already polarized country , dramatically escalating tensions between the military-backed secular establishment , and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp party .
the akp , which came to power in 2002 , is the offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement .
monday 's arrests prompted an emergency meeting tuesday of the army 's four-star generals and admirals to discuss the " serious situation , " a brief army statement said .
bid to discredit the army ?
akp supporters say the army , which has unseated four governments and has traditionally wielded heavy political influence , must be forced to stop meddling in politics .
but opponents charge the akp is using the guise of democratization to discredit the army , seen as the bulwark of the secular system .
the purported coup plot , codenamed " operation sledgehammer " , was allegedly drawn up in 2003 at the istanbul-based first army , shortly after the akp came to power. jen / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewed ties between the two countries bring cautious hope of breakthroughs on a number of issues . in terms of making progress in rehabilitating relations between itself and countries in the middle east , the united states could have only trumped its reengagement with syria by opening direct dialogue with iran .
washington and damascus have been openly opposed to each other for the past six years and suspicious of each others motives for many decades longer .
the animosity between the two countries has only been eclipsed by that between the us and iran .
but last week 's meeting between william burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , and president bashar al-assad suggests that syria 's period of international isolation is coming to an end and that washington has realized that if it wants to successfully engage with the middle east , it must do so with the help of damascus .
president barack obama has made reengagement with the middle east one of his main foreign policy platforms after the damage caused to relations by the administration of george w. bush .
but obama has seen his efforts to directly engage iran and broker peace between israel and the palestinians founder in his first year in office ; his approach to syria may be aimed at seeking a new way to ease the deadlock by approaching rival nations with the support of damascus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants more engagement in the middle east while the strained ties between washington and damascus stretch back much farther than the low points of the bush presidency , no high-level meetings have taken place since the us slapped sanctions on syria , froze diplomatic relations and recalled its ambassador in 2005 .
washington 's ties with damascus had been strained by syria 's three-decade-old alliance with iran and us allegations of meddling in the affairs of its eastern neighbor iraq .
syrian support for lebanon 's shiite militant group hezbollah and the palestinian islamist movement hamas which rules gaza have also proved a stumbling block .
the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri in february 2005 in a bombing blamed on syria also strained relations .
but obama 's decision to appoint us diplomat robert ford as the new ambassador to syria , lift an advisory travel warning for us citizens traveling to syria , and reopen direct lines of communication have been welcomed by damascus , although both sides accept that there would be challenges ahead as they move toward restoring diplomatic engagement .
" the us have an interest in an rapprochement to syria since there is a hope that syria could play a more constructive part in the future of the region , " konstantin kirsten , a middle east expert at the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" from the us side , syria might be hoped to take a more pragmatic stance in the region and at the same time distance itself more from its close ally iran . " obama hoping for syrian progress on iran to silence critics obama has already begun to feel the heat over this rapprochement at home after republicans once again turned on the president for his open-handed approach to governments considered hostile to washington , with some criticizing the move toward syria as a " reckless engagement " and a reward for an enemy of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria is unlikely to go too far in helping the us with iran the president will be hoping that the returns on his act of faith will be enough to silence his critics , especially as he considers syria 's involvement integral to the peaceful resolution of the on-going stand-off with iran and the israeli-palestinian situation .
syria is said to be determined to help its ally iran and the west engage in a " constructive " dialogue over tehran 's contested nuclear program , although damascus has made it clear that increased sanctions are not the answer .
dr. muriel asseburg , head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , believes that washington remains realistic as to how far syria will go to help with the iranian problem . " when it comes iran , there is no false hope in the us that it could use syria to pressure iran on its regional posture and its nuclear program , " she told deutsche welle .
" however , the us does want syria to distance itself from iran ’ s radical stances and to realign its geopolitical orientation toward the west and the pro-western arab states . "
us , syria want dialogue over israel but for different reasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to ease tensions between israel and syria on the israel-palestinian question , syria 's assad has made it clear that the united states has an important role in the peace process and a warming up of syrian-us diplomatic ties could one day help the resumption of direct negotiations between syria and israel .
he says that washington must " adopt a policy which pushes israel to accept the demands for peace . "
dr. asseburg believes that while syria sees the need for us involvement in the peace process to bring israel to the table , damascus needs the us involved for its own purposes .
" in terms of the syrian-israeli dimension , the us has an interest in calming the current tensions and set a more positive tone .
the rhetoric between israel , syria and lebanon over the past weeks has escalated considerably and there has been talk of the next war implicating syria and being even worse than the last .
the us has no interest in letting this rhetoric escalate even further . "
" syria also knows that it will see no progress in regaining the golan heights if the united states is not involved in a peace process with israel , " she added . washington wants damascus to exert influence on militants the united states is also keen to cooperate with syria in its fight against international terrorism although syria 's stakeholding in lebanon through hezbollah is likely to prove a long-term impediment to better ties as is syrian support for hamas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington wants syrian action on hezbollah and hamas " the us is interested in syria having an impact on militant groups such as hamas which are based in damascus , " dr. asseburg said . " syria has shown in the past that it is willing to impact on these groups and pressure them into taking a more conciliatory approach . " syria wants us recognition in return while the us has much to gain from its rapprochement with syria , it is not a one-way street . " in terms of what syria wants in return , damascus would be looking for us sanctions to be abolished , " dr asseburg said . " while some in syria say that the sanctions have had little effect , the us sanctions are felt in the financial and hi-tech industries as well as syria ’ s air fleet . " " syria also wants to increase its options by having good relations with the us and no longer being isolated by such an important power , " she added .
" they also do not like being considered as being part of what george w. bush termed the ' axis of evil . '
syria has a strong interest in being seen as part of the solution not part of the problem . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 24.02.2010 italian court convicts three google executives of privacy invasion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has called the verdict a threat to internet freedom three google executives have been sentenced to six months in prison by an italian court for invasion of privacy .
their case relates to a 2006 video that showed abuse of an autistic teenager . a milan court found three google executives guilty of invasion of privacy on wednesday in a case that , if upheld , could have radical implications on internet freedom and video hosting .
in addition to the six-month suspended sentence for the three defendants , judge oscar magi ordered google to pay a fine and the italian press to publish the decision .
he rejected additional charges of defamation .
the three defendants convicted in the trial were david drummond , chairman of the board of google italy at the time the video was uploaded ; george de los reyes , a board member who has since left google ; and peter fleischer , then responsible for privacy issues .
the court acquitted a fourth defendant , arvind desikan , who was in charge of google video at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fleischer was one of the defendants named in the case google spokesman bill echikson called the verdict " astonishing " and said the company would appeal the decision .
" none of these four people had anything to do with the video , " echikson told reporters .
" they did n't film it , they did n't upload it , they did n't review it .
nonetheless they were held criminally responsible . "
echikson added that if google is made responsible for vetting each video , " then the web as we know it will cease to exist . "
abusive classmates the video in question shows students an italian school bullying an autistic teenager as more than a dozen others stand by and watch .
it was filmed and uploaded to google video in late 2006 , and remained on the site for about two months before being taken down by google .
italian advocacy group vivi down , which along with the boy 's father brought on the case , claimed google was slow in responding to comments that the video should be removed .
the plaintiffs eventually dropped out of the case , but the italian court decided to continue prosecution .
legal consequences nick lockett , senior partner at the london-based legal firm dl legal , said he thought the case would have an enormous impact on all social media sites and outstanding data protection claims against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lockett says the verdict could affect how other websites approach data protection " lots of people have posted videos which clearly have privacy implications that may well now have to be reviewed , " locket told deutsche welle .
" i think google are absolutely right that this is going to highlight a move towards restriction of what can freely be distributed . "
lockett added that the case underlines problems with the european union 's data protection directive , which was meant to ensure companies in the eu could operate under the same rules in all eu member states .
in practice , he said , interpretation of the directive has varied from state to state .
" most multi-nationals have had to vet their operations in each individual european country , because the rules for enforcement are slightly different , " he said .
" and that is a huge regulatory cost for multi-national businesses .
antitrust complaints in a parallel story , the european commission confirmed wednesday that it was reviewing allegations of antitrust against google .
three european internet companies filed complaints to the eu executive body .
a blog post by google named them as uk-based price comparison website foundem , french legal search engine ejustice.fr and the microsoft subsidiary ciao from bing .
they claim google intentionally moved down their websites in search engine results .
google has denied breaking any laws and said it would cooperate with regulators .

the alexander " greek " thomson society hopes to raise £ 500,000 to bring the church on caledonia road , in the city 's gorbals area , back into public use .
the a-listed building was abandoned in 1962 and damaged by fire in 1965 .
the society wants to conserve its remains and develop galleries and a museum dedicated to the life and work of the stirlingshire-born architect .
public contribution its long-term plans , which involve buying the building from the council , would also see the addition of a cafe , studio spaces and serviced apartments for short-term letting .
sally white , secretary of the alexander thomson society , said : " the total cost of the project will be about £ 4.5m but we hope to raise about £ 500,000 through public contributions .
" ideally we would like to start on site sometime in 2011 with completion about 12 to 15 months later .
" but with the economic climate the way it is at the moment we ca n't be certain . "
alexander " greek " thomson was an eminent 19th century scottish architect and architectural theorist .
